## Response Strategies for Threats

When a risk threatens the project, you have four primary response strategies. The choice depends on the risk's importance, your organization's risk appetite, and the feasibility of different responses.

### Strategy 1: Avoid

**Avoid** means changing the project plan to eliminate the risk entirely. It's the most powerful response, but not always possible.

**Examples of avoidance**:
- Decide not to use a technology with unproven reliability; choose a proven alternative
- Simplify the technical architecture to reduce integration complexity
- Reduce scope to eliminate a risky feature
- Change the delivery schedule to provide more time
- Change resource plans to use more experienced staff

**When avoidance works**:
- Early in planning, when changes are inexpensive
- When the eliminated scope isn't critical
- When a safer alternative exists

**When avoidance doesn't work**:
- When the risk is inherent to the project (can't be avoided without eliminating the project)
- When alternative approaches carry different but equal risks
- When the cost of avoidance is too high

**Example from Sarah's projects**:

*Office Renovation*: One identified risk is that the current roof may need replacement if it's damaged during the renovation. Rather than risk an unexpected major cost, Sarah decides to include a roof inspection in the planning phase. If the roof is aging, she includes roof replacement as a distinct phase in the renovation. This avoids the risk of late-stage discovery.

*Expense System*: Early in the project, Sarah's team identifies the risk of using an unproven cloud platform. They evaluate alternatives: a more mature platform or building on the existing infrastructure. They avoid the technical risk of the unproven platform by choosing one with proven track record, accepting the trade-off that it's more expensive.

**Cost of avoidance**: Avoidance strategies often have costs:
- The roof inspection costs $5,000 upfront but prevents a potential $200,000 surprise
- The mature cloud platform costs 30% more than the innovative but unproven alternative
- Reducing scope eliminates revenue but ensures on-time, on-budget delivery

The project manager must decide: Is the cost of avoidance worth the reduction in risk?

### Strategy 2: Mitigate

**Mitigate** means reducing the probability of the risk occurring or reducing its impact if it does occur. It's the most common response strategy.

**Examples of mitigation**:
- **Reduce probability**: Hire experts to reduce technical risk, conduct prototyping to validate approach, use proven practices
- **Reduce impact**: Build redundancy, create backup plans, maintain extra inventory of critical parts, over-spec staffing

**How to develop mitigation plans**:
1. Identify what causes the risk (root cause)
2. Develop actions to prevent or weaken the cause
3. Estimate the cost of mitigation vs. the cost of the risk
4. Choose mitigation actions that pass the cost-benefit test

**Example from Sarah's office renovation**:

*Risk*: Permitting delays (identified as high probability, high impact)

*Root causes*: Permit office is understaffed; backlog varies with season; unclear requirements in initial submission

*Mitigation actions*:
- Engage the permit office early in the pre-design phase to clarify requirements (reduces probability)
- Submit permit applications during less busy seasons if possible (reduces probability)
- Budget 3-4 week buffer into the schedule (reduces impact by absorbing delay within project timeline)
- Assign a dedicated coordinator to track application status (reduces probability through active management)

*Cost-benefit*: The coordinator's time ($10,000) is worth avoiding the risk of a 4-week delay (which would cost $40,000 in overhead and lost productivity).

**Strengths of mitigation**:
- Addresses the root cause
- Often less costly than avoidance
- Flexible; can combine multiple actions
- Can reduce probability, impact, or both

**Limitations**:
- Doesn't eliminate the risk; residual risk remains
- Mitigation effectiveness is uncertain; the risk might still occur
- Takes active management; can't be "set and forget"

### Strategy 3: Accept

**Accept** means acknowledging the risk and deciding to deal with it if it occurs, rather than investing in prevention or reduction.

**When to accept**:
- Risk is low probability or low impact (doesn't justify active management)
- Mitigation or avoidance costs more than the risk's potential impact
- Risk is unavoidable (inherent to the project or industry)
- Organizational risk appetite allows accepting this uncertainty

**Two types of acceptance**:

1. **Passive acceptance**: Do nothing. If the risk occurs, you'll deal with it at that time. Most risks in the "accept" zone are passively accepted.

2. **Active acceptance**: Acknowledge the risk upfront and establish a contingency plan—what you'll do if it occurs. This gives you time to think through alternatives before you're in crisis mode.

**Example from Sarah's expense system**:

*Risk*: A key team member might leave the company mid-project (low probability for any individual, but moderate impact on a small team)

*Response*: Passive acceptance for most of the team (they're not critical path), but active acceptance for the technical lead. Sarah documents the architecture, creates design documentation, and ensures knowledge transfer throughout the project. If the tech lead leaves, the project can continue, though with some delay.

**Strengths**:
- Acknowledges reality; some risks can't be prevented
- Saves money for risks that probably won't occur
- Appropriate for low-impact risks

**Limitations**:
- Leaves you vulnerable if the risk occurs
- Requires contingency reserves to handle impacts
- Only works if you have the resources to respond when crisis hits

### The Risk Response Trade-off

These three strategies create a trade-off:

| Strategy | Cost | Control | Outcome |
|----------|------|---------|---------|
| **Avoid** | Often expensive | High | Risk eliminated, but may eliminate benefits |
| **Mitigate** | Moderate | Moderate | Risk reduced; some residual risk remains |
| **Accept** | Low upfront | Low | Risk remains; respond if it occurs |

Project managers balance these trade-offs based on:
- Risk appetite (willing to take on uncertainty?)
- Budget (resources available for mitigation?)
- Timeline (room to invest in risk reduction?)
- Criticality (how much would failure cost?)

## Response Strategies for Opportunities

Opportunities are positive risks. While threats are often managed reactively ("don't let bad things happen"), opportunities require proactive capture.

### Strategy 1: Exploit

**Exploit** means actively working to ensure the opportunity happens. It's the opposite of "avoid"—you're pursuing the positive outcome.

**Examples of exploitation**:
- A new technology emerges that could accelerate the project; invest in learning it and adopt it
- A vendor offers better pricing than expected; negotiate an even better price by ordering larger quantities
- Early wins generate executive enthusiasm; use this to secure additional funding or resources
- User adoption exceeds expectations; accelerate expansion to additional user groups

**How to exploit**:
1. Identify the conditions that would enable the opportunity
2. Invest resources to create those conditions
3. Monitor for signs that the opportunity is materializing
4. Capitalize quickly

**Example from Sarah's office renovation**:

*Opportunity*: If the organization can secure a bulk discount from the furniture vendor based on larger order volume, they could enhance the office aesthetic beyond the original plan.

*Exploitation strategy*:
- Research which furniture vendors offer volume discounts
- Consolidate orders across multiple departments
- Negotiate aggressively with the vendor
- If successful, allocate savings to premium finishes

*Cost*: Time spent in vendor negotiation, coordination with other departments

*Benefit*: Higher-quality final product at the same cost

### Strategy 2: Enhance

**Enhance** means increasing the probability or impact of the opportunity. It's similar to "mitigate" but for positive risks.

**Examples of enhancement**:
- Invest in team training to improve the likelihood of high-quality deliverables
- Add a more experienced architect to increase the probability of a scalable, elegant solution
- Allocate time for user research to increase the probability of high user adoption
- Build partnerships with technology leaders to increase access to emerging capabilities

**Example from Sarah's expense system**:

*Opportunity*: If the team builds strong user adoption, users might expand the system's use to new areas (benefits beyond the original scope).

*Enhancement strategy*:
- Invest in user training and change management (increase probability of adoption)
- Create user feedback channels and rapid response to feature requests (maintain momentum and goodwill)
- Pilot with influential user groups first; let them become advocates (increase probability of broader adoption)
- Document use cases and success stories to share across the organization (increase visibility and demand)

*Cost*: Additional change management resources, ongoing user engagement work

*Benefit*: Higher adoption, greater organizational benefit

## Risk Owners and Accountability

Every risk in your register needs a **risk owner**—a person accountable for monitoring the risk and executing the response strategy. Risk ownership is distinct from project management:

- **Project Manager**: Manages the overall project; ensures risk register is maintained; facilitates risk reviews
- **Risk Owners**: Own specific risks; monitor them; execute mitigation or contingency plans; report status

**How to assign risk owners**:
1. Match risk to someone with relevant authority and expertise
   - Technical risks → Technical lead
   - Schedule risks → Project manager or scheduler
   - Stakeholder/organizational risks → Sponsor or team lead
   - Vendor risks → Procurement manager

2. Ensure owners have enough information to do their job
   - They understand the risk and its impact
   - They know what response strategy is being pursued
   - They have authority to execute contingency plans

3. Make accountability clear
   - Risk owners report on risk status at reviews
   - They escalate if the risk situation changes
   - They execute response plans or escalate barriers

**Example from Sarah's office renovation**:

| Risk | Owner | Responsibility |
|------|-------|---|
| Permitting delays | Facilities Manager | Track permit status; engage permit office monthly; manage schedule buffer |
| Construction surprises | Contractor | Conduct pre-construction inspections; report findings; manage contingency work |
| Scope creep | Project Manager | Manage change requests; educate stakeholders on change process |
| Vendor performance | Procurement Manager | Monitor vendor quality; enforce contracts; manage vendor relationships |

Each owner reports on their risk at monthly project reviews.

## Contingency and Fallback Plans

Contingency plans bridge the gap between acceptance and avoidance. They acknowledge "we might have to deal with this" while planning in advance how we'll respond.

### Contingency Plans

A **contingency plan** is a pre-developed response to a risk if it occurs. Rather than being surprised and scrambling, you've thought through the response in advance.

**Elements of a contingency plan**:
1. **Trigger**: What signals that the risk has occurred?
   - Risk: Permit office doesn't respond within 30 days
   - Trigger: Day 31 without permit approval
2. **Response**: What specific actions will you take?
   - Escalate to city management
   - Request expedited review
   - Consider alternative design that requires fewer permits
3. **Responsible party**: Who executes the contingency plan?
   - Facilities Manager
4. **Timeline**: When will you activate the contingency?
   - Immediately upon trigger; response in 48 hours
5. **Cost**: How much will the contingency response cost?
   - Escalation is free; alternative design costs $5,000 in redesign work

**Example from Sarah's expense system**:

*Risk*: Technical integration issues discovered late in development

*Contingency plan*:
- **Trigger**: Integration testing reveals show-stopping compatibility issues
- **Response**:
  - Negotiate API customization with the cloud platform vendor (cost: $10,000-20,000)
  - Or, simplify the integrated features for initial release; plan Phase 2 enhancement (cost: delay to benefits, but no direct cost)
  - Or, reconsider the technical architecture and use an alternative platform (cost: 4-week delay)
- **Responsible party**: Technical lead in consultation with project manager
- **Timeline**: Decision within 1 week of trigger; execution plan developed immediately
- **Cost**: Budget $15,000 for contingency response (falls between the mitigation cost and the avoidance cost if alternatives are needed)

Contingency plans allow you to react quickly and deliberately rather than panicking.

### Fallback Plans

**Fallback plans** are responses to a risk if the primary response strategy fails.

For example:
- **Primary mitigation**: Early engagement with permit office to reduce delays
- **Fallback**: If early engagement doesn't work and delays occur, expedite the critical path by running later phases in parallel (increases cost but recovers schedule)

Fallback plans are less detailed than contingency plans but ensure you have options if the primary strategy doesn't work.

## Residual Risk and Contingency Reserves

No response strategy eliminates risk entirely. **Residual risk** is the risk remaining after response strategies are executed.

**Example**:
- *Original risk*: 40% probability of 4-week schedule delay
- *Mitigation*: Active permit office engagement (expected to reduce probability to 10%) + 2-week schedule buffer
- *Residual risk*: 10% probability of 2-week delay (less likely, and impact is less because of the buffer)

Residual risk is important because it must be addressed with contingency reserves.

### Contingency Reserves

**Contingency reserves** are budget or schedule buffers set aside to address risks that might occur.

There are two types:

1. **Specific contingency**: Allocated to specific identified risks
   - Example: $50,000 allocated to address "construction surprises" risk in the renovation
   - This is included in the cost baseline and is "authorized but not yet approved work"

2. **General contingency** (or **management reserve**): Held for unidentified risks or unknown unknowns
   - Example: 5% of project budget held in reserve for risks we haven't identified
   - This is not included in the cost baseline; it requires management approval to use

**How much contingency to reserve?**

Contingency depends on:
- **Project complexity**: More complex projects need more contingency (15-25% for predictive projects)
- **Organizational experience**: Mature organizations with historical data can estimate more precisely (10-15%); inexperienced organizations need more (25-35%)
- **Delivery approach**:
  - Predictive: Contingency is calculated during planning and reserved upfront
  - Agile: Contingency is implicit in velocity and velocity buffers; less formal calculation
  - Hybrid: Program-level contingency for strategic risks; team-level velocity buffers for delivery risks

**Example from Sarah's office renovation**:

- Base project cost: $500,000 (construction, materials, labor)
- Specific contingency (identified risks):
  - Construction surprises: $30,000 (high impact but low probability, conservative estimate)
  - Permit delays (schedule impact): $20,000 (covered in schedule buffer, not cost)
  - Material price inflation: $15,000
  - Total specific contingency: $65,000
- General contingency (for unknown risks): 5% × ($500,000 + $65,000) = $28,250
- **Cost baseline**: $500,000 + $65,000 = $565,000 (the plan)
- **Total budget**: $565,000 + $28,250 = $593,250 (budget including management reserve)

If no risks occur, the project comes in under budget. If identified risks do occur, specific contingency is available. If unexpected risks emerge, management reserve is available.

## Risk Response Across Delivery Approaches

### Predictive
- **Timing**: Response strategies developed during planning phase; documented in risk register
- **Approval**: Often reviewed by steering committee or change control board
- **Execution**: Formally tracked; contingency plans activated only when triggers occur
- **Documentation**: Detailed contingency and fallback plans for high-priority risks

*Example: Sarah's office renovation documents 8-10 contingency plans for major risks. When the permit delay occurs (as anticipated), she activates the contingency (escalation to city management) following the pre-planned response.*

### Agile
- **Timing**: Response strategies are implicit in the agile practices (retrospectives, definition of done, short iterations)
- **Approach**: Proactive avoidance through technical practices (test-driven development, continuous integration reduce technical risk); adaptive response through iterations
- **Documentation**: Lightweight; risks are tracked on the backlog or risk board
- **Contingency**: Limited formal contingency; the short iteration cycle allows rapid response when risks occur

*Example: In the expense system team's Definition of Done, they include "automated testing coverage >80%" (mitigation of quality risk). In retrospectives, they discuss what surprised them and adjust the next sprint (opportunity to respond to emerging risks). There's no formal contingency plan; the team adapts as needed.*

### Hybrid
- **Program level**: Predictive approach for strategic risks; detailed contingency plans for major risks
- **Team level**: Agile approach for delivery risks; embedded in team practices
- **Escalation**: Risks that cross thresholds or affect other initiatives escalate to program governance

*Example: Sarah's transformation program maintains formal contingency plans for organizational readiness risks (what if adoption is slower than expected?) at the program level. Individual teams manage technical and delivery risks adaptively within sprints. If a team's delivery risk threatens the program schedule, it escalates for program-level contingency response.*

## Key Takeaways

- **For threats**: Avoid (eliminate the risk), mitigate (reduce probability or impact), or accept (deal with it if it occurs)
- **For opportunities**: Exploit (actively pursue) or enhance (increase probability or impact)
- **Assign risk owners**: Each risk needs a person accountable for monitoring and response
- **Develop contingency plans**: For important risks, pre-plan how you'll respond if the risk occurs
- **Set aside contingency reserves**: Budget and schedule buffers address residual risk
- **Residual risk remains**: No response eliminates risk entirely; reserves are needed to address remaining uncertainty
- **Different delivery approaches use different response strategies**: Predictive uses detailed advance planning; agile uses adaptive response; hybrid uses both

## Reflection Questions

1. **Your risk responses**: For the risks you identified in the last section, what response strategy would you use for each? Why?

2. **Contingency reserves**: For a project you know well, how much contingency is allocated? Does it match the project's complexity and uncertainty?

3. **Risk ownership**: Who owns risks on your projects? Are they the right people? Do they have the authority and information to manage their risks?

4. **Opportunity mindset**: How much effort does your organization invest in identifying and exploiting opportunities vs. managing threats? What would it take to shift the balance?
