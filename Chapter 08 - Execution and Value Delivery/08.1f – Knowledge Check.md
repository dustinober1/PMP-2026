# 8.1f – Knowledge Check: Executing and Delivering Work

## Practice Questions

These questions test your understanding of project execution, quality management, scope control, and team performance.

---

### Question 1

**Domain**: Process (50%)
**ECO Task**: Manage project changes

A project team is halfway through a 6-month predictive project when a key stakeholder requests a significant change to the product design. The project manager analyzes the request and determines it will delay the schedule by 3 weeks and increase costs by $15,000.

**What should the project manager do NEXT?**

A) Implement the change to ensure stakeholder satisfaction.
B) Reject the change because it affects the baseline schedule and budget.
C) Submit a formal change request to the Change Control Board (CCB).
D) Ask the team to find a way to include the change without impacting the schedule.

**Answer: C**

**Explanation**:
In a predictive environment, significant changes to baselined scope, schedule, or cost must go through the formal change control process.
- **A is incorrect**: Implementing without approval is scope creep.
- **B is incorrect**: The PM analyzes and recommends, but the CCB (or sponsor) typically decides on significant changes.
- **D is incorrect**: Pressuring the team to "make it fit" leads to burnout and quality issues.

### Question 2

**Domain**: People (42%)
**ECO Task**: Support team performance

An agile team is consistently missing their sprint goals. In the retrospective, team members complain that they are constantly interrupted by requests from other departments for "quick fixes" and support.

**As a servant leader, what is the BEST action for the project manager?**

A) Tell the team to work harder to meet both the sprint goals and the support requests.
B) Shield the team from outside interruptions and direct all requests to the Product Owner.
C) Create a separate "support squad" within the team to handle interruptions.
D) Escalate the issue to the project sponsor.

**Answer: B**

**Explanation**:
A key role of the servant leader (or Scrum Master) is to remove impediments and shield the team from distractions so they can focus on their committed work.
- **A is incorrect**: This leads to burnout and ignores the root cause.
- **C is incorrect**: While a rotation strategy might work later, the immediate action is to stop the uncontrolled interruptions.
- **D is incorrect**: The PM/Scrum Master should try to resolve this first before escalating.

### Question 3

**Domain**: Process (50%)
**ECO Task**: Manage project quality

During a quality inspection of a construction project, the project manager discovers that the concrete used for the foundation does not meet the compressive strength specifications outlined in the quality management plan.

**What should the project manager do?**

A) Document the issue in the issue log and require rework.
B) Accept the lower strength concrete to avoid schedule delays.
C) Update the quality management plan to lower the standard.
D) Wait for the final inspection to see if it passes.

**Answer: A**

**Explanation**:
This is a defect (non-conformance to requirements). It must be documented and corrected (rework).
- **B is incorrect**: Accepting sub-standard work creates safety and liability risks.
- **C is incorrect**: You don't lower standards to hide defects.
- **D is incorrect**: Delaying the fix will likely make it much more expensive (e.g., if you build on top of it).

### Question 4

**Domain**: Process (50%)
**ECO Task**: Plan and manage procurement

A vendor on a critical path activity is reporting that they are 2 weeks behind schedule due to a supply chain shortage. The contract is a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract.

**What is the project manager's PRIMARY concern?**

A) The cost overrun for the vendor.
B) The impact on the project schedule.
C) Renegotiating the contract to Time and Materials.
D) Calculating the claim for liquidated damages immediately.

**Answer: B**

**Explanation**:
In an FFP contract, the vendor bears the cost risk, so the PM is less concerned about the vendor's profit margin (A). The PM's primary concern is the **schedule impact** to the project.
- **C is incorrect**: Changing contract type mid-stream is complex and usually unnecessary here.
- **D is incorrect**: While damages might apply, the *primary* focus is managing the schedule impact and finding a solution (partnership approach) before moving to penalties.

### Question 5

**Domain**: People (42%)
**ECO Task**: Build a team

A project manager notices that two highly skilled team members frequently argue during technical design sessions. These arguments are causing tension and delaying decisions.

**What conflict resolution technique should the project manager use initially?**

A) Smooth/Accommodate: Ask them to get along for the sake of the team.
B) Force/Direct: Choose one technical solution and order them to follow it.
C) Collaborate/Problem Solve: Facilitate a session to help them discuss the merits of each idea and reach a consensus.
D) Withdraw/Avoid: Let them work it out themselves.

**Answer: C**

**Explanation**:
Collaborate/Problem Solve is the best approach for technical disagreements because it seeks a win-win solution and leverages the expertise of both individuals. It addresses the root cause.
- **A is incorrect**: Smoothing ignores the real issue.
- **B is incorrect**: Forcing creates resentment and may miss the best technical solution.
- **D is incorrect**: While teams should self-organize, if it's causing delays and tension, the PM needs to facilitate.

## Domain Analysis

- **Process**: 3 questions (Change Control, Quality, Procurement)
- **People**: 2 questions (Servant Leadership, Conflict)

**Score Analysis**:
- **5/5**: Ready for execution scenarios.
- **3-4**: Review the specific gaps (e.g., Change Control vs. Agile adaptation).
- **0-2**: Re-read Chapter 8.1.
