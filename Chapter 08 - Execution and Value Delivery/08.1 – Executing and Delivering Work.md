# Chapter 13 – Executing and Delivering Work

## Introduction

The best plans in the world are meaningless unless they are executed effectively. Execution is where strategy meets reality, where team dynamics are tested, where vendor promises are validated, and where value is actually delivered. This is the phase where project managers earn their reputation—not by perfectly following a plan, but by adapting intelligently when reality inevitably deviates from expectations.

Execution is messy. Teams face unexpected challenges. Vendors miss deadlines. Requirements evolve. Quality issues emerge. Stakeholders change their minds. The project manager's role during execution is to maintain forward momentum while balancing competing demands: speed vs. quality, scope vs. schedule, autonomy vs. control, innovation vs. risk.

Different ways of working approach execution with different philosophies. Predictive projects emphasize disciplined adherence to the plan with formal change control. Agile projects embrace continuous adaptation with rapid feedback loops. Hybrid approaches balance structured governance with team-level flexibility. Understanding these differences is essential for the PMP exam and for real-world project success.

Sarah, our project manager, is now leading execution across three projects simultaneously:

- **Office Renovation (Predictive)**: Construction is underway. Vendors are on-site. Quality inspections are scheduled. The plan is detailed, but weather delays, material shortages, and coordination challenges are testing her ability to keep the project on track.

- **Expense System (Agile)**: The development team is delivering working software every two weeks. Stakeholders are engaged, providing rapid feedback. The Product Owner is balancing new feature requests with technical debt. The team is self-organizing, but Sarah must ensure quality standards are maintained and scope doesn't creep beyond the product vision.

- **Transformation Program (Hybrid)**: Multiple workstreams are executing in parallel. Some teams are following predictive schedules, others are working in sprints. Organizational resistance is surfacing. Change champions need support. Integration dependencies are becoming critical.

This chapter explores how Sarah navigates the complexities of execution across these three contexts, teaching the principles and practices that the PMP exam expects you to understand.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

1. **Coordinate team execution** across different ways of working, balancing structure with autonomy
2. **Manage quality proactively** during execution, using continuous assurance rather than end-phase testing
3. **Control scope** during execution, preventing scope creep while remaining responsive to legitimate changes
4. **Manage vendor performance** effectively, balancing contractual obligations with relationship building
5. **Drive team performance and accountability**, creating an environment where teams are motivated and empowered
6. **Adapt execution approaches** based on project context, stakeholder needs, and emerging risks
7. **Integrate execution activities** across multiple concurrent projects in a program or portfolio

## ECO Alignment

This chapter addresses the following tasks from the PMP Certification Exam Content Outline (ECO):

| Domain | Task | Coverage |
|--------|------|----------|
| Process | Task 3: Help Ensure Value-Based Delivery | Primary |

**How This Chapter Covers the ECO Task:**

Process Task 3 (Help Ensure Value-Based Delivery) requires you to:
- Understand how project work translates strategic plans into tangible deliverables
- Deliver value at multiple points throughout the project lifecycle, not just at the end
- Balance speed with quality and adaptability based on delivery approach
- Coordinate team execution to ensure value is created continuously
- Manage scope, quality, and performance during active work to maintain value delivery
- Support team members in understanding their contribution to organizational value

**Coverage in This Chapter:**

- **13a (Coordinating Team Execution)**: Explains how different delivery approaches (predictive, agile, hybrid) coordinate work to deliver value through different rhythms and governance mechanisms
- **13b (Quality Assurance and Testing)**: Shows how continuous quality assurance ensures that value delivered meets stakeholder expectations and organizational standards
- **13c (Managing Scope During Execution)**: Demonstrates how to protect and refine scope during execution so that delivered value remains aligned to what was promised
- **13d (Vendor and Procurement Management)**: Illustrates how vendor performance directly impacts the value delivered to the organization through reliable execution
- **13e (Team Performance and Accountability)**: Explores how team motivation, performance, and accountability drive the quality and speed of value delivery

Execution is where value-based delivery becomes reality. Through coordinating teams, maintaining quality, controlling scope, managing vendors, and sustaining team performance, project managers ensure that the work being done actually creates the value that was promised in the project charter and business case.

## Execution in Context: Predictive, Agile, and Hybrid

Before diving into specific execution topics, it's important to understand how execution philosophy differs across ways of working:

### Predictive Execution
- **Plan adherence**: The detailed project plan drives execution; deviations trigger formal change control
- **Phase gates**: Work progresses through defined phases with formal approval gates
- **Specialization**: Teams are often organized by function or discipline
- **Documentation**: Extensive documentation supports handoffs and knowledge transfer
- **Quality approach**: Testing and validation often occur at phase boundaries or project end
- **Coordination**: Formal status meetings, progress reports, and centralized control

**Example**: Sarah's Office Renovation follows a predictive approach. The construction schedule dictates daily work. Inspections occur at defined milestones. Vendors follow detailed specifications. Changes require formal approval and schedule/budget impact analysis.

### Agile Execution
- **Adaptive planning**: Work is planned in short iterations; priorities evolve based on feedback
- **Continuous delivery**: Working increments are delivered regularly, often every 1-4 weeks
- **Cross-functional teams**: Teams are self-organizing and have all skills needed to deliver value
- **Collaboration over documentation**: Face-to-face communication and working software over comprehensive docs
- **Quality approach**: Continuous testing, integration, and validation within each iteration
- **Coordination**: Daily standups, sprint planning, retrospectives, and continuous stakeholder engagement

**Example**: Sarah's Expense System uses Scrum. The team plans work in two-week sprints. They deliver working features each sprint. Quality is built in through test-driven development and continuous integration. The Product Owner adjusts priorities based on stakeholder feedback.

### Hybrid Execution
- **Layered governance**: Program-level predictive planning with team-level agile execution
- **Phase-gated with iterative delivery**: Major milestones follow a roadmap, but work within phases is iterative
- **Mixed team structures**: Some teams are functional, others are cross-functional
- **Tailored documentation**: Critical integration points require formal documentation; team-level work uses lightweight docs
- **Quality approach**: Quality standards set at program level, but validated continuously at team level
- **Coordination**: Program-level status reviews combined with team-level agile ceremonies

**Example**: Sarah's Transformation Program uses a hybrid approach. The program has defined phases (Assessment, Design, Implementation, Transition). But within each phase, teams work in sprints. Some workstreams (technology) are highly agile; others (policy changes) are more predictive.

## The Reality of Execution: Sarah's Week

To illustrate the complexity of execution, let's follow Sarah through a typical week:

**Monday Morning – Office Renovation**
Sarah arrives at the construction site for the weekly coordination meeting. The electrical contractor reports a two-day delay due to material shortages. The HVAC team is ready to start but can't until electrical rough-in is complete. Sarah must decide: authorize overtime to catch up, compress the schedule elsewhere, or formally change the project timeline.

**Monday Afternoon – Expense System**
Sarah joins the sprint planning meeting. The Product Owner wants to add a new reporting feature that wasn't in the original product backlog. The development team estimates it's a three-sprint effort. But the current sprint goals already fill the team's capacity. Sarah facilitates a conversation: Is this truly a priority? What gets deferred? How does this align with the product roadmap?

**Tuesday Morning – Transformation Program**
Sarah reviews the program dashboard. Three workstreams are green, two are yellow, one is red. The red workstream (Change Management) is behind schedule because regional leaders haven't identified change champions. Sarah escalates to the program sponsor and schedules stakeholder interviews to understand the resistance.

**Wednesday – Quality Issues**
Sarah receives a quality report from the Office Renovation showing that some framing work doesn't meet code. It must be redone, causing a three-day delay and $12,000 in rework costs. She immediately calls the contractor to discuss root cause and prevention measures.

Meanwhile, the Expense System team reports that automated tests are failing due to a recent code change. The team catches it before the sprint demo, preventing a potential defect from reaching stakeholders. Sarah recognizes the team's quality discipline in the retrospective.

**Thursday – Vendor Escalation**
The furniture vendor for the Office Renovation notifies Sarah that lead times have extended from six weeks to ten weeks due to supply chain disruptions. This jeopardizes the project's completion date. Sarah negotiates expedited delivery for critical items and authorizes a change order for the remaining items.

**Friday – Team Morale**
Sarah notices that the Transformation Program's technology team seems burned out. They've been working long hours to meet an aggressive integration deadline. She talks with the team lead and learns that unclear requirements from the business team are causing rework. Sarah facilitates a working session between business and technology to clarify requirements and prevent further waste.

This week illustrates the core execution challenges covered in this chapter:
- **Coordination**: Keeping multiple teams and vendors synchronized
- **Quality**: Detecting and preventing defects proactively
- **Scope**: Managing change requests and scope creep
- **Vendor management**: Balancing contractual expectations with relationship building
- **Team performance**: Sustaining motivation and addressing morale issues

## Integration Across Chapter Sections

While each section of this chapter focuses on a specific aspect of execution, these elements are deeply interconnected:

- **Coordination enables quality**: Well-coordinated teams have fewer integration defects
- **Quality impacts scope**: Quality issues often trigger scope changes or rework
- **Vendor performance affects coordination**: Delayed vendors disrupt team schedules
- **Team morale influences quality**: Burned-out teams make more mistakes
- **Scope creep undermines accountability**: Constant scope changes make it impossible to measure progress

Sarah's success depends on seeing these connections and managing execution holistically, not as isolated activities.

## How This Chapter Connects to Previous Chapters

Execution builds directly on the foundation established in earlier chapters:

- **Chapter 6 (Building and Leading Teams)**: The team development work pays off during execution when teams self-organize and solve problems
- **Chapter 7 (Stakeholder and Communication Mastery)**: Effective stakeholder communication during execution prevents surprises and manages expectations
- **Chapter 9 (Coaching, Mentoring, and Servant Leadership)**: Servant leadership principles guide how Sarah supports teams during execution challenges
- **Chapter 10 (Initiating and Planning)**: The project charter and delivery approach selected during initiation shape execution philosophy
- **Chapter 11 (Planning for Value Delivery)**: The detailed plans become the baseline against which execution is measured
- **Chapter 12 (Risk, Issues, and Change Management)**: Execution reveals risks, generates issues, and triggers changes

This chapter focuses on the day-to-day reality of delivering value. The next chapter (Chapter 14 – Monitoring, Controlling, and Closing) will explore how to track progress, control variances, and formally close projects.

## Key Execution Principles

Before diving into the detailed sections, keep these principles in mind:

1. **Plans are guides, not guarantees**: Even the best plan will require adaptation during execution
2. **Early detection prevents late disasters**: Proactive monitoring catches problems when they're small
3. **Quality cannot be inspected in**: It must be built into the process from the beginning
4. **Trust, but verify**: Empower teams, but maintain appropriate oversight
5. **Relationships matter as much as contracts**: Vendor performance improves with partnership
6. **Transparency builds confidence**: Honest communication about challenges builds stakeholder trust
7. **Morale is a leading indicator**: Team burnout predicts quality and schedule problems
8. **Context determines approach**: Predictive, agile, and hybrid require different execution disciplines

Sarah learns these principles through experience across her three projects. Some lessons come from successes, others from failures. But each lesson makes her a more effective project manager.

## Moving Forward

The following sections provide detailed guidance on each aspect of execution. As you study each section, consider:

- How would you handle these situations in your own projects?
- What are the differences between predictive, agile, and hybrid approaches?
- How do PMI's principles guide decision-making during execution?
- What are the integration points between different execution activities?

Execution is where project managers prove their value. It's where theoretical knowledge meets practical reality. Master these execution principles, and you'll not only pass the PMP exam—you'll deliver successful projects.
