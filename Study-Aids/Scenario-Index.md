# Scenario Index

## Overview

This PMP study guide uses three consistent scenarios throughout all chapters to illustrate project management concepts across different delivery approaches. These scenarios provide concrete examples of how theoretical concepts apply in real-world situations, helping readers understand the practical application of project management principles.

The three scenarios represent the spectrum of project management approaches:
- **Office Renovation** (Predictive/Waterfall approach)
- **Expense System** (Agile approach) 
- **Transformation Program** (Hybrid approach)

Each scenario is led by Sarah, our project manager, who demonstrates how project management practices adapt to different contexts, stakeholder needs, and organizational environments.
