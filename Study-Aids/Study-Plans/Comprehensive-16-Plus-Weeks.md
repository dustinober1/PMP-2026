## Must-Memorize Reference Guide

### Critical Formulas

#### Earned Value Management
- **CPI** = EV / AC (>1 = under budget, <1 = over budget)
- **SPI** = EV / PV (>1 = ahead of schedule, <1 = behind schedule)
- **CV** = EV - AC (positive = under budget, negative = over budget)
- **SV** = EV - PV (positive = ahead of schedule, negative = behind schedule)
- **EAC** = BAC / CPI (assumes current performance continues)
- **EAC** = AC + (BAC - EV) (assumes future work at planned rate)
- **EAC** = AC + Bottom-up ETC (new estimate for remaining work)
- **ETC** = EAC - AC
- **VAC** = BAC - EAC (positive = under final budget, negative = over final budget)
- **TCPI** = (BAC - EV) / (BAC - AC) [to meet original budget]
- **TCPI** = (BAC - EV) / (EAC - AC) [to meet revised budget]

#### Other Key Formulas
- **Communication Channels** = n(n-1)/2 where n = number of people
- **Three-Point Estimate** = (Optimistic + 4×Most Likely + Pessimistic) / 6
- **Standard Deviation** = (Pessimistic - Optimistic) / 6

### Framework Acronyms

#### ADKAR Change Model
- **A**wareness of the need for change
- **D**esire to participate and support the change

2. **Compromise** - Both parties give something up, lose-lose
3. **Smooth** (Accommodate) - Emphasize agreement, de-emphasize differences
4. **Force** (Direct) - Win-lose, use when quick decision needed
5. **Avoid** (Withdraw) - Postpone or ignore, worst option

#### Risk Response Strategies
**For Threats (Negative Risks)**:
- **Avoid** - Eliminate the threat entirely
- **Mitigate** - Reduce probability or impact
- **Transfer** - Shift risk to third party (insurance, outsourcing)
- **Accept** - Acknowledge but don't act (active: reserve; passive: do nothing)

### Agile Manifesto

#### Four Values
1. **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
2. **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
3. **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
4. **Responding to change** over following a plan
