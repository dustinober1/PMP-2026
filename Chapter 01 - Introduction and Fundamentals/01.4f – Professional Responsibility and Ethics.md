## 1.4f – Professional Responsibility and Ethics: Doing the Right Thing

Sarah realizes: *Project management is not just about delivering on time and on budget. It is about doing the right thing for all stakeholders.*

PMI's Code of Conduct outlines four values:

1. **Responsibility**: Own your decisions and actions. Be accountable for results.
2. **Respect**: Acknowledge and value the contributions of team members, stakeholders, and others.
3. **Fairness**: Make decisions impartially, based on merit and facts.
4. **Honesty**: Communicate truthfully and maintain integrity.

### 1.4f.1 Responsibility: Owning Your Decisions

Sarah faces a situation: The office project is behind schedule. The sponsor asks: *"Can we make up time by reducing quality checks?"*

Sarah could say: "Sure, if that is what you want."

But Sarah's responsibility is to:

1. **Be honest about the consequences**: "If we skip quality checks, we risk defects that are expensive to fix later. Cost of fixing defects now: $50K. Cost of fixing them after turnover: $500K. Regulatory risk if defects are found: Potential liability."

2. **Offer options**: "Here are three ways to recover schedule: (1) Add resources (overtime, contractors). (2) Reduce scope (some finishes are deferred to Phase 2). (3) Slip the deadline. Each has trade-offs."

3. **Own the recommendation**: "Based on the risks and business impact, I recommend Option 2: reduce scope. Here is what gets deferred."

4. **Take accountability**: "If we proceed with skipping quality checks, I need to document that decision. If problems occur, I want it clear that this was a conscious trade-off, not an oversight."

**Responsibility means:** Do not just do what the sponsor says if you believe it is wrong. Raise the concern, offer alternatives, make recommendations. Then, if the sponsor chooses to proceed, document it and support the decision (assuming it is not illegal or unethical).

### 1.4f.2 Respect: Valuing Others' Contributions

Sarah manages a diverse team. She notices:

- A junior developer has a good idea but is hesitant to speak up in meetings
- A team member from a non-technical background has a different perspective on the requirements
- A person with a disability asks for accommodations
- A team member is working long hours and looks stressed

Sarah's responsibility:

1. **Create psychological safety**: Make it clear that diverse perspectives are valued. "That is a good observation. Let's explore that idea further."

2. **Actively solicit input**: "I want to hear from everyone, especially those who have not spoken yet. What are your thoughts?"

3. **Honor accommodations**: "What support do you need to do your best work?"

4. **Recognize burnout**: "You have been working a lot of late hours. That is not sustainable. Let's talk about workload."

5. **Acknowledge contributions**: "This would not have worked without your effort. Thank you."

**Respect means:** Treat team members and stakeholders as people, not resources. Recognize their contributions, listen to their perspectives, and create an environment where they can do their best work.

### 1.4f.3 Fairness: Making Impartial Decisions

Sarah must make a difficult decision: A team member has been underperforming. Should they stay on the team for the next phase?

Sarah's responsibility:

1. **Use merit and facts, not bias**: "Is this person underperforming because they lack capability, effort, or support? Or because I have a bias against them?"

2. **Be transparent about decision criteria**: "Here are the criteria for staying on the team: (1) Ability to deliver quality work, (2) Ability to work with the team, (3) Alignment with project needs."

3. **Give feedback and opportunity**: "You have been missing deadlines. Here is what I observe. Here is what I need to see improve. Here is support I can offer."

4. **Make the decision on merit**: If the person cannot meet the criteria despite support, the decision is based on facts, not personality.

5. **Handle it professionally**: "Based on project needs and performance, the team for Phase 2 will be [list]. I appreciated your contributions in Phase 1. Here are some growth areas for your next project."

**Fairness means:** Make decisions based on facts and merit, not on personal preferences, bias, or favoritism. Treat all people impartially according to the same standards.

### 1.4f.4 Honesty: Truthful Communication

Sarah faces pressure: The CEO wants to know if the office renovation will hit the move-in date. Sarah knows that based on current progress, the project will be 4–6 weeks late.

Sarah's responsibility:

1. **Be honest**: "Based on current progress and schedule trends, I forecast a 4–6 week delay. That means moving in around late Month 22 instead of Month 18."

2. **Provide context**: "The delay is primarily due to unforeseen site conditions and permitting delays, not mismanagement. We have taken mitigation steps [list]. The delay could have been longer without those actions."

3. **Do not sugar-coat**: Do not say "we are on track" if you are not. Do not promise to make up time unless you are confident you can.

4. **Offer options**: "Here are our options: (1) Accept the 4–6 week delay. (2) Accelerate with additional resources at additional cost ($X). (3) Reduce scope and hit the original date (scope would be [list])."

5. **Update regularly**: As circumstances change, update the forecast. "Last month I said 4–6 weeks late. This month, based on new information, I now forecast 6–8 weeks late. Here is why."

**Honesty means:** Tell the truth, even when it is uncomfortable. Do not hide problems or overpromise. Give stakeholders the information they need to make good decisions.

### 1.4f.5 Conflict of Interest

Sarah encounters a situation: She is considering hiring a contractor for the next project. The contractor is also a personal friend.

Conflict of interest: Sarah's personal relationship could bias her toward hiring the friend, even if they are not the best choice.

Sarah's responsibility:

1. **Disclose the relationship**: "I want to note that I know this contractor personally. I want to ensure we make the best decision for the project, so I am disclosing this potential conflict."

2. **Recuse yourself if necessary**: "Given the conflict, someone else should lead the vendor evaluation. Here is [colleague name]. They will make the decision on merit."

3. **If you stay involved, be extra careful**: Document the decision criteria, follow them strictly, do not give the friend preferential treatment.

### 1.4f.6 Confidentiality and Information Security

Sarah has access to confidential information:

- Employee salary and performance data (while managing the transformation)
- Competitive information (the company is considering a partnership with a competitor)
- Proprietary technology (the AI models the company is building)

Sarah's responsibility:

1. **Do not share confidential information** without permission, even with trusted friends or colleagues outside the project
2. **Secure information appropriately**: Do not leave sensitive documents on public desks, emails sent to wrong recipients, or files on unsecured devices
3. **Access only what you need**: Do not look at information that is not relevant to your role
4. **When the project ends**, return or securely destroy confidential information

### 1.4f.7 Continuous Learning and Professional Development

Sarah realizes: The project management profession is evolving. AI is new. Agile practices are spreading. Organizational structures are changing.

Sarah's responsibility:

1. **Stay current**: Read about new practices, take courses, attend conferences
2. **Admit knowledge gaps**: "I have not done this before. Let me learn or bring in someone who knows."
3. **Share knowledge**: Help less experienced PMs learn from your experience
4. **Reflect and improve**: After each project, reflect on what worked and what did not. Improve your practice.

### 1.4f.8 Speaking Up: The Courage to Challenge

Sarah faces her toughest ethical situation:

She discovers that a vendor is cutting corners on the office renovation. Materials are substandard; work does not meet spec. The contractor is not reporting it.

Sarah could:

A) Ignore it and hope no one notices
B) Tell the contractor to shape up but keep it quiet
C) Speak up to the project sponsor

Sarah chooses C. Her responsibility:

1. **Gather facts**: Document what you observe (materials that do not match spec, work that does not meet standards)
2. **Raise it**: "I have observed [specific issues]. These do not meet the specifications and could create problems. We need to address this."
3. **Escalate if necessary**: If the contractor does not fix it, escalate to the sponsor or change control board
4. **Document**: Keep records of what you raised, when, and what happened

**This takes courage.** Speaking up can create conflict, put relationships at risk, and be uncomfortable. But it is the ethical thing to do.

### 1.4f.9 On the Exam: Ethics Scenarios

Exam questions test ethics and professional responsibility by presenting dilemmas and asking you to choose the ethical response.

**Common question patterns:**

- *"You discover a team member is struggling with something, but you have not been asked to help. Should you speak up?"*
- *"Your sponsor is asking you to skip a quality step to save cost. How do you respond?"*
- *"You have a conflict of interest in a decision. What should you do?"*
- *"You are asked to do something that you believe is unethical. What do you do?"*

**Red flag answers:**

- "Just do what the sponsor asks without questioning"
- "Ignore the problem and hope it goes away"
- "Do not disclose the conflict of interest"
- "Keep confidential information private unless you get in trouble"

**Good answers:**

- Honestly assess the situation and the ethical issues
- Raise your concern to the appropriate person
- Offer options and recommendations
- Document the situation (what you observed, what you reported, what happened)
- If the organization does not address the ethics concern, escalate (HR, ethics hotline, or in extreme cases, whistleblower channels)
- Act in the best interest of the project and all stakeholders, not just yourself

### 1.4g – Knowledge Check

1.  **Stakeholder Engagement:** A key stakeholder is consistently absent from meetings and unresponsive to emails. This stakeholder has high power and high interest. What is the best initial action?
    *   A) Escalate to the project sponsor.
    *   B) Mark them as "supportive" in the stakeholder register.
    *   C) Schedule a 1:1 meeting to understand their communication preferences and constraints.
    *   D) Send a formal letter documenting their lack of engagement.

2.  **Ways of Working:** A team is building a new product with highly uncertain requirements. The customer wants to see progress every two weeks. Which approach is most suitable?
    *   A) Predictive (Waterfall)
    *   B) Agile (Adaptive)
    *   C) Hybrid
    *   D) Phased Gate

3.  **Triple Constraint:** A project is behind schedule. The sponsor insists on hitting the original deadline but refuses to approve overtime or additional resources. What is the most realistic trade-off?
    *   A) Improve quality to reduce rework.
    *   B) Reduce scope.
    *   C) Crash the schedule.
    *   D) Fast-track the schedule (which increases risk).

4.  **Data-Informed Decision-Making:** Your project has a CPI of 0.85 and an SPI of 1.10. What does this tell you?
    *   A) Over budget and ahead of schedule.
    *   B) Under budget and ahead of schedule.
    *   C) Over budget and behind schedule.
    *   D) Under budget and behind schedule.

5.  **Ethics:** You discover a significant error in a cost estimate that you already presented to the client. Correcting it will reduce your project's profit margin. What should you do?
    *   A) Fix it quietly in the execution phase.
    *   B) Inform the client immediately and present the corrected estimate.
    *   C) Ignore it and hope the contingency reserve covers it.
    *   D) Ask your manager for permission to disclose it.

**Answers:**
1.  **C** - Direct engagement to understand the root cause is the first step.
2.  **B** - High uncertainty + frequent feedback = Agile.
3.  **B** - If time and cost (resources) are fixed, scope is the remaining flexible constraint.
4.  **A** - CPI < 1.0 is over budget; SPI > 1.0 is ahead of schedule.
5.  **B** - Honesty and transparency are core ethical obligations.
