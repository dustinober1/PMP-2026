## 1.4c – Quality: Ensuring Your Deliverables Actually Solve the Problem

Sarah realizes: *A project can come in on time and on budget and still fail if the deliverable does not actually work or does not solve the real problem.*

### 5.3.1 What Is Quality?

Quality has two classic definitions:

1. **Conformance to requirements**: Does the deliverable meet the stated requirements?
   - *Example (office)*: Does the office have the specified square footage? Is the layout as designed? Are materials the specified grade?
   - *Example (expense system)*: Does the receipt upload feature work as specified? Does cost center suggestion work?

2. **Fitness for use**: Does the deliverable actually solve the customer's problem and meet their needs?
   - *Example (office)*: Is the office actually a good place to work? Do teams collaborate effectively? Is it comfortable and productive?
   - *Example (expense system)*: Do people actually use it? Does it reduce submission errors and time? Are people happy with it?

**Sarah learns: You need both.**

- If you focus only on conformance to requirements, you might build something that meets the spec but does not actually work or satisfy users (office with right square footage but terrible layout; expense system with all required features but unusable interface)
- If you focus only on fitness for use, you might miss critical requirements (office without required safety features; expense system without required audit trail)

### 5.3.2 Quality in Predictive Contexts

In the office renovation project, quality is managed through:

1. **Detailed specifications**: The scope statement and plans specify exactly what materials, finishes, and systems are required
2. **Acceptance criteria**: For each major deliverable, define what "done" means
   - *Example*: Electrical work is accepted when: inspected by city inspector, meets NEC code, all circuits tested and functioning, no exposed wiring
3. **Inspections and testing**: As work is completed, inspect it against the spec
   - City inspector signs off on foundation
   - Electrical contractor performs circuit testing
   - Contractor walks the space with facilities team before turnover
4. **Quality standards and best practices**: Industry standards apply (building codes, ADA requirements)
5. **Defect management**: When issues are found (cracked concrete, non-functional outlet), they are documented, prioritized, and corrected before acceptance

**Sarah's quality process:**

- Preventive: Clear specs minimize rework
- Detective: Inspections catch issues early
- Corrective: Issues are fixed before acceptance
- Acceptance: Sign-off only happens when quality criteria are met

### 5.3.3 Quality in Agile Contexts

In the expense system project, quality is managed through:

1. **Definition of Done**: The team defines what "done" means for each feature
   - Code is written, reviewed, and approved
   - Feature is tested (automated tests and manual testing)
   - No known bugs
   - Deployed to staging environment
   - Product owner has accepted it

2. **Continuous quality practices**:
   - Daily code reviews: developers check each other's code before it is merged
   - Automated testing: tests run every time code is committed, catching regressions
   - Pair programming: two developers work together, reducing errors
   - Frequent releases: every 2 weeks, code goes to production, where real users test it

3. **User feedback as quality signal**: Users provide feedback in sprint reviews
   - If users say a feature does not work as expected, the team fixes it
   - If a feature does not solve the real problem, it gets de-prioritized or redesigned

4. **Continuous improvement**: Retrospectives identify quality issues
   - "We had more bugs this sprint because we were rushed"
   - "We need better testing practices"
   - The team adjusts its process the next sprint

**Sarah's quality in the agile project:**

- Prevention: Definition of done prevents incomplete work
- Detection: Continuous testing and user feedback catch issues quickly
- Correction: Issues are fixed in the current or next sprint
- Feedback: Users say "this does not work the way I expected," and the team adapts

### 5.3.4 Quality and Value: The Real Question

Sarah encounters a subtle issue: *What if the deliverable meets the spec but does not deliver value?*

**Example from the office renovation:**

The spec says "conference room with AV system." The team builds a conference room with a projector and speakers—conforming to the spec. But in reality, teams never use the room because the AV system is complicated, no one knows how to use it, and the room is hard to book. The space does not deliver value (collaboration benefit) even though it meets the spec.

**Example from the expense system:**

The feature delivers "automatic cost center suggestions." It works perfectly—conforming to spec. But it suggests wrong categories so often that users ignore it and still type manually. The feature does not deliver value (reduced data entry time).

**Sarah learns: Quality for the sake of quality is not enough. The deliverable must deliver value.**

This means:

- Engage users in understanding what quality means to them
- Test not just whether the feature works technically, but whether it solves the real problem
- Be willing to change a feature (even if it meets the spec) if users tell you it is not delivering value
- Measure quality not just by conformance to requirements, but by outcomes: Are people using it? Is it achieving the business benefits?

### 5.3.5 Quality Trade-offs

Sarah sometimes faces a choice: deliver a feature fully on time, or deliver it partially with better quality.

**Thinking about quality trade-offs:**

- **Schedule vs. Quality**: If you rush, quality suffers. Bugs appear later, rework happens, customers are unhappy.
  - But sometimes rushing is the right choice if time-to-value matters more (e.g., a critical feature in a competitive market)
  - The key: Make the trade-off consciously, understand the long-term costs (technical debt, support costs), and plan to address quality later if needed

- **Scope vs. Quality**: If you try to do too much, quality suffers.
  - If you pare back scope to maintain quality, you deliver fewer features but they work well
  - Example (expense system): Sarah could try to deliver all 50 backlog items in 6 sprints, rushing quality. Or deliver 40 items with high quality. She chooses the latter.

- **Cost vs. Quality**: If you cut costs (fewer testers, cheaper materials), quality often suffers.
  - Sometimes this is the right trade-off (internal tool, low risk)
  - Sometimes it is the wrong trade-off (customer-facing product, safety-critical system)
  - The key: Understand the consequences

### 5.3.6 Organizational Standards and Compliance

Sarah learns that quality is not just about the project; it is also about organizational standards, industry standards, and regulatory compliance.

- **Organizational standards**: The company may have policies on code style, testing requirements, documentation, security
- **Industry standards**: Building codes, electrical codes, healthcare regulations, financial regulations, environmental standards
- **Regulatory compliance**: Some projects must meet legal requirements or face fines/liability

**In the office renovation:**

- Building codes (foundation strength, electrical safety, fire safety, ADA accessibility)
- Environmental standards (energy efficiency, sustainable materials)
- Organizational standards (brand aesthetic, technology infrastructure standards)
- If standards are not met, the city will not sign off on the building

**In the expense system:**

- Organizational standards (data security, password requirements, audit trail)
- Financial standards (expense policies, approval requirements)
- If data is not secure, the company faces legal liability
- If there is no audit trail, the company cannot verify expenses

**Sarah learns: Quality includes meeting standards and compliance, not just meeting user expectations.**

### 5.3.7 On the Exam: Quality Scenarios

Exam questions test quality thinking by presenting scenarios where quality could be compromised.

**Common question patterns:**

- *"The team is behind schedule. A team member suggests cutting corners on testing to make up time. What should you do?"*
- *"The client approved the feature, but your team discovered it does not work well in production. What do you do?"*
- *"The deliverable meets the spec, but users say it does not solve their real problem. How do you respond?"*

**Red flag answers:**

- "Skip quality practices to save time"
- "Deliver something you know is not working and hope no one notices"
- "Blame the user for not being clear about requirements"
- "Let quality problems go to production to save costs"

**Good answers:**

- Identify the root cause of the quality issue
- Understand the business impact (Are users unable to work? Is the company at legal risk?)
- Make a conscious decision about how to address it
- Plan for rework or corrections
- If cutting quality is the choice, understand and communicate the long-term costs
- Adjust the process to prevent similar issues in the future
