# 10.3b – Practice Exam 1 Answers

### Question 1
**Answer: C**
*   **Explanation**: In Agile, the team is self-organizing, but the Scrum Master/PM is responsible for the *process*. A standup is for quick status synchronization (15 mins max), not deep technical problem-solving. The best action is to facilitate the process by moving the detailed discussion to a "parking lot" or sidebar meeting so the standup can finish. (A) violates self-organization. (B) allows the meeting to derail. (D) is too drastic.

### Question 2
**Answer: C**
*   **Explanation**: In a predictive environment, scope is baselined. Any addition—even a small one—must go through Integrated Change Control. You cannot just "do it" (B) or "reject it" (A) without analyzing the impact. The correct process is to analyze the impact (Create a Change Request) and present it to the decision-maker (Sponsor/CCB). Even if the Sponsor said "no budget," the formal step is to document the request and impact.

### Question 3
**Answer: B**
*   **Explanation**: This addresses **Business Environment Task 3: Evaluate external changes**. A strategic shift is a major business environment change. The PM's job is to align with strategy. You shouldn't just ignore it (A) or blindly halt work (C). You must analyze the trade-off (Delay vs. Strategic Alignment) and present the data (Business Case) to the Governance Board for a decision.

### Question 4
**Answer: B**
*   **Explanation**: This addresses **People Task 1: Manage conflict / Support team performance**. Always start with curiosity and empathy ("Servant Leadership"). There may be a valid reason for the behavior (health, family, burnout). (A) is punitive and premature. (C) and (D) assume the cause without investigating.

### Question 5
**Answer: D**
*   **Explanation**: This is a **Process** question about Schedule Management in a Hybrid context. When a dependency slips, the first step is **Analysis**. You don't just spend money (A) or stop work (C) immediately. You evaluate the impact and options (like expediting or workarounds), and *then* follow the change control process if the baseline is impacted.

### Question 6
**Answer: B**
*   **Explanation**: **PMI Code of Ethics**. PMPs must adhere to the laws of the country where work is performed *AND* their own ethical standards. However, "facilitation fees" (bribes) are generally strictly prohibited by the PMI Code of Ethics and often by the FCPA/UK Bribery Act which apply extraterritorially. Even if "customary," it is an ethical violation. The PMP answer is to refuse bribery.

### Question 7
**Answer: C**
*   **Explanation**: **People / Virtual Teams**. Fairness and inclusivity are key. Rotational meeting times are the standard best practice for global teams to share the burden of "off-hours" meetings. (A) is exclusive. (B) reduces communication richness. (D) isolates the Asia team.

### Question 8
**Answer: B**
*   **Explanation**: **Agile Process**. The Sprint Backlog is owned by the team and should be protected from change during the sprint to ensure focus and predictability. New requests belong in the *Product* Backlog for future prioritization. (A) causes chaos. (C) violates sustainable pace. (D) is a negotiation that might happen, but B is the standard rule.

### Question 9
**Answer: B**
*   **Explanation**: **Business Environment / Ethics**. PMPs have a responsibility to the public and society. Launching a biased AI tool carries significant ethical, reputational, and potentially legal risks. The PM must prioritize ethics and long-term value over the immediate schedule.

### Question 10
**Answer: B**
*   **Explanation**: **Process / Quality**. When a defect rate is high, you must solve the *root cause*, not just fix the symptoms. Fishbone (Ishikawa) diagrams are the tool for this. (A) is waste without learning. (C) is "lowering the bar," which is poor quality management.

### Question 11
**Answer: A**
*   **Explanation**: **People / Agile Mindset**. In Agile, teams "pull" work; managers (or peers) don't "push" (assign) work. John is violating this norm. The best approach is private coaching to help him adjust to the team's way of working. (B) is public shaming. (D) is premature.

### Question 12
**Answer: D**
*   **Explanation**: **Process / Risk**. **Revised Answer: D**. Organizing a facilitated workshop is a proactive process step to clear the requirements bottleneck. It attempts to solve the problem through engagement before escalating (C).

### Question 13
**Answer: C**
*   **Explanation**: **Business Environment / Benefits**. If the business case is invalid, the project should not continue *in its current form*. The PM must re-evaluate the value proposition. (A) is a decision for the Sponsor, not the PM. (B) is the "Sunk Cost Fallacy."

### Question 14
**Answer: C**
*   **Explanation**: **Process / Agile**. Unstable velocity is a symptom of an underlying problem (blockers, poor stories, changing scope). The Retrospective is the place to diagnose and fix the process. (D) Mandating velocity is impossible (it's an observation, not a setting).

### Question 15
**Answer: C**
*   **Explanation**: **Process / Risk Decision**. This is a trade-off. There is no single "right" answer without stakeholder input. The PM's job is to facilitate the decision based on data: "Here is the risk of the bug vs. the risk of the patch." Stakeholders (Business + Tech) must decide.

### Question 16
**Answer: A**
*   **Explanation**: **Process / Integration**. The Project Charter formally authorizes the project and gives the Project Manager the authority to apply organizational resources. Without a signature, the project is not officially authorized.

### Question 17
**Answer: D**
*   **Explanation**: **People / Inclusivity**. All of these are valid tactics. Setting ground rules (A), coaching individuals (B), and using structural tools (C) are all parts of creating an inclusive environment.

### Question 18
**Answer: C**
*   **Explanation**: **Process / Agile (Kanban)**. In Kanban, you focus on flow and relieving bottlenecks. If Testing is blocked, the whole team (including developers) should "swarm" to clear the blockage. Starting new work (A) just increases WIP and makes the bottleneck worse.

### Question 19
**Answer: C**
*   **Explanation**: **Business Environment / Governance**. Projects must adhere to organizational governance. If the finance model changes, the PM must adapt the plan (Cost Management Plan) and communicate it. Refusing (A) is not an option.

### Question 20
**Answer: C**
*   **Explanation**: **People / Resource Management**. Functional managers own resources in matrix organizations. The PM needs to negotiate. (B) is escalating too fast. (C) is the constructive problem-solving approach.

### Question 21
**Answer: C**
*   **Explanation**: **Process / Risk**. Insurance is the classic example of **Transference**. You shift the financial impact of the risk to a third party (the insurance company).

### Question 22
**Answer: B**
*   **Explanation**: **Business Environment / Compliance**. Regulatory compliance is non-negotiable. It is a "Constraint." The PM must educate the PO that this cannot be deprioritized like a feature. It creates legal risk.

### Question 23
**Answer: B**
*   **Explanation**: **People / Agile Roles**. The PM/Scrum Master is a coach. If the PO is not fulfilling their role, the PM must coach them on the impact of their absence. Taking over (A) is a conflict of interest.

### Question 24
**Answer: B**
*   **Explanation**: **Process / Closing**. The final administrative step is archiving records and updating OPAs (Lessons Learned, historical data) so the organization can learn. Releasing the team (A) happens, but archiving is the formal "closing" of the project records.

### Question 25
**Answer: B**
*   **Explanation**: **Business Environment / Strategic Alignment**. The project is delivering the output, but the output is useless for the strategic market. This is a misalignment. It must be raised to the Governance Board for a decision (e.g., approve more funds). Hiding it (D) is unethical.

### Question 26
**Answer: B**
*   **Explanation**: **People / Conflict**. If a conflict is unresolvable and affecting the project, the PM must protect the project and the team. Separating the parties (moving one) is a valid resolution strategy when collaboration fails.

### Question 27
**Answer: C**
*   **Explanation**: **Process / Agile**. Story Points are relative. Converting them to hours defeats the purpose (and accuracy) of points. The PM should explain the *value* of the current metric (predictability/velocity) rather than giving false precision with hours.

### Question 28
**Answer: B**
*   **Explanation**: **Business Environment / Ethics**. Child labor is a severe human rights violation and typically a violation of strict corporate governance/ESG policies. The ethical imperative and compliance requirement outweigh the schedule delay.

### Question 29
**Answer: B**
*   **Explanation**: **People / Tuckman Model**. In the "Forming" stage, the team needs direction and structure to establish safety and norms. The leader acts as a facilitator to help them connect and agree on how to work (Working Agreements).

### Question 30
**Answer: B**
*   **Explanation**: **Process / Schedule**. A "Lag" is a waiting time between two tasks (Finish-to-Start + 3 days lag).

### Question 31
**Answer: B**
*   **Explanation**: **Business Environment / Value**. Sunk costs (money spent) should not influence future decisions. If the Cost to Finish ($2M) is greater than the Value ($1M), the project has a negative ROI going forward. A responsible PM recommends termination.

### Question 32
**Answer: C**
*   **Explanation**: **People / Agile Roles**. This is a coaching opportunity. The team needs to learn to say "no" (or "talk to the PO"), and the stakeholder needs to learn the process. The PM facilitates this understanding.

### Question 33
**Answer: B**
*   **Explanation**: **Process / Planning**. Rolling Wave Planning is an iterative planning technique where near-term work is planned in detail and future work is planned at a high level.

### Question 34
**Answer: C**
*   **Explanation**: **Business Environment / Benefits**. Value is only realized if the business can *use* the product. The PM is responsible for Organizational Change Management (or coordinating with it) to ensure readiness. Delivering a shelf-ware product (A) is a failure.

### Question 35
**Answer: B**
*   **Explanation**: **People / Communication**. A "common language" is essential for cross-functional teams. Facilitating a workshop to define terms helps align mental models.

### Question 36
**Answer: C**
*   **Explanation**: **Process / Agile Ceremonies**. The standard sequence is Sprint Review -> Sprint Retrospective -> Sprint Planning (for next sprint). The Retrospective closes the sprint.

### Question 37
**Answer: B**
*   **Explanation**: **Business Environment / Compliance**. Project Managers are not lawyers. For specific regulatory questions (GDPR), always consult the internal experts (DPO/Legal).

### Question 38
**Answer: B**
*   **Explanation**: **People / Sustainable Pace**. Agile promotes a sustainable pace. Constant overtime leads to defects and burnout. The Servant Leader must protect the team and help them set realistic commitments.

### Question 39
**Answer: C**
*   **Explanation**: **Process / Hybrid**. You bridge the gap. Don't lie (B) and don't be dogmatic (A). Give a data-driven forecast: "Based on our velocity, we are 90% confident we will finish between Nov 10 and Nov 14."

### Question 40
**Answer: D**
*   **Explanation**: **Business Environment / Risk**. Hedging (A) involves paying a third party to manage the currency risk. Asking the vendor to quote in local currency (C) shifts the risk to the vendor. Both are Transfer strategies.

### Question 41
**Answer: C**
*   **Explanation**: **People / Servant Leadership**. While teams should solve their own problems, lack of access is often an organizational impediment that requires the PM/Scrum Master's authority to resolve.

### Question 42
**Answer: A**
*   **Explanation**: **Process / EVM**.
    *   CPI < 1 = Over Budget (Cost efficiency is poor).
    *   SPI > 1 = Ahead of Schedule (Speed efficiency is good).

### Question 43
**Answer: A**
*   **Explanation**: **Business Environment / Sustainability**. If the company has a *strict* policy, it is a constraint. A feature that violates a constraint (even if "better") is non-compliant.

### Question 44
**Answer: B**
*   **Explanation**: **People / Self-Organization**. The team owns their process. If they believe 1-week sprints will help them (e.g., faster feedback), they should be allowed to try it.

### Question 45
**Answer: C**
*   **Explanation**: **Process / Procurement**. When scope is vague, Fixed Price (A) is dangerous for the vendor (they will pad the price). Cost Plus (B) is dangerous for the buyer. T&M is good for agile/vague scope, and the "Not to Exceed" cap protects the budget.

### Question 46
**Answer: B**
*   **Explanation**: **Business Environment / Stakeholders**. Opponents are stakeholders. Ignoring them (A) is a huge risk; they can derail the project. You must engage them to understand and mitigate.

### Question 47
**Answer: B**
*   **Explanation**: **People / Psychological Safety**. If people are afraid to speak up because of criticism, Psychological Safety is missing. This prevents improvement and innovation.

### Question 48
**Answer: C**
*   **Explanation**: **Process / Risk**. **Mitigation** reduces the *probability* or *impact* of a risk. The tent reduces the *impact* of the rain (the work doesn't stop).

### Question 49
**Answer: B**
*   **Explanation**: **Business Environment / Compliance**. "Explainability" and "Fairness" are key components of AI Governance and Ethics, which fall under the Business Environment domain (Compliance/Regulatory/Organizational Standards).

### Question 50
**Answer: B**
*   **Explanation**: **People / Development**. If the root cause of poor performance is a skill gap, the solution is training. (A) is unfair. (D) is not sustainable.

### Question 51
**Answer: B**
*   **Explanation**: **Process / Agile**. The **Definition of Done (DoD)** is the agreed-upon checklist of criteria that *every* user story must meet to be considered complete (e.g., Code, Test, Docs). If the DoD requires documentation, the story is not done, even if the story text didn't mention it. Acceptance Criteria (C) are specific to the story functionality. DoD is global.

### Question 52
**Answer: B**
*   **Explanation**: **Business Environment / Compliance**. Falsifying documents (A) is a major ethical violation. Ignoring it (D) is negligence. Asking the team to do it now (C) implies checking *current* conditions, not past ones. The correct step is to **Halt and Analyze** (B). You have a quality/compliance breach. You need to understand the scope of the failure before proceeding.

### Question 53
**Answer: C**
*   **Explanation**: **People / Stakeholders**. The Power/Interest Grid is dynamic. A "High Power" stakeholder who suddenly shows interest has effectively moved to the "Manage Closely" quadrant. Ignoring them (B) is dangerous because they have High Power (can cancel the project). You need to engage immediately.

### Question 54
**Answer: C**
*   **Explanation**: **Process / Schedule**.
    *   Path 1: Start -> A(5) -> B(3) -> D(6) -> End = 14 days.
    *   Path 2: Start -> A(5) -> C(4) -> E(2) -> End = 11 days.
    *   Critical Path is the longest path = **14 days**.

### Question 55
**Answer: C**
*   **Explanation**: **Business Environment / Value**. PMPs focus on **Value**, not just volume. The agile/value-driven approach is to reframe the conversation around the **MVP**. Delivering 20 high-quality features that work is better than 50 broken ones. (A) is setting up for failure. (B) is too binary.

### Question 56
**Answer: C**
*   **Explanation**: **People / Conflict**. While removal is a last resort, you have exhausted all other options (coaching, warnings, HR). A single toxic individual can destroy the performance of the whole team. Protecting the team environment (Psychological Safety) is more important than one person's technical skill.

### Question 57
**Answer: C**
*   **Explanation**: **Process / Tailoring**. You don't ignore governance (A/B). You proactively **Tailor** the approach. PMPs are expected to advocate for the right methodology. Proposing a hybrid solution (Agile dev + Waterfall governance) is the professional way to handle this.

### Question 58
**Answer: B**
*   **Explanation**: **Business Environment / Governance**. Even if the PM doesn't *own* the benefits (often the Sponsor/Program Manager does), the PM is responsible for ensuring the project supports them. Governance gates require these artifacts. The lesson is that the PM must ensure alignment and artifacts are ready.

### Question 59
**Answer: C**
*   **Explanation**: **People / Resource Planning**. If you lack a skill, you must acquire it. Updating the risk register (B) is good, but (C) is the **Action**. You need to plan and budget for the solution (Training or Hiring).

### Question 60
**Answer: C**
*   **Explanation**: **Process / Agile Planning**. The PM/Scrum Master should protect the team from over-commitment. Using **historical data** (velocity) to challenge optimism is a key service. (A) sets them up to fail. (B) is passive.

### Question 61
**Answer: B**
*   **Explanation**: **Business Environment / Cost**.
    *   **Contingency Reserve**: For "Known-Unknowns" (Identified risks). Included in the Cost Baseline.
    *   **Management Reserve**: For "Unknown-Unknowns" (Unidentified risks). Requires a change request.
    *   Since this was identified in the Risk Register, use the **Contingency Reserve**.

### Question 62
**Answer: C**
*   **Explanation**: **People / Agile Decision Making**. In Agile, we value empirical data over opinion. A **Spike** is a time-boxed investigation to generate data. Flipping a coin (A) is random. Manager choice (B) is command-and-control.

### Question 63
**Answer: C**
*   **Explanation**: **Process / Scope**. This is "Verification vs. Validation." The product was Verified (met specs) but failed Validation (customer acceptance). You cannot force them (A). You must accept the reality: the product needs to change. Since the specs were met, this is a **Change Request** (new scope), not a defect repair.

### Question 64
**Answer: B**
*   **Explanation**: **Business Environment / Compliance**. AI models trained on poisoned/illegal data often cannot be legally used. This is a critical issue. GDPR fines are massive. You must report it and likely retrain. (A) is insufficient (the model remembers).

### Question 65
**Answer: B**
*   **Explanation**: **People / Ethics & Safety**. Team safety is the #1 priority. Harassment is zero-tolerance. You must act immediately to protect the person. "The customer is always right" does not apply to abuse.

### Question 66
**Answer: B**
*   **Explanation**: **Process / Agile Facilitation**. The Daily Standup has a specific purpose: Inspection and Adaptation of the plan for the next 24 hours. It is not for problem-solving. The Scrum Master failed to protect the timebox.

### Question 67
**Answer: B**
*   **Explanation**: **Business Environment / Security**. You never lower your standards (C). You isolate the risk. "Air-gapping" or delaying integration is the responsible security decision.

### Question 68
**Answer: B**
*   **Explanation**: **People / Support**. Resistance often comes from lack of **Ability** (skills). The Servant Leader approach is to support and train, not to force (A) or enable the dysfunction (C).

### Question 69
**Answer: C**
*   **Explanation**: **Process / Cost**. **Analogous Estimating** uses historical data from a similar activity or project. It is gross-level and quick but less accurate.

### Question 70
**Answer: B**
*   **Explanation**: **Business Environment / Value**. "Gold-Plating" (adding extras) is bad practice. It consumes resources, adds maintenance costs, and introduces risk without adding defined business value.

### Question 71
**Answer: C**
*   **Explanation**: **People / Agile**. Don't be the "Board Police." Bring the problem to the team. If the board isn't up to date, the process is broken. Let the team solve the root cause (maybe the tool is too slow?).

### Question 72
**Answer: C**
*   **Explanation**: **Process / Scope**. The **8/80 Rule** is a standard heuristic for WBS Work Packages. Work should not be smaller than 8 hours (micromanagement) or larger than 80 hours (too hard to track).

### Question 73
**Answer: B**
*   **Explanation**: **Business Environment / Compliance**. New laws are mandatory constraints. You cannot ignore them (A). You must implement the change. Since it affects the budget, you submit a Change Request.

### Question 74
**Answer: B**
*   **Explanation**: **People / Virtual Teams**. Lack of trust in remote teams often comes from a lack of social connection ("Affinity"). Creating space for non-work interaction helps build the "Social Capital" needed for work trust.

### Question 75
**Answer: B**
*   **Explanation**: **Process / Agile**. The PO owns priority, but the Team owns quality. The PM/SM helps the team translate "Technical Debt" into "Business Risk" (e.g., "If we don't fix this, the site will crash on Black Friday"). This helps the PO make an informed trade-off.

### Question 76
**Answer: C**
*   **Explanation**: **Business Environment / Compliance**. Grant terms are legal constraints. Violating them puts the funding at risk. You must enforce the requirement.

### Question 77
**Answer: C**
*   **Explanation**: **People / Stakeholders**. Emotional intelligence. Don't fight (A). Acknowledge the gap. The Sprint Review is *for* feedback. Finding out it's wrong now is better than at the end. Embrace the feedback, but protect the team from the hostility.

### Question 78
**Answer: B**
*   **Explanation**: **Process / Schedule**.
    *   **Crashing**: Adding resources (costs money).
    *   **Fast Tracking**: Overlapping tasks (adds risk).
    *   Since CPI is 1.1 (Under Budget), you have money. Crashing is the logical choice to fix the schedule (SPI 0.9).

### Question 79
**Answer: C**
*   **Explanation**: **Business Environment / Governance**. Governance requires data. The organization cannot manage the portfolio if projects don't report. It is your professional duty to report accurately.

### Question 80
**Answer: B**
*   **Explanation**: **People / Knowledge Management**. **Knowledge Transfer** is critical. Don't wait. Start capturing their tacit knowledge immediately.

### Question 81
**Answer: B**
*   **Explanation**: **Process / Agile**. If the sprint goal is met early, the team consults the backlog and pulls in work they can confidently finish. (A) is waste. (C) carries work over.

### Question 82
**Answer: C**
*   **Explanation**: **Business Environment / Social Impact**. Legal permit != Social License. Ignoring the community leads to protests, delays, and reputational damage. Engagement and mitigation is the PMP way.

### Question 83
**Answer: B**
*   **Explanation**: **People / Tuckman**. **Storming** is normal. You don't stop it; you guide them through it. It's where the team figures out how to work together.

### Question 84
**Answer: A**
*   **Explanation**: **Process / Quality**. A **Metric** is a measurement used to assess quality. "Defects per KLOC" is a standard software quality metric.

### Question 85
**Answer: B**
*   **Explanation**: **Business Environment**. Platforms (Apple/Google) are part of the external business environment. A change in their rules is a change in the environment the project operates in.

### Question 86
**Answer: C**
*   **Explanation**: **People / Agile**. In Agile, the team is self-managing. They estimate their own tasks and determine how much effort it takes.

### Question 87
**Answer: C**
*   **Explanation**: **Process / Cost**. **Bottom-Up Estimating** (summing up every detailed task) is the most accurate but the most time-consuming.

### Question 88
**Answer: B**
*   **Explanation**: **Business Environment / Sustainability**. Align with organizational goals. "Zero Waste" means you must analyze the process to eliminate the waste.

### Question 89
**Answer: B**
*   **Explanation**: **People / Leadership**. **Delegation is not abdication.** The manager retains accountability and must provide support/check-ins.

### Question 90
**Answer: B**
*   **Explanation**: **Process / Agile**. DoD creates a **Shared Understanding** of quality. It prevents technical debt and ensures the Increment is potentially shippable.

### Question 91
**Answer: B**
*   **Explanation**: **Business Environment / AI**. **Human in the Loop** is a standard risk mitigation strategy for Generative AI in customer-facing roles.

### Question 92
**Answer: B**
*   **Explanation**: **People / Engagement**. Don't force fun. **Ask the team** what they need. Maybe they hate Zoom happy hours and prefer a video game or just no meetings.

### Question 93
**Answer: C**
*   **Explanation**: **Process / Procurement**.
    *   Build: $50,000 + 10x
    *   Buy: 20x
    *   50,000 + 10x = 20x
    *   50,000 = 10x
    *   x = 5,000

### Question 94
**Answer: B**
*   **Explanation**: **Business Environment / Prioritization**. **Regulatory/Compliance** items usually take precedence over "Delighters" (Kano model) because of the risk of non-compliance.

### Question 95
**Answer: C**
*   **Explanation**: **People / Negotiation**. **Integrative Negotiation** (Win-Win) looks for variables other than price. "Expanding the pie."

### Question 96
**Answer: B**
*   **Explanation**: **Process / Agile**. The value of the Retrospective is **Adaptation**. If no action items are taken, or they are ignored, the team sees the meeting as a waste.

### Question 97
**Answer: B**
*   **Explanation**: **Business Environment / OCM**. The project delivered the Output (Portal), but OCM failed to drive Adoption. No adoption = No Benefit.

### Question 98
**Answer: B**
*   **Explanation**: **People / Agile Roles**. The Scrum Master protects the team. Outsiders shouldn't disrupt the Daily Standup. Be polite but firm: "Let's catch up after."

### Question 99
**Answer: B**
*   **Explanation**: **Process / Risk**. **Monte Carlo** is a computerized simulation used for Quantitative Risk Analysis to determine the probability of achieving targets (e.g., "We have an 85% chance of finishing by June").

### Question 100
**Answer: B**
*   **Explanation**: **Business Environment / Ethics**. This is a conflict of interest and nepotism. It compromises the project's integrity. Refuse.

### Question 101
**Answer: A**
*   **Explanation**: **Process / Risk**. EMV = Probability x Impact.
    *   10% * $50,000 = $5,000.
    *   This helps you decide how much contingency reserve to allocate.

### Question 102
**Answer: C**
*   **Explanation**: **Business Environment / Compliance**. Contracts (NDAs) are legal constraints that usually supersede general internal policies. You cannot violate the NDA (A/D). Rejecting the client (B) is extreme. A "Walled Garden" (C) is the standard solution: isolate the data to stay compliant while working.

### Question 103
**Answer: C**
*   **Explanation**: **People / Development**. The junior is blocked. Punishing them (A) creates fear. Doing it for them (B) prevents learning. **Pairing** (C) is the Agile way to transfer knowledge and solve the problem simultaneously.

### Question 104
**Answer: C**
*   **Explanation**: **Process / Change Control**. Never judge a change by its size, but by its **Impact**. A "small" logo change impacts everything. You must evaluate the impact before saying Yes or No.

### Question 105
**Answer: B**
*   **Explanation**: **Business Environment / Compliance**. Regulatory requirements are binary. If the law says "Must have Spanish manual," shipping without it is illegal. It creates liability and recall risk.

### Question 106
**Answer: B**
*   **Explanation**: **People / Team**. A "Bus Factor" of 1 is a critical resource risk. The mitigation is **Knowledge Transfer**. Cross-training (T-shaped skills) ensures someone else can do the work if the expert disappears.

### Question 107
**Answer: D**
*   **Explanation**: **Process / Agile Estimation**. Wide variance in estimates indicates **ambiguity** or different understandings of the work. The conversation is the value, not the number. Discuss *why* they differ, then re-vote.

### Question 108
**Answer: B**
*   **Explanation**: **Business Environment / Ethics**. The **PMI Code of Ethics** addresses Conflict of Interest. You must disclose the conflict to the appropriate stakeholders and likely recuse yourself from the decision.

### Question 109
**Answer: B**
*   **Explanation**: **People / Virtual Teams**. Empathy first. Don't mandate (A) without understanding. There may be a valid reason (e.g., poor internet, crowded home). Find a way to engage that works for them.

### Question 110
**Answer: A**
*   **Explanation**: **Process / Quality**. The Fishbone (Cause-and-Effect) diagram is used for **Root Cause Analysis**.

### Question 111
**Answer: B**
*   **Explanation**: **Business Environment / Compliance**. Software licenses are legal contracts. Using GPL in a proprietary product can force you to open-source your code (Viral license). This is a massive strategic risk. You must block it or find an alternative.

### Question 112
**Answer: B**
*   **Explanation**: **People / Resource Negotiation**. You have a resource shortage. Negotiate. "Can I have them for 4 hours?" If not, escalate to the Sponsor (who holds the budget/authority) to solve the resource constraint.

### Question 113
**Answer: C**
*   **Explanation**: **Process / Hybrid**. Decoupling is the key. The Waterfall team needs certainty; the Agile team needs flexibility. The compromise is to lock down the **Interface (API Contract)** early. The Agile team can change the *implementation* later, as long as the *interface* stays the same.

### Question 114
**Answer: B**
*   **Explanation**: **Business Environment / Value**. Project Success != Product Success. You delivered the scope (Output), but the customer hates it (Outcome). You likely failed to validate the value or involve the customer enough.

### Question 115
**Answer: C**
*   **Explanation**: **People / Agile**. The Standup is for coordination, not storytelling. The Scrum Master must facilitate. "Take it offline" is the standard phrase to protect the timebox.

### Question 116
**Answer: B**
*   **Explanation**: **Process / Procurement**. **Liquidated Damages** are pre-agreed financial penalties for late delivery.

### Question 117
**Answer: C**
*   **Explanation**: **Business Environment / Stakeholders**. New stakeholders bring new risks. You don't blindly obey (A) or ignore (B). You analyze the data (Cost of Change) and present the business case. "We are 80% done; switching costs $1M and delays us 6 months." Logic usually wins.

### Question 137

*   **Explanation**: **People / Agile**. The Retrospective is for the team *only*. It requires total safety to admit mistakes. A senior stakeholder's presence usually silences the team. Politely protect the boundary.

### Question 146
**Answer: A**
*   **Explanation**: **Process / Quality**. Correlation helps identify cause. If "Hours Worked" correlates with "Defects," it strongly suggests fatigue/burnout is the root cause. The solution is to reduce overtime (Sustainable Pace).

**Answer: B**
*   **Explanation**: **People / Performance**. Don't accuse without proof. Gather data. Have a private conversation. "I noticed you missed X meetings and delivered Y. Help me understand what's happening." If the performance doesn't improve, use the formal HR process.

### Question 149
**Answer: C**
*   **Explanation**: **Process / Life Cycle**. When the distant future is unknown, **Rolling Wave Planning** (Adaptive/Hybrid) is best. Plan what you know (Year 1) and leave the rest high-level.

**Answer: A**
*   **Explanation**: **Process / Schedule**. Float = Late Start - Early Start (or LS - ES).
    *   10 - 5 = **5 days**.

**Answer: C**
*   **Explanation**: **Business Environment / Risk**. Legislative delays are **External Risks**.

### Question 172

### Question 173
**Answer: B**
