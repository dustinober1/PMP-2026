## 1.4d – Risk Management: Threats, Opportunities, and Probability

Sarah learns that managing projects is fundamentally about managing uncertainty. Some uncertainty is a threat (things that could go wrong); some is an opportunity (things that could go better than expected).

### 1.4d.1 What Is Risk?

Risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on project objectives.

**Threats** are risks that could have negative impacts:

- Resource shortage: Key team member gets sick
- Technical risk: The technology platform is less stable than expected
- Schedule risk: Contractor delays
- Scope creep: New requirements keep appearing
- Quality risk: Defects found late
- External risk: Market shifts, regulatory changes, competitive moves
- Organizational risk: Priorities change, funding is cut

**Opportunities** are risks that could have positive impacts:

- Efficiency gain: Team works faster than estimated
- Technical breakthrough: New approach solves the problem better
- Scope reduction: Stakeholders realize some requirements are not essential
- Quality improvement: Better processes reduce defects
- External opportunity: Market demand increases, partnership becomes available
- Cost reduction: Vendor offers better pricing

Sarah learns: **Good project managers proactively identify both threats and opportunities.**

### 1.4d.2 Risk Identification: What Could Go Wrong (or Right)?

Sarah practices identifying risks in her three projects.

**Office Renovation: Threat Identification**

- **Schedule risk**: Construction delays (weather, contractor resources, permitting)
- **Technical risk**: Soil conditions different than expected, requiring different foundation approach
- **Quality risk**: Contractor cuts corners to save cost
- **Scope risk**: New requirements (CEO wants more offices)
- **Resource risk**: Key architect is overcommitted
- **Regulatory risk**: Permit is delayed, city inspection fails
- **External risk**: Supply chain delays (steel, electrical panels)
- **Financial risk**: Contractor goes bankrupt mid-project

**Mitigation thinking**: For each threat, what could reduce the probability or impact?

- Schedule risk → Mitigate: Build schedule buffer into critical path, monitor contractor progress weekly, maintain escalation path with city permitting
- Technical risk → Mitigate: Do soil testing upfront before major scope commitments
- Quality risk → Mitigate: Detailed specifications, inspections at each phase, hold contractor accountable
- Scope risk → Mitigate: Formal change control, explain to CEO the impact of new requirements
- Regulatory risk → Mitigate: Engage city early, hire experienced general contractor who knows the process

**Office Renovation: Opportunity Identification**

- **Efficiency opportunity**: Use prefabricated components to reduce construction time
- **Cost opportunity**: Volume pricing on materials, multiple contractors bidding
- **Quality opportunity**: Hire experienced contractor with great track record
- **Scope opportunity**: Build some flexibility into design for future expansion
- **Technology opportunity**: Use smart building systems to improve efficiency

**Capture thinking**: For each opportunity, what could increase the probability or impact?

- Efficiency opportunity → Enhance: Research prefabrication options, add to contractor requirements
- Cost opportunity → Enhance: Bid to multiple contractors, negotiate bulk pricing
- Quality opportunity → Enhance: Check references, hire best team available
- Technology opportunity → Enhance: Build in infrastructure for future smart systems

**Expense System: Threat Identification**

- **Technical risk**: Platform chosen is less stable than expected
- **User adoption risk**: Users continue using the old system because new system is unfamiliar
- **Scope risk**: New requirements keep appearing from users
- **Schedule risk**: Developers overestimate velocity, sprints fall behind
- **Quality risk**: Mobile responsiveness is buggy on some devices
- **Integration risk**: Cannot integrate with downstream accounting system
- **Security risk**: Application vulnerability, data breach

**Mitigation thinking**:

- Technical risk → Mitigate: Do technical spike on platform; have backup platform option
- User adoption → Mitigate: Involve users in design, train thoroughly, provide support, phase out old system
- Scope risk → Mitigate: Prioritize ruthlessly, defer non-essential features to Phase 2
- Schedule risk → Mitigate: Track velocity, adjust backlog if team is slower than expected
- Quality risk → Mitigate: Cross-browser testing, automated testing for key features
- Integration risk → Mitigate: Start architecture conversations with accounting team early, avoid surprises
- Security risk → Mitigate: Security code review, penetration testing before launch, secure data storage

### 1.4d.3 Risk Analysis: How Bad Could It Get?

After identifying risks, Sarah learns to analyze them: How likely are they, and how bad would the impact be?

**Probability**: How likely is this risk to occur?
- High: Likely to occur (70–100%)
- Medium: Could occur (30–70%)
- Low: Unlikely (0–30%)

**Impact**: If it occurs, how bad is the consequence?
- High: Major impact on project (delay schedule, exceed budget, reduce quality significantly, fail to deliver)
- Medium: Moderate impact (small schedule delay, small cost increase, reduced scope)
- Low: Minor impact (small inconvenience, easily managed)

**Risk Score** = Probability × Impact

- High probability, high impact = Critical risk (must mitigate)
- High probability, low impact = Manage (annoying but manageable)
- Low probability, high impact = Reduce probability (unlikely but catastrophic if it happens)
- Low probability, low impact = Monitor (probably not worth investing in)

**Sarah's office renovation risk analysis:**

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Score | Priority | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|-------|----------|-----------|
| Schedule delay from contractor | High | High | Critical | 1 | Weekly meetings, penalties for delays, escalation path |
| Soil conditions different | Medium | High | High | 2 | Soil testing upfront, contingency in budget |
| CEO adds new requirements | Medium | High | High | 3 | Formal change control, explain impact to CEO |
| Permitting delay | Medium | Medium | Medium | 4 | Engage city early, experienced contractor |
| Prefab efficiency opportunity | Medium | Medium | Medium | Monitor | Research prefab options, add to requirements |

**Sarah's expense system risk analysis:**

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Score | Priority | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|-------|----------|-----------|
| Users do not adopt new system | Medium | High | High | 1 | User involvement, training, gradual rollout |
| Mobile feature buggy on some devices | Medium | Medium | Medium | 2 | Cross-browser testing, user feedback |
| Scope creep (new features keep appearing) | High | Medium | High | 2 | Ruthless prioritization, defer to Phase 2 |
| Technical platform instability | Low | High | Medium | 3 | Do technical spike, have backup option |
| Integration with accounting system fails | Low | High | Medium | 3 | Early architecture conversations |

### 1.4d.4 Risk Response Strategies

For each risk, Sarah chooses a response strategy:

**For Threats:**

- **Avoid**: Eliminate the risk by changing the project approach
  - Example: If building cost is too high, redesign to reduce scope
  - Trade-off: Takes more effort upfront but eliminates the risk

- **Mitigate**: Reduce the probability or impact
  - Example: Weekly contractor meetings reduce chance of surprises; contingency budget reduces impact of cost overruns
  - Trade-off: Costs money or effort but reduces risk

- **Transfer**: Shift the risk to someone else
  - Example: Contract with a fixed-price contractor (contractor assumes cost/schedule risk); insurance covers certain risks
  - Trade-off: You pay for someone else to bear the risk

- **Accept**: Acknowledge the risk and plan to respond if it occurs
  - Example: Accept that a city permit might take 8 weeks; build it into the schedule as buffer
  - Trade-off: You are ready to respond, but the risk is not prevented

**For Opportunities:**

- **Exploit**: Take action to ensure the opportunity happens
  - Example: Invest in researching prefabrication to ensure the team uses it
  - Trade-off: Requires upfront investment

- **Enhance**: Increase the probability or impact
  - Example: Actively solicit user feedback to ensure you capture improvement ideas
  - Trade-off: Takes time and effort, but increases upside

- **Share**: Partner with someone to increase the likelihood or benefit
  - Example: Partner with a contractor who specializes in sustainable building to enhance the green building opportunity
  - Trade-off: Must share the benefit

- **Accept**: If it happens, great; if not, no harm
  - Example: If we get better pricing, use it; if not, no problem
  - Trade-off: No action needed, but also no guarantee of benefit

**Sarah's risk responses:**

- **Threat (schedule delay)**: Mitigate with weekly contractor meetings and penalties. Transfer some risk to contractor via fixed-price contract. Accept that some small delays are inevitable; build buffer in critical path.
- **Threat (user adoption)**: Mitigate with user involvement, training, gradual rollout. Avoid pure "big bang" replacement (all users switch at once).
- **Opportunity (efficiency)**: Enhance by researching prefab options and including in contractor requirements. Share benefit with contractor (if they use prefab, they complete faster, meet date, earn bonus).

### 1.4d.5 Risk Monitoring and Control

Risk management does not end with planning. Throughout the project, Sarah monitors:

- **Are the identified risks actually occurring?** If so, implement the response strategy.
- **Are new risks emerging?** Identify and assess them.
- **Have risks changed** (become more or less likely/impactful)? Adjust the response.
- **Have risk owners been assigned** and are they taking action? Follow up.

**Sarah's office project:**

- Monthly risk review: Update the risk register
- Month 2: Soil testing reveals no major issues → Soil risk downgraded from High to Low
- Month 6: City permitting is running on schedule → Permitting risk downgraded
- Month 8: Contractor identifies potential steel supply chain delay → New risk identified, contractor mitigates by ordering early
- Month 12: New requirement emerges (CEO wants fitness center) → Triggers change control, assessed as High impact/probability, denied or scope is adjusted

**Sarah's expense system project:**

- Sprint retrospectives include risk discussion: "Are we seeing any risks?"
- Sprint 2: User feedback is positive, adoption risk downgraded
- Sprint 4: Mobile testing reveals bugs on Safari → Increases quality risk temporarily, team fixes
- Sprint 5: New regulatory requirement for expense auditing emerges → Mitigated by adjusting architecture
- Sprint 6: Platform stability is solid, technical risk downgraded

### 1.4d.6 The Risk Register

Sarah maintains a risk register: a living document that lists all identified risks, their analysis, response strategies, and status.

| Risk ID | Risk Description | Category | Probability | Impact | Score | Response Strategy | Owner | Status |
|---------|------------------|----------|-------------|--------|-------|-------------------|-------|--------|
| R-1 | Contractor schedule delays | Schedule | High | High | Critical | Mitigate: Weekly meetings, penalties. Transfer: Fixed-price contract. | PM | Active, monitoring |
| R-2 | Soil conditions worse than expected | Technical | Medium | High | High | Mitigate: Soil testing upfront. Accept: Contingency budget. | Contractor | Mitigated |
| R-3 | CEO adds new requirements | Scope | Medium | High | High | Mitigate: Formal change control. Accept: May defer some requests. | PM | Monitoring |
| R-4 | Users do not adopt new system | Adoption | Medium | High | High | Mitigate: User involvement, training, gradual rollout. | Product Owner | Active |
| R-5 | Scope creep (new features) | Scope | High | Medium | High | Mitigate: Ruthless prioritization, defer to Phase 2. | Product Owner | Monitoring |

The register is reviewed regularly (monthly in predictive projects, in each sprint retrospective in agile projects) and updated as circumstances change.

### 1.4d.7 Risk and Ways of Working

Sarah notices that risk management looks different depending on the approach:

**In Predictive Projects:**

- Risks are identified upfront in planning
- Mitigation strategies are built into the plan (schedule buffer, contingency budget, quality processes)
- Risks are monitored against the plan
- When a risk occurs, change control is used to adjust the plan

**In Agile Projects:**

- Risks are identified continuously (sprint planning, retrospectives)
- Mitigation is often quick iteration and feedback (technical spike, user validation)
- Risks are monitored frequently (daily stand-ups, sprint reviews, retrospectives)
- When a risk occurs, the backlog is reprioritized or the approach is adjusted

**In Hybrid Projects:**

- Program-level risks (schedule, budget, stakeholder alignment) are managed predictively
- Team-level risks (technical, scope) are managed agilely
- Risk escalation is clear: Team-level risks escalate to program if they affect schedule or budget

### 1.4d.8 On the Exam: Risk Scenarios

Exam questions test risk thinking by presenting scenarios with risks and asking you to identify the best response.

**Common question patterns:**

- *"You identify a risk with high probability and high impact. What should you do?"*
- *"A risk has occurred. How should you respond?"*
- *"You discover a project opportunity. How should you handle it?"*
- *"You notice a risk trend (risks are increasing). What does this signal?"*

**Red flag answers:**

- Ignore the risk and hope it does not happen
- Wait for the risk to occur, then react (instead of planning in advance)
- Assume someone else is managing the risk
- Treat all risks equally (high priority and low priority risks get same attention)

**Good answers:**

- Identify and assess the risk (probability, impact)
- Choose an appropriate response strategy (avoid, mitigate, transfer, accept)
- Assign an owner responsible for monitoring and response
- Monitor the risk throughout the project
- If the risk changes, adjust the response
- If a new risk emerges, assess and respond
- Learn from risks for future projects
