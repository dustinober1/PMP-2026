## Domain Weights

The PMP exam is organized around three domains with the following weights:

| Domain | Weight | Approximate Questions |
|--------|--------|----------------------|
| **People** | 33% | ~61 questions |
| **Process** | 41% | ~76 questions |
| **Business Environment** | 26% | ~48 questions |

### Delivery Approach Distribution
- **Predictive approaches**: ~40% of exam items
- **Adaptive/Agile and Hybrid approaches**: ~60% of exam items

**Important**: Delivery approaches are integrated across all three domains, not separated into distinct sections.

## Domain Distribution Guidelines

### For Knowledge Checks
Target distribution should approximate exam weights:
- People: 33% of questions
- Process: 41% of questions
- Business Environment: 26% of questions

**Example for 12-question knowledge check:**
- People: 4 questions (33%)
- Process: 5 questions (42%)
- Business Environment: 3 questions (25%)

### For Practice Exams
Exact distribution for 185 questions:
- People: 61 questions (33%)
- Process: 76 questions (41%)
- Business Environment: 48 questions (26%)

### For Study Plans
Time allocation should reflect domain weights:
- Process gets most study time (41%)
- People gets substantial time (33%)
- Business Environment requires deliberate focus (26%)

**Example for 12-week study plan:**
- Process: ~5 weeks
- People: ~4 weeks
- Business Environment: ~3 weeks

## Tagging Questions with Domain and ECO Tasks

### Format for Question Tags

**Recommended format:**
```markdown
**Domain**: [People / Process / Business Environment] ([percentage]%)
**ECO Task**: [Brief description of the task being tested]
```

**Example:**
```markdown
**Domain**: People (33%)
**ECO Task**: Manage conflict by identifying source and facilitating resolution
```

### Why Tag Questions?

1. **Ensures balanced coverage** across domains
2. **Helps readers identify** which domain they need to strengthen
3. **Validates alignment** with official ECO
4. **Supports performance tracking** by domain
5. **Guides study prioritization** based on weaknesses

---

## Scoring and Performance Levels

### How the Exam is Scored
- PMI uses psychometric modeling (not a fixed percentage)
- Questions weighted by difficulty
- Pass/fail determined by overall performance across domains

### Performance Levels by Domain
You will receive one of four levels for each domain:
- **Above Target**: Performance exceeds PMI's standard
- **Target**: Performance meets PMI's standard
- **Below Target**: Performance below standard; additional preparation recommended
- **Needs Improvement**: Performance significantly below standard

### Goal for Preparation
- Aim for **Target** or **Above Target** in all three domains
- Cannot ignore any domain—each is substantial
- Weakness in one domain can be offset by strength in others, but aim for balance

## Changes from 2021-2025 Exam

### Domain Weight Shifts
| Domain | 2021-2025 | 2026 | Change |
|--------|-----------|------|--------|
| People | 42% | 33% | -9% |
| Process | 50% | 41% | -9% |
| Business Environment | 8% | 26% | +18% |

### Key Implications
- **Business Environment** more than triples in importance
- Greater emphasis on strategy, benefits, value, governance, sustainability
- People and Process still critical but relatively less weighted
- Must deliberately build strength in Business Environment topics

### Content Emphasis Shifts
- More focus on value and outcomes vs. outputs
- Increased emphasis on sustainability and ESG
- Greater recognition of AI and emerging technologies
- Stronger integration of agile and hybrid approaches
- More scenario-based, practicum-style questions
