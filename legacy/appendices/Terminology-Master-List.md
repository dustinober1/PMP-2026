## A

### Acceptance Criteria
Measurable conditions that must be met for deliverables to be accepted by stakeholders. In agile contexts, often part of the Definition of Done.

### Adaptive Approach
See: Agile Approach

### Agile Approach
An iterative and incremental delivery approach that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, customer feedback, and continuous improvement. Includes frameworks such as Scrum, Kanban, XP, and others.

### Assumption
A factor considered to be true, real, or certain without proof or demonstration. Assumptions carry risk if they prove to be false.

---

## B

### BAC (Budget at Completion)
The total planned budget for the project or work package. Used in Earned Value Management calculations.

### Backlog
An ordered list of work items, features, or requirements to be completed. In agile contexts, typically maintained by the Product Owner and prioritized by business value.

### Baseline
An approved version of a work product (scope, schedule, cost) that can be changed only through formal change control procedures. Used as a reference point for performance measurement.

### Benefit
A measurable improvement resulting from an outcome that is perceived as an advantage by one or more stakeholders. Benefits contribute to value.

### Benefits Realization
The process of ensuring that project outcomes deliver the expected benefits defined in the business case. Includes planning, tracking, and measuring benefits during and after project delivery.

### Business Case
A documented economic feasibility study used to establish validity of the benefits of a selected component lacking sufficient definition and that is used as a basis for the authorization of further project management activities.

### Business Environment Domain
One of three PMP exam domains (26% of exam). Focuses on strategy alignment, benefits and value, compliance, governance, and sustainability.

---

## C

### CAPM (Certified Associate in Project Management)

### Change Control
A process whereby modifications to documents, deliverables, or baselines are identified, documented, approved, or rejected.

### Change Management
The process of transitioning individuals, teams, and organizations from a current state to a desired future state to realize benefits. Includes communication, training, and adoption strategies.

### Constraint
A limiting factor that affects the execution of a project, program, portfolio, or process. Common constraints include scope, schedule, cost, quality, resources, and risk.

### Cost Performance Index (CPI)
An Earned Value Management metric calculated as EV / AC. Indicates cost efficiency: CPI > 1.0 means under budget; CPI < 1.0 means over budget.

### Critical Path
The sequence of activities that determines the minimum project duration. Activities on the critical path have zero float.

---

## D

### Definition of Done (DoD)

### Deliverable
Any unique and verifiable product, result, or capability to perform a service that is required to be produced to complete a process, phase, or project.

### Dependency
A relationship between two activities or between an activity and a milestone. Types include finish-to-start, start-to-start, finish-to-finish, and start-to-finish.

---

## E

### EAC (Estimate at Completion)
The expected total cost of completing all work. Common formula: BAC / CPI.

### Earned Value (EV)
The measure of work performed expressed in terms of the budget authorized for that work. A key metric in Earned Value Management.

A methodology that combines scope, schedule, and resource measurements to assess project performance and progress. Uses metrics like CPI, SPI, EAC, and TCPI.

### ECO (Exam Content Outline)
PMI's official document defining the structure, content, and tasks for the PMP certification exam. Updated periodically to reflect current practice.

### Escalation
The process of engaging higher levels of authority or management to resolve issues, make decisions, or provide resources beyond the project manager's authority.

---

## F

### Float (Slack)
The amount of time an activity can be delayed without delaying the project finish date (total float) or a successor activity (free float).

### Governance
The framework, functions, and processes that guide project management activities to create value aligned with organizational strategy. Includes decision-making structures, policies, and oversight.

---

## H

### Hybrid Approach
A combination of predictive and agile approaches tailored to the project context. May use predictive planning with agile execution, or phase-based delivery with iterative development within phases.

---

## I

### Increment
A functional, tested, and potentially shippable addition to the product. In Scrum, produced at the end of each Sprint.

### Issue
A current condition or situation that may impact project objectives. Unlike risks (which are uncertain future events), issues are happening now and require immediate attention.

### Iteration
A timeboxed cycle of development work. In agile contexts, synonymous with Sprint in Scrum.

---

## K

### Kanban
An agile approach that visualizes work, limits work in progress, and focuses on flow and continuous delivery. Uses a Kanban board to track work items through stages.

---

## L

### Lessons Learned
Knowledge gained during a project that shows how project events were addressed or should be addressed in the future to improve performance. Captured throughout the project and formally documented at closure.

---

## M

### Milestone

### Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
The smallest version of a product that can be released to gather validated learning about customers with the least effort.

---

## O

### Outcome
The end result or consequence of a process or project. Outcomes describe changes in behavior or conditions that result from using project outputs. Outcomes enable benefits.

### Output
A tangible or intangible artifact, product, service, or result produced by a project. Outputs enable outcomes.

### Program
A group of related projects, subsidiary programs, and program activities managed in a coordinated manner to obtain benefits not available from managing them individually.

### Progressive Elaboration
The iterative process of increasing the level of detail in a project management plan as greater amounts of information and more accurate estimates become available.

## Notes on Usage

### Capitalization
- Capitalize formal PMI terms: Project Manager, Product Owner, Scrum Master, Sprint, Definition of Done
- Lowercase when used generically: "the project manager should...", "during the sprint..."
- Always capitalize domain names: People, Process, Business Environment

### Acronyms
- Define on first use in each chapter: "Earned Value Management (EVM)"
- Use acronym consistently thereafter: "EVM metrics show..."
- Common acronyms: PMP, PMI, PMBOK, ECO, EVM, WBS, RACI, MVP, CPI, SPI, BAC, EAC, TCPI

### Scenario Names
- Always use exact names: "Office Renovation," "Expense System," "Transformation Program"
- Capitalize as proper nouns
- Use consistently across all references

### PMI Terminology Preferences
- Use "agile" not "Agile" (lowercase unless starting a sentence)
- Use "predictive" not "waterfall" (PMI's preferred term)
- Use "iteration" or "Sprint" depending on context (Sprint is Scrum-specific)
- Use "stakeholder engagement" not "stakeholder management"
- Use "servant leadership" not "servant-leadership"
