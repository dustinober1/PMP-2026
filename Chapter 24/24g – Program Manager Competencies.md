## Introduction

Sarah's journey from project manager to program manager involved more than just learning new processes—it required developing entirely new capabilities. "When I started managing programs," she reflected, "I thought my project management skills would be enough. I was wrong. Program management demanded different thinking, different skills, and different approaches."

Her first major lesson came during a stakeholder conflict. Two business unit leaders couldn't agree on system integration priorities. Her project management instinct was to escalate to the sponsor for a decision. But her program mentor advised differently: "Sarah, program managers don't just escalate problems—they solve them. You need to facilitate a solution that both leaders can support."

Through mentoring, self-reflection, and experience, Sarah developed the competencies needed for program success. She learned to think strategically, lead through influence, manage complexity, and create value through coordination.

**Program manager competencies** are the knowledge, skills, and behaviors that enable effective program management. The Standard for Program Management identifies three competency domains: Technical Program Management, Leadership, and Strategic and Business Management. This section explores these competencies and how to develop them.

- Governance and oversight
- Risk and issue management
- Quality and compliance management
- Resource and financial management

**Key Competencies**:
- Vision and inspiration
- Influence and persuasion
- Team building and development
- Communication and facilitation
- Negotiation and conflict resolution
- Emotional intelligence
- Cultural awareness and diversity
