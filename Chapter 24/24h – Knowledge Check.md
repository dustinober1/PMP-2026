## Question 1

A program manager is leading a 3-year digital transformation program that includes seven component projects. During the quarterly benefits review, the program manager discovers that while most projects are on schedule and budget, benefits realization is only 60% of target. Stakeholders are becoming concerned about the program's value.

**What should the program manager do FIRST?**

A) Re-plan the remaining projects to accelerate benefit delivery
B) Conduct a comprehensive benefits analysis to understand the shortfall
C) Immediately escalate the issue to the program steering committee
D) Communicate the benefit shortfall to all stakeholders

**Answer: B**

**Explanation**:

The program manager should first understand the root cause of the benefit shortfall before taking action. A comprehensive benefits analysis will help identify:
- Which specific benefits are underperforming and why
- Whether the shortfall is due to delays, adoption issues, or unrealistic targets
- What corrective actions are needed to improve benefit realization

Option A (re-planning projects) might be necessary, but only after understanding the specific causes of the benefit shortfall.

Option C (escalating to steering committee) should be done after analysis and with recommended solutions, not as a first step.

Option D (communicating to stakeholders) is important but should come after understanding the issue and having a plan to address it.

## Question 2

A program manager is establishing governance for a global supply chain transformation program with components in North America, Europe, and Asia. The program operates in a matrix organization with strong regional autonomy.

**Which governance structure would be MOST effective for this program?**

A) Centralized steering committee with regional implementation teams
B) Regional steering committees with global coordination council
C) Single global program office with direct authority over all components
D) Network of regional program managers with collaborative decision-making

**Answer: B**

**Explanation**:

Given the matrix organization with strong regional autonomy and global scope, a federated governance structure works best:

Regional steering committees provide:
- Local decision-making authority respecting regional autonomy
- Understanding of regional markets, regulations, and business practices
- Regional stakeholder representation and buy-in

Global coordination council ensures:
- Strategic alignment across all regions
- Coordination of inter-regional dependencies
- Global benefit realization and optimization
- Consistent standards and approaches where appropriate

Option A (centralized committee) would likely face resistance in a strong regional autonomy culture.

Option C (single global office) would conflict with the matrix structure and regional autonomy.

Option D (network of managers) might lack sufficient authority for major decisions and strategic alignment.

## Question 3

During program definition, a program manager identifies two conflicting stakeholder requirements. The finance department requires detailed financial controls and compliance reporting, while the development team wants rapid iteration with minimal documentation.

**How should the program manager handle this conflict?**

A) Prioritize finance requirements since compliance cannot be compromised
B) Adopt an agile approach with lightweight compliance controls
C) Create a hybrid approach that satisfies both requirements
D) Ask the steering committee to make the final decision

**Answer: C**

**Explanation**:

The program manager should create a hybrid approach that satisfies both valid requirements:

For finance requirements:
- Implement essential financial controls and compliance reporting
- Create automated compliance reporting to minimize manual documentation
- Schedule regular compliance reviews rather than continuous detailed reporting
- Use tools that generate compliance data from development processes

For development team requirements:
- Maintain agile development practices for rapid iteration
- Integrate compliance requirements into development tools and processes
- Minimize manual documentation through automation
- Focus compliance reporting on outcomes rather than detailed processes

This hybrid approach satisfies both stakeholder needs while maintaining program efficiency.

Option A (prioritizing finance) might unnecessarily constrain development agility.

Option B (agile with lightweight controls) might not satisfy legitimate compliance requirements.

Option D (escalating to steering committee) should be reserved for conflicts that cannot be resolved at the program level.

## Question 4

A program manager is transitioning a digital transformation program to operations. The program has delivered all planned components, but benefits realization is below target due to slower than expected user adoption.

**What is the MOST critical activity for ensuring benefits sustainment?**

A) Extend the program to provide additional adoption support
B) Transfer adoption responsibility to operations with clear metrics
C) Conduct a post-implementation review to identify adoption barriers
D) Implement a comprehensive user training program

**Answer: B**

**Explanation**:

The most critical activity is transferring adoption responsibility to operations with clear metrics, because:

- Program closure requires transitioning ownership to ongoing operations
- Adoption is an ongoing business process, not a one-time program activity
- Operations teams are positioned to drive adoption as part of normal business operations
- Clear metrics ensure ongoing accountability for adoption and benefits realization

While the other activities are valuable:
Option A (extending the program) delays necessary transition to operations ownership
Option C (post-implementation review) should inform the transition, not replace it
Option D (training program) should be implemented as part of the operational transition

---

## Question 5

A program manager is leading a regulatory compliance program with fixed requirements and strict deadlines. The program must deliver new systems and processes that meet regulatory standards by a government-mandated date.

**Which development approach is MOST appropriate for this program?**

A) Agile approach with iterative delivery and stakeholder feedback
B) Predictive approach with detailed upfront planning and formal change control
C) Hybrid approach with agile development and predictive integration
D) Lean approach with minimum viable features and continuous improvement

**Answer: B**

**Explanation**:

Given the regulatory compliance context with fixed requirements and strict deadlines, a predictive approach is most appropriate because:

Regulatory compliance programs require:
- Comprehensive upfront analysis of regulatory requirements
- Detailed documentation for audit and compliance purposes
- Formal change control to ensure continued compliance
- Predictable delivery to meet mandatory deadlines
- Extensive testing and validation to ensure compliance

Agile or hybrid approaches would be risky because:
- Requirements are fixed by regulations, not emergent
- Changes must be carefully controlled and documented
- Audit trails require formal documentation and processes
- Deadlines cannot be extended for iteration and discovery

## Question 6

During program execution, a key stakeholder who strongly supported the program during definition becomes resistant to change implementation. This stakeholder's department is critical to program success.

**What is the BEST approach for managing this situation?**

A) Escalate the resistance to the steering committee for resolution
B) Meet with the stakeholder to understand concerns and develop solutions
C) Proceed with implementation and address issues as they arise
D) Modify the program approach to accommodate the stakeholder's concerns

**Answer: B**

**Explanation**:

The best approach is to meet with the stakeholder to understand concerns and develop solutions because:

- Early engagement can prevent escalation and maintain relationship
- Understanding root causes helps identify appropriate solutions
- Collaborative problem-solving maintains stakeholder ownership
- Direct communication addresses issues before they become significant problems

Option A (escalation) should be a last resort when direct resolution fails.

Option C (proceeding anyway) would likely increase resistance and jeopardize success.

Option D (modifying approach) might be appropriate but only after understanding specific concerns.

## Question 7

A program manager is developing a benefits register for a strategic transformation program. The program vision is to become "the industry leader in digital customer experience."

**Which of the following would be the MOST appropriate strategic benefit for this program?**

A) 30% reduction in customer service costs through automation
B) Implementation of a new CRM system across all business units
C) Improved customer satisfaction scores leading to market share gains
D) Training of customer service teams on new digital tools

**Answer: C**

**Explanation**:

Improved customer satisfaction scores leading to market share gains is the most appropriate strategic benefit because:

- It directly supports the vision of industry leadership in customer experience
- It represents a strategic outcome rather than an operational improvement
- It connects to competitive position and market leadership
- It's measurable and directly linked to program success

Options A, B, and D are operational benefits that support the strategic benefit but are not strategic themselves:
- A is an operational efficiency benefit
- B is a deliverable/output, not a benefit
- D is a capability development activity

---

## Question 8

A program manager must select the most appropriate leadership style for a program that includes both innovative research projects with high uncertainty and infrastructure upgrades with well-defined requirements.

**Which leadership approach would be MOST effective?**

A) Consistent directive leadership across all program components
B) Situational leadership adapting style to component needs
C) Delegative leadership empowering teams to make decisions
D) Participative leadership involving all stakeholders in decisions

**Answer: B**

**Explanation**:

Situational leadership adapting style to component needs would be most effective because:

Different program components require different leadership approaches:
- Innovative research projects benefit from delegative, empowering leadership that encourages experimentation and creativity
- Infrastructure upgrades benefit from more directive, structured leadership that ensures compliance and quality control
- Mixed teams need leadership that can adapt based on team experience and task complexity

A single consistent style (Option A) would not effectively address the diverse needs of different components.

Purely delegative (Option C) or participative (Option D) approaches might not provide sufficient direction for the infrastructure components.

---

## Question 9

A program is experiencing schedule delays due to interdependencies between component projects. The mobile app project is waiting for the data platform project, which is waiting for the infrastructure project. Each project is managed by a different business unit with conflicting priorities.

**What is the MOST effective way to resolve this dependency issue?**

A) Re-plan program schedule to accommodate the delays
B) Escalate to portfolio management for priority setting
C) Implement program-level dependency management with cross-functional coordination
D) Allow individual projects to negotiate solutions directly

**Answer: C**

**Explanation**:

Program-level dependency management with cross-functional coordination is most effective because:

- Dependencies are a program-level issue that cannot be resolved by individual projects
- Cross-functional coordination addresses the root cause of conflicting priorities
- Program-level authority can override individual business unit priorities for program success
- Systematic dependency management prevents similar issues in the future

Option A (re-planning) addresses symptoms but not root causes.

Option B (escalation) might be necessary if program-level authority is insufficient.

Option D (direct negotiation) continues without addressing the structural issue.

## Question 10

A program manager is conducting the final closure review for a 2-year program. The program delivered all planned outputs and most expected benefits, but stakeholder satisfaction is lower than expected due to communication issues during execution.

**What is the MOST important lesson to capture for future programs?**

A) Comprehensive stakeholder communication planning is essential for program success
B) Project delivery excellence does not guarantee stakeholder satisfaction
C) Regular stakeholder satisfaction surveys should be implemented throughout programs
D) Communication quality is as important as technical delivery for program success

**Answer: A**

**Explanation**:

The most important lesson is that comprehensive stakeholder communication planning is essential for program success because:

- Communication planning is a proactive approach that prevents issues
- Stakeholder communication should be integrated into program planning from the beginning
- Comprehensive planning addresses content, frequency, channels, and stakeholder needs
- This lesson provides actionable guidance for future program planning

While the other lessons are valid:
Option B is true but doesn't provide specific guidance for improvement
Option C is a good practice but addresses monitoring rather than prevention
Option D is true but communication planning is the root cause solution

## Question 11

A program manager must select the best approach for tailoring program management processes for an organization with hierarchical culture, high risk aversion, and extensive regulatory requirements.

**Which tailoring approach would be MOST appropriate?**

A) Agile approaches with minimal documentation and adaptive planning
B) Hybrid approaches with formal governance and flexible execution
C) Predictive approaches with detailed planning and formal controls
D) Lean approaches focused on efficiency and waste elimination

**Answer: C**

**Explanation**:

Predictive approaches with detailed planning and formal controls would be most appropriate because:

Organizational characteristics indicate need for:
- Hierarchical culture requires formal authority and clear decision processes
- High risk aversion requires detailed risk management and control
- Regulatory requirements demand documentation and compliance processes
- Predictive approaches provide the structure and control needed in this context

Agile or lean approaches would likely conflict with the organizational culture and risk tolerance.

Hybrid approaches might be appropriate but should lean heavily toward predictive given the organizational context.

## Question 12

During program definition, a program manager is developing the benefits register. The program will deliver multiple systems and process changes across the organization.

**Which stakeholder group should be PRIMARY owner of operational benefits after program closure?**

A) Program manager responsible for benefit tracking during execution
B) Business process owners who manage ongoing operations
C) Executive sponsor who championed the program
D) Program management office that monitors organizational performance

**Answer: B**

**Explanation**:

Business process owners should be primary owners of operational benefits after program closure because:

- Process owners have ongoing accountability for operational performance
- They are positioned to sustain benefits through daily operational management
- Benefits sustainment requires integration into normal business processes
- Process owners have the authority and resources to maintain benefit delivery

The program manager (A) transitions out after closure.
The executive sponsor (C) provides strategic oversight but not operational management.
The PMO (D) might monitor benefits but doesn't own operational execution.
