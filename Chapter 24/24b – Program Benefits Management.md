## Introduction

Six months into her digital transformation program, Sarah faced a challenging question from the CFO: "We've invested $8 million so far. What benefits have we realized?" Sarah's initial response focused on project deliverables: "We've launched the expense system, deployed the new platform, and completed user training."

But the CFO wasn't asking about outputs—she was asking about **benefits**. "I understand what you've delivered," the CFO clarified. "I want to know what value we've received. Are we saving money? Are we serving customers better? Are we more competitive? How do we know?"

This conversation transformed Sarah's understanding of program management. She realized that delivering projects on time and budget wasn't enough—programs exist to deliver **benefits**, not just outputs. Benefits management became the centerpiece of her program approach, guiding decisions, motivating teams, and demonstrating program value.

**Program benefits management** is the systematic process of identifying, defining, planning, tracking, and sustaining the benefits that justify program investment. This section explores how programs create and manage the value they're designed to deliver.
