## Introduction

When Sarah first proposed the digital transformation program, she faced a skeptical executive team. "We've already tried digital initiatives," the CIO noted. "What makes this different?" Sarah's response wasn't about technology—it was about strategy.

"This program isn't just about implementing new systems," she explained. "It's about fundamentally changing how we operate to compete in a digital marketplace. The expense system isn't an automation project; it's about empowering employees with modern tools. The mobile app isn't a software project; it's about meeting customers where they are. Together, these initiatives transform our business model."

This was the essence of **program strategy alignment**—connecting program outcomes directly to organizational strategy and ensuring that every component project contributes to strategic objectives.

**Program strategy alignment** is the first and most critical program performance domain. Without clear strategic alignment, programs risk delivering excellent outputs that don't create strategic value. This section explores how programs establish and maintain strategic alignment from conception through completion.
