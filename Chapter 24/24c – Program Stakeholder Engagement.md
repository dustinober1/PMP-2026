## Introduction

Three months into her digital transformation program, Sarah faced a stakeholder rebellion. The finance team was resisting the new expense system, claiming it didn't meet their requirements. The customer service department was concerned about the mobile app's impact on their roles. Even some executives were questioning whether the program was delivering value quickly enough.

"I thought everyone was on board," Sarah told her program sponsor. "We had buy-in at the beginning. What changed?"

Her sponsor's response was revealing: "Sarah, you're not managing a project—you're managing a program that affects the entire organization. Stakeholders aren't static; their needs, concerns, and influence evolve as the program progresses. You need systematic stakeholder engagement that addresses multiple levels, multiple projects, and changing circumstances."

This conversation marked Sarah's transition from project-thinking to program-thinking. She realized that **program stakeholder engagement** required a more sophisticated approach—coordinating engagement across multiple projects, managing stakeholder relationships over extended periods, and balancing competing interests across the organization.

**Program stakeholder engagement** is the systematic process of identifying stakeholders, understanding their needs and expectations, and developing strategies to engage them throughout the program lifecycle. This section explores how programs effectively manage stakeholder relationships to build support and ensure success.

## Stakeholder Relationship Management

### Conflict Management

**Stakeholder conflicts** are inevitable in complex programs. Effective conflict management prevents conflicts from derailing the program and can even strengthen relationships when handled well.

**Conflict Types**:

#### 1. Priority Conflicts
- **Resource Competition**: Different stakeholders competing for limited resources
- **Timeline Conflicts**: Different expectations for when benefits will be delivered

### Conflict Resolution Approaches

#### 1. Collaborating (Win-Win)
- **When to Use**: Issues are important, relationships are important, creative solutions possible
- **Approach**: Work together to find solutions that fully address all concerns
- **Example**: Business unit leaders disagree on feature priorities—facilitate workshop to find integrated solution

#### 2. Compromising (Partial Win)
- **When to Use**: Issues are moderately important, time-pressured, equal power
- **Approach**: Find mutually acceptable solutions that partially satisfy all parties
- **Example**: Finance and operations disagree on system access—develop compromised access levels

#### 3. Accommodating (Yield)
- **When to Use**: Issue is more important to others than to you, want to build goodwill
- **Approach**: Accept the other party's position or interests
- **Example**: Finance director requests additional reporting capability—agree to add to backlog

#### 4. Competing (Win-Lose)
- **When to Use**: Critical issues requiring decisive action, no room for compromise
- **Approach**: Assert your position, make decisions and move forward
- **Example**: Regulatory compliance requirement—non-negotiable implementation approach

#### 5. Avoiding (Withdraw)
- **When to Use**: Issue is trivial, emotions are high, cooling off needed
- **Approach**: Postpone discussion or decision
- **Example**: Minor feature disagreement during high-stress period—defer decision
