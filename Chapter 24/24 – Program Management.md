# Chapter 24 – Program Management

## Introduction

Sarah stood before the executive team, presenting the progress of her organization's digital transformation initiative. What began as a collection of related projects had evolved into something more complex—and more strategic—than she had initially envisioned. The expense reporting system was just one piece. The mobile app, the data platform, the process automation—each had its own deliverables, timelines, and teams. Yet none would deliver real value without the others.

This was Sarah's introduction to **program management**—the coordinated management of multiple related projects to achieve benefits that wouldn't be possible if managed separately. As the program manager for this digital transformation, Sarah found herself thinking beyond individual project deliverables to focus on strategic outcomes, coordinated benefits, and organizational change at scale.

Her challenge wasn't just technical integration; it was about ensuring that seven separate initiatives, with different teams, budgets, and timelines, would collectively deliver the organization's strategic objective: becoming a digitally-enabled, customer-centric enterprise.

This chapter provides comprehensive coverage of program management based on PMI's Standard for Program Management (Fifth Edition). You'll learn how programs differ from projects and portfolios, how to manage the five program performance domains, and how programs create strategic value through coordinated execution and benefits realization.

## Integration: Program Management as Strategic Coordination

Throughout this study guide, we've explored project management from individual project execution through portfolio alignment. Program management serves as the critical bridge between these levels, coordinating multiple related initiatives to achieve strategic outcomes.

**From Chapter 15 (Strategy and Portfolio Alignment)**: Programs are selected and prioritized within portfolios based on their strategic contribution. Chapter 24 builds on this by showing how programs translate portfolio strategy into coordinated action.

**From Chapter 3 (Value Delivery and Outcomes)**: Programs are fundamentally about delivering strategic value, not just project outputs. Chapter 24 demonstrates how benefits management ensures programs realize their intended strategic outcomes.

**From Chapter 6-9 (People Domain)**: Program leadership requires unique skills beyond project management. Chapter 24g explores how program managers must lead through influence, coordinate across multiple teams, and manage complex stakeholder relationships.

**From Chapter 10-14 (Process Domain)**: Programs integrate processes across multiple projects while maintaining appropriate governance and control. Chapter 24 shows how program management adapts and scales these processes for coordinated delivery.

**From Chapter 15-18 (Business Environment Domain)**: Programs operate within complex organizational and external environments. Chapter 24 demonstrates how programs maintain strategic alignment while responding to environmental changes and organizational dynamics.

## ECO Alignment

This chapter addresses the following tasks from the PMP Certification Exam Content Outline (ECO):

| Domain | Task | Coverage |
|--------|------|----------|
| Business Environment | Task 1: Plan and Manage Project Compliance | Primary |
| Business Environment | Task 3: Evaluate and Address External Business Environment Changes | Primary |
| Business Environment | Task 4: Evaluate and Deliver Organizational Value | Primary |
| Business Environment | Task 8: Monitor and Respond to External Environment | Primary |

**How This Chapter Covers the ECO Tasks:**

**Business Environment Task 1** (Plan and Manage Project Compliance) requires you to:
- Establish program governance structures that ensure compliance with organizational policies
- Develop program management plans that align with regulatory and legal requirements
- Coordinate compliance activities across multiple component projects
- Ensure program delivery meets organizational standards and controls

**Business Environment Task 3** (Evaluate and Address External Business Environment Changes) requires you to:
- Conduct environmental scanning to identify external factors affecting program success
- Adapt program strategy and approach in response to changing external conditions
- Coordinate responses to external changes across all program components

## The Program Management Context

### Programs vs. Projects vs. Portfolios

Understanding the distinctions between these three organizational structures is fundamental:

**Projects**:
- Temporary endeavors with defined start and end dates
- Focus on delivering specific outputs, products, or services
- Success measured by adherence to time, budget, and scope constraints
- Example: Developing an expense reporting system

**Programs**:
- Groups of related projects, subsidiary programs, and program activities
- Coordinated management to obtain benefits not available from managing individually
- Focus on delivering strategic outcomes and benefits
- Success measured by benefits realization and strategic value creation
- Example: Digital transformation program coordinating multiple related projects

**Portfolios**:
- Collections of projects, programs, subsidiary portfolios, and operations managed as a group
- Focus on achieving strategic objectives
- Success measured by overall strategic contribution and resource optimization
- Example: All digital initiatives across the organization

### Why Programs Matter

**Programs exist to**:
1. **Coordinate complexity**: Manage interdependencies and interfaces between related initiatives
2. **Realize strategic benefits**: Deliver outcomes that transcend individual project capabilities
3. **Optimize resources**: Share capabilities, infrastructure, and expertise across initiatives
4. **Manage change**: Coordinate organizational transformation across multiple workstreams
5. **Maintain strategic alignment**: Ensure coordinated execution remains focused on strategic objectives

### The Five Program Performance Domains

The Standard for Program Management organizes program management around five interrelated performance domains:

1. **Strategy Alignment**: Ensuring the program supports and aligns with organizational strategy and objectives
2. **Benefits Management**: Defining, creating, maximizing, and sustaining benefits
3. **Stakeholder Engagement**: Identifying, analyzing, and engaging stakeholders to build support
4. **Program Governance**: Providing oversight, decision-making, and control functions
5. **Program Life Cycle**: Structuring the program through definition, delivery, and closure phases

These performance domains interact throughout the program to ensure successful delivery of strategic outcomes. Each domain is covered in detail in this chapter's sections.
