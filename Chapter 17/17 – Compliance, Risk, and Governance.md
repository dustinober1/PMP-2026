## Introduction

Projects do not exist in a vacuum. They operate within a complex web of external laws, regulations, and internal organizational policies. Whether you are building a new office, launching a software product, or restructuring a company, you must navigate "must-do" requirements that aren't just about functionality—they are about legality, safety, and corporate responsibility.

In this chapter, we explore how project managers ensure their projects remain compliant and aligned with broader governance frameworks. We move beyond simple "tick-box" exercises to understand how compliance protects value and how governance empowers decision-making.

## Chapter Structure

*   **17a – Regulatory and Legal Compliance**: Navigating the landscape of external laws and regulations.
*   **17b – Data Privacy and Information Security**: Managing the critical risks of data protection in modern projects.
*   **17c – Organizational Policies and Standards**: Adhering to internal rules and quality standards.
*   **17d – Enterprise Risk and Governance Frameworks**: Aligning project risk with organizational appetite and governance structures.
*   **17e – Knowledge Check**: Scenario-based practice questions to test your understanding.

## The Learning Loop

As you work through this chapter, focus on:
1.  **Identification**: How do I know which rules apply to my project?
2.  **Integration**: How do I bake compliance into the schedule and WBS, rather than treating it as an afterthought?
3.  **Monitoring**: How do I ensure we stay compliant as the project evolves?

## ECO Alignment

This chapter addresses the following tasks from the PMP Certification Exam Content Outline (ECO):

| Domain | Task | Coverage |
|--------|------|----------|
| Process | Task 11: Manage Project Artifacts | Primary |
| Business Environment | Task 1: Plan and Manage Project Compliance | Primary |
| Business Environment | Task 3: Evaluate and Address External Business Environment Changes | Primary |

**How This Chapter Covers the ECO Tasks:**

**Process Task 11** (Manage Project Artifacts) requires you to:
- Document compliance requirements, decisions, and governance frameworks throughout the project
- Maintain records that demonstrate adherence to policies, standards, and legal requirements
- Create audit trails that show how compliance was addressed in project decisions
- Manage version control and configuration of compliance-related documentation
- Ensure project artifacts remain available and organized for future reference and audits

**Business Environment Task 1** (Plan and Manage Project Compliance) requires you to:
- Identify regulatory, legal, and organizational compliance requirements before project starts
- Integrate compliance requirements into project baselines, schedules, and quality standards
- Design processes that ensure ongoing compliance throughout the project lifecycle
- Understand how compliance requirements constrain project decisions and inform risk management
- Maintain governance structures that ensure compliance is monitored and verified

**Business Environment Task 3** (Evaluate and Address External Business Environment Changes) requires you to:
- Monitor changes in regulatory and legal environments that affect project compliance obligations
- Assess how external changes (new regulations, market conditions, security threats) impact compliance requirements
- Adapt compliance strategies when external conditions shift during project execution
- Understand how external risk factors (economic, political, technological) influence project governance
- Update project plans when external environment changes create new compliance imperatives

**Coverage in This Chapter:**

- **17a (Regulatory and Legal Compliance)**: Explains how to identify external regulatory and legal requirements and integrate them into project planning and execution
- **17b (Data Privacy and Information Security)**: Demonstrates compliance with increasingly important external regulations (GDPR, CCPA) and governance frameworks
- **17c (Organizational Policies and Standards)**: Shows how to identify and document internal compliance requirements and ensure adherence throughout project lifecycle
- **17d (Enterprise Risk and Governance Frameworks)**: Illustrates how governance frameworks ensure compliance, how external risks affect compliance strategy, and how to maintain governance as projects evolve
- Artifacts throughout: Project records, compliance documentation, governance decisions, and audit trails

Compliance is not a separate activity—it's integrated into how projects are planned, executed, and managed. This chapter shows how to make compliance an integral part of project governance rather than a box to check at the end.

### Recurring Themes in Our Scenarios

*   **Office Renovation (Predictive)**: Sarah's team must navigate strict building codes, zoning permits, and safety regulations (OSHA) before and during construction.
*   **Expense System (Agile)**: The team faces rigorous data privacy laws (GDPR/CCPA) because they are handling employee financial data. Compliance requirements often appear as "non-functional requirements" or constraints in the backlog.
*   **Transformation Program (Hybrid)**: This global initiative must align with labor laws in multiple countries and adhere to corporate governance standards for change management.
