## Introduction

Projects do not exist in a vacuum. They operate within a complex web of external laws, regulations, and internal organizational policies. Whether you are building a new office, launching a software product, or restructuring a company, you must navigate "must-do" requirements that aren't just about functionality—they are about legality, safety, and corporate responsibility.

In this chapter, we explore how project managers ensure their projects remain compliant and aligned with broader governance frameworks. We move beyond simple "tick-box" exercises to understand how compliance protects value and how governance empowers decision-making.

## Chapter Structure

*   **17a – Regulatory and Legal Compliance**: Navigating the landscape of external laws and regulations.
*   **17b – Data Privacy and Information Security**: Managing the critical risks of data protection in modern projects.
*   **17c – Organizational Policies and Standards**: Adhering to internal rules and quality standards.
*   **17d – Enterprise Risk and Governance Frameworks**: Aligning project risk with organizational appetite and governance structures.
*   **17e – Knowledge Check**: Scenario-based practice questions to test your understanding.

## The Learning Loop

As you work through this chapter, focus on:
1.  **Identification**: How do I know which rules apply to my project?
2.  **Integration**: How do I bake compliance into the schedule and WBS, rather than treating it as an afterthought?
3.  **Monitoring**: How do I ensure we stay compliant as the project evolves?

### Recurring Themes in Our Scenarios

*   **Office Renovation (Predictive)**: Sarah's team must navigate strict building codes, zoning permits, and safety regulations (OSHA) before and during construction.
*   **Expense System (Agile)**: The team faces rigorous data privacy laws (GDPR/CCPA) because they are handling employee financial data. Compliance requirements often appear as "non-functional requirements" or constraints in the backlog.
*   **Transformation Program (Hybrid)**: This global initiative must align with labor laws in multiple countries and adhere to corporate governance standards for change management.
