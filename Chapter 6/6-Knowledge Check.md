# Chapter 6 – Knowledge Check


After 2 sprints, the developer is more confident and contributing well. Sarah recognizes the progress: "You have made real improvement. I see you understanding the architecture and solving problems independently. Great growth."

This is servant leadership: Sarah addressed the issue but focused on helping the person succeed, not punishing them.

### 6.6.5 On the Exam: Servant Leadership and Coaching Scenarios

Exam questions test servant leadership by presenting scenarios where the PM needs to develop people or address challenges.

**Common question patterns:**

- *"A team member is struggling with their role. How do you help them improve?"*
- *"You want to develop a junior team member. How do you approach this?"*
- *"A team member is disengaged. What is your response?"*

**Red flag answers:**

- Focus only on the task, not the person
- Assume people know what to do without teaching them
- Punish people for struggling instead of helping them
- Make decisions for people instead of developing their capability

**Good answers:**

- Listen and understand the person's perspective
- Help people solve their own problems through coaching
- Delegate to develop people, even if it is not the most efficient short-term
- Address performance issues directly and fairly
- Invest in people's growth
- Create a safe, supportive environment where people can develop

## 6.7 Putting It All Together: Sarah's Leadership Evolution

By the end of her first three months managing multiple projects, Sarah's understanding of leadership has evolved dramatically.

**Sarah's office renovation project taught her:**
- Clarity about roles, authority, and decision-making prevents politics and misalignment
- You can lead people without direct authority if you build credibility and relationships
- Conflict needs to be addressed directly; avoiding it creates resentment

**Sarah's expense system project taught her:**
- Teams go through predictable stages of development; her job is to guide them through those stages
- Psychological safety allows conflicts to surface and be resolved
- Intrinsic motivation (autonomy, mastery, purpose) is more powerful than extrinsic rewards

**Sarah's transformation program taught her:**
- Leadership is about serving others, not commanding them
- Coaching and delegation develop people and build their capability
- Different groups need different leadership; she must adapt her approach

**Sarah's leadership philosophy (month 3):**
- Leadership is about enabling others to do their best work
- People are motivated by autonomy, mastery, and purpose
- Conflict is information, not failure; address it directly and collaboratively
- Authority comes from competence, fairness, and relationships, not just title
- My job is to serve the team and help them develop

This is the foundation for the chapters to come (Chapters 7-9), which will dive deeper into specific people leadership challenges: communication, decision-making, and influence at different levels.
