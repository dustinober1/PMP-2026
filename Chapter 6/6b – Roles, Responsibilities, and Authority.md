Teams eventually end. Adjourning is about closing well and capturing learning.

**Characteristics:**
- The project is coming to an end
- Energy may dip (the goal is in sight but not quite here)
- People may start looking toward the next thing
- Closure is important: recognizing contributions, capturing lessons, celebrating

**Sarah's role in Adjourning:**
- Create closure: "Here is what we accomplished. Here is what we learned."
- Celebrate: Recognize individual and team contributions
- Transition: Help people move to the next project or role
- Capture learning: Document what the team learned for future projects

### 6.1.4 Factors That Affect Team Development

Sarah learns that several factors can accelerate or slow team development:

**Accelerators:**
- **Clear goal and purpose**: The team understands why the work matters
- **Psychological safety**: People feel safe speaking up and being authentic
- **Diversity of thought**: Different perspectives lead to better problem-solving
- **Good leadership**: A leader who guides without dominating helps teams move through stages faster
- **Early wins**: Small successes build momentum
- **Continuity**: The same team members working together builds cohesion

**Decelerators:**
- **Ambiguous goal**: People are unsure what they are working toward
- **Lack of psychological safety**: People are afraid to speak up or make mistakes
- **Toxic team member**: One person who is disruptive, dismissive, or unwilling to collaborate
- **Weak leadership**: Leader is absent, defensive, or plays favorites
- **Frequent turnover**: New members keep the team in Forming
- **Organizational disruption**: Reprioritization, budget cuts, leadership changes disrupt the team's focus

### 6.1.5 Team Development Across Ways of Working

Sarah notices that team development looks different depending on the approach:

**In Predictive Projects (Office Renovation):**
- Team Forming happens upfront during planning
- Team is often distributed across organizations (contractor, internal, consultants)
- Storming may be less visible because roles are more formal and hierarchical
- The team may never reach full Performing because there is less daily interaction
- Focus is on clear roles, formal communication, and structured governance

**In Agile Projects (Expense System):**
- Team Forming happens in the first sprint (or even the first day)
- Storming happens early and often (because the team is together daily and decisions are made collaboratively)
- The team can move to Norming quickly (after 2-3 sprints) if the leader guides well
- Potential to reach Performing by mid-project
- Focus is on psychological safety, trust, and collaborative decision-making

**In Hybrid Projects (Transformation):**
- Program-level team (Steering Committee) forms separately from Design Team
- Design Team goes through full cycle (Forming → Storming → Norming → Performing)
- Pilot Teams also go through their own development
- Challenge: Coordinating across teams that are at different development stages
- Focus is on aligning different teams toward a common program goal

### 6.1.6 On the Exam: Team Development Scenarios

Exam questions test team development understanding by presenting a scenario at a particular stage and asking you to identify the best PM response.

**Common question patterns:**

- *"Your team is in the Storming stage with conflicts about priorities. What should you do?"*
- *"A new team member joined your Performing team. How do you integrate them?"*
- *"Team morale is low in the middle of the project. What might be happening?"*

**Red flag answers:**

- Avoid or suppress conflict
- Expect the team to be fully productive from day one
- Treat all conflicts the same (some are healthy; some are destructive)
- Do not adapt your leadership as the team develops

**Good answers:**

- Recognize what stage the team is in
- Respond appropriately to that stage
- Help the team move forward
- Build psychological safety
- Maintain focus on the goal

## 6.2 Roles, Responsibilities, and Authority: Establishing Clarity

Sarah learns that one of the most important things she can do is establish clarity: Who does what? Who makes what decisions? Who has authority over what?

Without clarity, team members waste energy on politics and misalignment instead of work.

### 6.2.1 The Importance of Clarity

Sarah experiences the cost of unclear roles directly:

**Example from Office Renovation:**

Three people are responsible for contractor oversight:
- PM (Sarah) is accountable for hitting the move-in date
- Facilities Manager is accountable for operational readiness
- Project Coordinator handles day-to-day scheduling and logistics

Early in the project, a critical decision arises: The contractor is behind schedule on structural work. Do they accelerate (costs more money) or slip the timeline?

- PM thinks: "That is my decision; I am accountable for the schedule"
- Facilities Manager thinks: "That affects when the building is operational; that is my decision"
- Project Coordinator thinks: "I need to schedule the move logistics; I should be involved in this decision"

No one is clear who should decide. Meetings happen. Email threads grow. The decision slips because no one wants to own it.

Finally, Sarah steps in and makes the call (with input from stakeholders): "We accelerate to hit the date. I am using my authority as Project Manager to make this call. Facilities Manager, I need your input on operational implications. Coordinator, I need you to adjust logistics plans."

Everyone respects the decision because Sarah was clear about authority.

**What would have happened with clarity:**

Sarah clarifies upfront:
- "I am accountable for schedule and cost. I make the final decision on trade-offs between them."
- "Facilities Manager, you are accountable for operational readiness. You advise on trade-offs that affect operations. I hear your input and consider it heavily, but I make the final call."
- "Coordinator, you are responsible for coordinating logistics. You handle scheduling based on my decisions."

When the schedule issue arises, people know:
- Who decides (PM)
- Who advises (Facilities Manager, CFO)
- Who implements (Project Coordinator, Contractor)

Decision happens faster. Less politics.

### 6.2.2 Role Definition: What Does This Person Do?

Sarah learns to define roles clearly by answering:

**The Role Statement: Three Parts**

1. **Title/Name**: What is the role called?
2. **Accountability**: What are you ultimately responsible for? What outcome are you accountable for?
3. **Key Responsibilities**: What are the main activities you will do?

**Example: Project Manager Role in Office Renovation**

**Title**: Project Manager

**Accountability**:
- Schedule: The move-in date is hit or clearly communicated why it will not be
- Cost: The project stays within budget or clearly communicates variance and options
- Scope: The building meets the agreed-upon specifications
- Quality: The space meets occupancy code requirements and is ready for move-in
- Stakeholder Alignment: Key stakeholders understand status and trade-offs

**Key Responsibilities**:
- Lead the planning process: Work with stakeholders to define scope, schedule, budget
- Manage the contractor: Weekly meetings, performance tracking, issue resolution
- Manage change: Review change requests, assess impact, escalate to CCB if needed
- Manage stakeholders: Regular updates, escalation of issues, expectation management
- Report status: Monthly reports to steering committee
- Manage risks: Monitor risks, escalate if mitigation is not working

**Example: Product Owner Role in Expense System**

**Title**: Product Owner (CFO in this case)

**Accountability**:
- The team is building the right thing: Features actually solve user problems
- Prioritization: The backlog is prioritized by value; high-value work is done first
- User satisfaction: Users are happy with the system and actually use it
- Business value: The system delivers the business benefits promised

**Key Responsibilities**:
- Define and maintain the product vision: "What are we building and why?"
- Manage the backlog: Prioritize items, add/remove based on learning, break down work
- Represent the user: Participate in design reviews, user testing, understand what users need
- Accept work: Decide when features are done and ready to ship
- Make trade-off decisions: When the team has more work than capacity, decide what to do

### 6.2.3 RACI and Decision Authority

Sarah uses a tool called RACI (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed) to clarify who does what for key activities.

**R – Responsible**: The person who does the work
**A – Accountable**: The person ultimately responsible for the outcome (there is usually one)
**C – Consulted**: People whose input is needed before the decision
**I – Informed**: People who need to know the decision but do not need to be involved

**Example: Office Renovation RACI for "Approve Scope Changes"**

| Activity | PM (Sarah) | Facilities Mgr | CFO | Contractor | Design Architect |
|----------|-----------|---|---|---|---|
| Identify change | R | I | I | R | C |
| Assess impact | R | C | C | C | C |
| Recommend decision | R | C | C | - | C |
| Approve/Deny | A | C | C | - | - |
| Communicate decision | R | - | - | R | - |
| Implement | - | R | - | R | - |

**What this means:**
- The Contractor or PM identifies when a scope change is needed (R for both)
- PM assesses the impact, consulting with others
- PM makes the recommendation
- PM is accountable for the decision (A) but seeks input from Facilities Manager, CFO, and Architect
- PM and Contractor communicate the decision
- Facilities Manager and Contractor implement the change

This clarity prevents politics and ensures alignment.

### 6.2.4 Decision Authority: Who Gets to Decide?

Sarah learns that there are different types of decisions, and different ways to make them:

**Decision Types and Authority:**

**Type 1: PM Decision**
- Decisions about how the work is done, day-to-day priorities, resource allocation
- Authority rests with the PM (in most cases)
- Example: "We will work 8-6 this week to catch up on schedule"
- Consult: Team members who are affected
- But ultimately: PM decides

**Type 2: Steering Committee Decision**
- Decisions about scope, timeline, budget, major risks
