**Consultative** (Leader gets input, then decides)
- When: The decision is important, different perspectives matter, you want buy-in
- Pros: Decision is informed by input, people feel heard, commitment is higher
- Cons: Slower than autocratic
- Example: "I am deciding how we allocate the budget. Let me hear from each of you about your priorities. [Listen.] Based on your input, I have decided to allocate X to this and Y to that."

**Collaborative** (Team decides together)
- When: The decision is within the team's domain, consensus is important, team commitment is critical
- Pros: Best decision if diverse perspectives matter, high commitment
- Cons: Slower, can feel unresolved if full consensus is not possible
- Example: "We need to decide how to structure the code. Developer A proposes X; Developer B proposes Y. Let's discuss the trade-offs. [Discuss.] Let's vote. [Majority wins.] We are going with X."

**Delegated** (Someone else decides)
- When: The decision is in someone else's domain, they have authority
- Pros: Empowers others, appropriate authority
- Cons: If the delegation is unclear, creates confusion
- Example: "Designer, you decide the visual style. I trust your judgment. Show me when you are ready."

**Sarah's decision style varies by situation:**

- **Budget allocation**: Consultative (she gathers input, then decides)
- **Technical approach in development**: Collaborative (the team decides)
- **Whether to accelerate schedule**: Autocratic (as PM, she makes this call based on Sponsor guidance)
- **What features to prioritize in next sprint**: Collaborative with the Product Owner (product owner leads; team provides input on feasibility)

### 6.3.4 On the Exam: Influence and Decision-Making Scenarios

Exam questions test influence and decision-making by presenting situations where the PM needs to get something done without direct authority.

**Common question patterns:**

- *"A stakeholder disagrees with your recommendation. How do you handle this?"*
- *"Two team members have a conflict about the technical approach. How do you resolve it?"*
- *"You need to get buy-in from a skeptical executive. How do you influence them?"*

**Red flag answers:**

- Use coercive power ("Do it because I said so")
- Make all decisions unilaterally without input
- Try to win the argument instead of understanding the other person
- Avoid the conflict or complain about people being difficult

**Good answers:**

- Understand the other person's perspective and priorities
- Build credibility through competence, honesty, and consistency
- Appeal to common ground
- Use facts and data
- Choose the right decision-making approach for the situation
- Know when to escalate
- Focus on solving the problem, not winning

## 6.4 Conflict Resolution and Problem-Solving: Addressing Friction Constructively

Sarah quickly learns that conflict is not something to avoid; it is something to address skillfully.

### 6.4.1 The Nature of Conflict

Conflict is a difference of opinion, priority, or approach where people have competing interests.

**Conflict is not inherently bad:**

In fact, healthy conflict can lead to better decisions and stronger teams.

- Different perspectives lead to exploring more options
- Debate forces you to defend ideas; weak ideas get eliminated
- People feel heard, which builds trust

**Conflict becomes destructive when:**

- It is avoided or suppressed, building resentment
- People attack each other personally instead of addressing ideas
- Power is used to force a solution instead of problem-solving
- One person dominates while others go silent
- The conflict is about individuals' egos instead of solving the problem

### 6.4.2 Common Types of Project Conflict

Sarah encounters different types of conflict across her projects:

**Schedule Conflict: "When will this be done?"**

Different stakeholders have different timeline expectations.

**Example (Office Renovation):**
- CEO wants to move in by Month 18 (it is tied to a press announcement)
- Facilities Manager worries that Month 18 is too tight; wants more buffer
- Contractor says Month 18 is achievable but tight; any delays will cascade

Sarah's approach:
1. Understand each person's perspective and the drivers behind it
2. Gather facts: What are the real dependencies? What risks are there?
3. Facilitate a conversation: "CEO, why is Month 18 critical? Facilities Manager, what is your concern? Contractor, what would give you more confidence?"
4. Explore options: Can we accelerate other work? Can we reduce scope? Can we accept some risk?
5. Make a decision: "We are committing to Month 18. Here is how we will manage the risk. If we slip, here is the impact. This is the best path forward."

**Resource Conflict: "Who should work on this?"**

Different work competes for the same resources.

**Example (Transformation Program):**
- The Finance person is on both the Design Team and a separate Financial Systems project
- Both projects need them full-time
- The Finance Lead (their manager) wants them on the Financial Systems project
- The Design Lead (Sarah) needs them for the Transformation Design

Sarah's approach:
1. Understand the business priorities: Which project is more important strategically?
2. Assess the impact: Can the Finance person work half-time on each? Can someone else do part of the Transformation work?
3. Escalate if necessary: If both projects are critical, escalate to senior leadership
4. Once a decision is made, communicate it clearly and help the person manage the transition

**Scope Conflict: "What should we build?"**

Different stakeholders want different scope.

**Example (Expense System):**
- CFO wants: Mobile app, receipt upload, cost center suggestions, approval workflow, reporting
- Developers say: We can do the first 4 in 6 sprints; reporting adds 2 more sprints
- Users want: Simple interface for submission; some do not care about reporting
- Finance wants: Audit trail and compliance features

Sarah's approach:
1. Clarify the requirements: Which features are must-haves vs. nice-to-haves?
2. Understand trade-offs: What is the impact of each scope decision (timeline, cost, user experience)?
3. Help people prioritize: What delivers the most value? What creates the most risk if left out?
4. Make a decision: "Phase 1 includes these features [list]. Phase 2 includes these features [list]."

**Technical Conflict: "How should we build this?"**

Different engineers have different opinions on the technical approach.

**Example (Expense System):**
- Developer A wants to use a microservices architecture (more complex, but more flexible long-term)
- Developer B wants to use a monolithic architecture (simpler now, but harder to scale)
- The Designer is concerned that either approach might make the UI complex

Sarah's approach:
1. Do not decide for them; let the team explore
2. Ask: "What are the trade-offs? How do we evaluate them? What matters most for our use case?"
3. Give them time for a spike or prototype to gather data
4. Help them decide: "Based on what you learned, which approach is better?"
5. Once decided, commit: "We are doing microservices. Let's move forward."

**Interpersonal Conflict: "I do not like working with this person"**

Sometimes people clash due to personality or working style differences.

**Example (Design/Developer relationship that got tense):**
- Designer feels the Developers are dismissing their ideas
- Developers feel the Designer does not understand implementation constraints
- Both are right; both are stressed

Sarah's approach:
1. Address it early: Do not let resentment build
2. Meet with each person individually: "I notice tension. What is your perspective?"
3. Facilitate a conversation: Bring them together with a facilitator (Sarah) in the room
4. Help them understand each other: "Designer, when you propose an idea without thinking through implementation, the Developers feel you are not considering their constraints. Developers, when you dismiss the design without explaining why, the Designer feels you are not valuing their expertise."
5. Help them agree on a new way of working: "Going forward, let's prototype ideas together before finalizing designs."

### 6.4.3 Conflict Resolution Approaches

Sarah learns that there are different approaches to resolving conflict, and the right one depends on the situation.

**Avoiding**
- You ignore or sidestep the conflict
- When: The conflict is minor, time is not available, the cost of addressing it is high
- Pros: Avoids immediate friction
- Cons: Resentment builds; the issue may resurface later
- Example: Someone makes a comment you do not like; you say nothing and move on

**Accommodating**
- You give in to what the other person wants
- When: The other person cares more about the issue than you do, the relationship is more important than the issue
- Pros: Builds goodwill
- Cons: Your needs are not met; can feel like a loss
- Example: "You want to use technology X; I prefer Y. But you care more about this, so let's use X."

**Competing**
- You push for your position
- When: You are confident you are right, speed is critical, an important principle is at stake
- Pros: Your needs are met; decision is made quickly
- Cons: Damages relationships; the other person feels unheard
- Example: "We are going live tomorrow; we use technology X no matter what."

**Compromising**
- Both sides give something up
- When: Both sides care equally, time is limited, a solution is needed but not perfect
- Pros: Both sides feel heard; decision happens
- Cons: Both sides may be unhappy (half a loaf); the solution may not be optimal
- Example: "You want X; I want Y. Let's do Z (a middle ground)."

**Collaborating**
- Both sides work together to find a solution that meets both needs
- When: Both sides care, creativity is possible, the relationship is important, time allows
- Pros: Best solution; both sides feel heard; relationship is strengthened
- Cons: Takes time
- Example: "You are concerned about time; I am concerned about quality. Let's find a way to deliver quality efficiently. [Discuss.] What if we build a simple version now and enhance later?"

**Sarah's conflict resolution philosophy:**

- Try to collaborate when possible (it builds relationships and often finds better solutions)
- Compromise when collaboration is not possible but both sides care
- Accommodate when the other person cares more or the relationship is more important
- Compete when speed or principle matters more than relationship
- Avoid only as a temporary measure; address important conflicts

### 6.4.4 Problem-Solving as a Team

Sarah learns that many conflicts are actually problems that need solving, not battles to win.

**The Problem-Solving Process:**
