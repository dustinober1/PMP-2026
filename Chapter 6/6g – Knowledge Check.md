### 6.g.1 Scenario-Based Questions

---

1. **Team Development and Leadership Approach:**

You are starting a new agile project with a team that has never worked together before. The first sprint planning meeting is coming up. Team members are polite but quiet, asking few questions. There is clear uncertainty about roles and how decisions will be made.

What should you do in this Forming stage?

A) Jump straight into detailed planning and assign work to each team member; people work best with clear direction
B) Create psychological safety by explaining the vision, clarifying roles, establishing norms, and introducing team members to each other
C) Let the team figure things out on their own; they will eventually self-organize
D) Focus on the work and assume team dynamics will take care of themselves

**Expected answer: B**

Explanation: The team is in the Forming stage—people are coming together but uncertain. Your role as a leader is to create psychological safety, clarify vision and goals, establish norms, and build trust. Option B does all of this. Option A assumes people will be productive immediately (they won't). Option C abandons the team. Option D ignores the team dynamics that will affect performance.

2. **Managing Conflict During Storming:**

You are managing the expense system project. In Sprint 3, the Designer and Developers have a heated disagreement. The Designer wants a complex, beautiful interface that takes time to build. The Developers want to use a standard framework to move faster.

Both have gone quiet in stand-ups, and you sense resentment. The tension is affecting team morale.

What should you do?

A) Side with the Developers since they are faster; tell the Designer to simplify the design
B) Side with the Designer since user experience is critical; tell the Developers to build what the Designer wants
C) Avoid addressing it directly; hope they work it out themselves over time
D) Facilitate a conversation where you understand both perspectives, explore trade-offs, and help them find a solution together

**Expected answer: D**

Explanation: This is conflict in the Storming stage. The appropriate response is to address it early and directly, understand both perspectives, and help the team collaborate on a solution. Option D does this. Options A and B take sides and ignore the other person's legitimate concern. Option C allows resentment to build and relationships to damage.

3. **Roles, Responsibilities, and Authority Clarity:**

You are managing the office renovation project. Three people are involved in a critical decision: should the project accelerate (costs more) or slip (misses the press date)?

- You (PM) think you should decide since you are accountable for schedule
- Facilities Manager thinks they should advise since they own operations readiness
- CFO thinks they should decide since they control the budget

Everyone has sent you emails with different opinions. The decision is stalling.

What should you do?

A) Make the decision yourself and announce it; you are the PM, so it is your authority
B) Call a meeting and vote; majority rules
C) Clarify authority upfront: You (PM) make the final decision on schedule/cost trade-offs, but you consult with Facilities Manager and CFO. Once decided, everyone implements their part.
D) Escalate to the Sponsor to make the decision; the conflict is too complex for you

**Expected answer: C**

Explanation: The root issue is lack of clarity about who decides what. Option C establishes that clarity. You should have done this upfront, but it is not too late. The PM is accountable for schedule and cost trade-offs, so you make the final call (with input). The Facilities Manager and CFO advise. Everyone knows their role. Option A makes the decision but without input. Option B treats this like a vote (not appropriate for authority). Option D unnecessarily escalates.

4. **Influence Without Direct Authority:**

You are leading the Design Team for the transformation program. The team includes senior people from HR, IT, Finance, and Operations—all more senior than you in their home organizations. They do not report to you.

You need them to prioritize the program work over their other responsibilities, but you have no direct authority over them.

How do you influence them?

A) Remind them that the program is a strategic priority and they have to do it
B) Build credibility through competent leadership, appeal to common ground (we all care about the transformation), use data to support recommendations, and make it easy for them to say yes by removing obstacles
C) Let them decide how much effort to put in; you cannot force them anyway
D) Escalate to their managers and ask them to force prioritization

**Expected answer: B**

Explanation: You build influence through competence, relationships, common ground, and removing obstacles—not through authority. Option B includes all of these. Option A relies on position power (which you do not have). Option C abandons your leadership role. Option D may be a last resort, but escalating should not be the first move.

---

5. **Motivation and Burnout Recognition:**

You are managing the expense system project. In Sprint 4, you notice the developers are working late, making small mistakes, and less collaborative in stand-ups. One developer even mentioned they might look for another project.

You pull team metrics: Team velocity is dropping, and morale scores dropped from 7.5 to 5.0.

What is likely happening, and what should you do?

A) The team is lazy; push harder to motivate them and meet the deadline
B) The team is burned out. Investigate the root cause (unsustainable pace, unclear purpose, lack of recognition). Address it by reducing scope, recognizing effort, or adjusting the pace.
C) The metrics are just noise; morale fluctuates; continue as planned
D) One person is disengaged; address it with that person individually and move on

**Expected answer: B**

Explanation: Multiple signals point to burnout: declining morale, mistakes, disengagement, dropping velocity. The appropriate response is to investigate and address root causes. Option B does this. Option A ignores the warning signs and will make things worse. Option C dismisses real data. Option D treats a symptom, not the cause.

---

6. **Servant Leadership and Coaching:**

A team member is struggling with perfectionism. They spent 3 days on a feature that should take 1 day because they keep refining the code. The feature is now blocking the sprint.

You want to help them improve without just telling them what to do.

What coaching approach should you use?

A) Tell them: "Stop perfecting. Ship the code by tomorrow. We need to move forward."
B) Use the GROW model: Ask about their Goal (what are they trying to achieve?), Reality (where are they now?), Options (what else could they try?), Will (what will they do?). Help them think through the situation and reach their own conclusion.
C) Assign them to pair with another developer to speed up their work
D) Move the feature to the next sprint; they are clearly not ready to deliver it

**Expected answer: B**

Explanation: This is a coaching opportunity. Option B uses the GROW model, which helps them reflect and decide. Option A tells them what to do (not coaching). Option C is a workaround. Option D avoids the development opportunity. The goal of coaching is to help people improve their own judgment and capability, not just solve the immediate problem.

---

7. **Integration: Leading Across Different Ways of Working:**

You are managing three concurrent projects with different approaches:

- Office Renovation (Predictive): Formal roles, clear hierarchy, less frequent team interaction
- Expense System (Agile): Small team, daily interaction, collaborative decision-making
- Transformation Program (Hybrid): Multiple teams at different stages of development, complex stakeholders

You realize that your leadership approach must differ across these projects. The style that works for the Expense System team (informal, collaborative, hands-on) might not work for the Office Renovation team (more formal, authority-based).

How do you adapt your leadership?

A) Use the same leadership style across all projects; consistency is important
B) Assess the context (team size, ways of working, stage of development, culture) and adapt your approach: More directive in Predictive projects, more collaborative in Agile, more facilitating in Hybrid programs. Build psychological safety in all contexts.
C) Let each team define the leadership style they want; you just follow their lead
D) Leadership is the same everywhere; do not overthink it

**Expected answer: B**

Explanation: Effective leaders adapt their approach to context. Option B correctly identifies that different contexts require different approaches. You remain true to your values (servant leadership, psychological safety, competence, fairness) but adapt how you lead. Option A ignores context. Option C abdicates leadership responsibility. Option D oversimplifies the complexity of leading in different environments.

## 6.g.8 Summary

Chapter 6 covers the people side of project management:

- **Team Composition and Development**: Build effective teams and guide them through Forming, Storming, Norming, and Performing stages. Recognize the characteristics of each stage and respond appropriately.
- **Roles, Responsibilities, and Authority**: Establish clarity upfront about who does what, who makes what decisions, and why. Use tools like RACI to prevent politics and misalignment.
- **Influence and Decision-Making**: Build influence through competence, relationships, common ground, and removing obstacles. Choose decision-making approaches that fit the situation (autocratic, consultative, collaborative, delegated).
- **Conflict Resolution**: Address conflicts early and directly. Understand both perspectives. Help the team see conflict as a problem to solve, not a battle to win. Facilitate collaborative solutions when possible.
- **Motivation and Engagement**: Understand what motivates people (autonomy, mastery, purpose). Build intrinsic motivation through meaningful work. Recognize signs of burnout and address root causes.
- **Servant Leadership and Coaching**: Lead by serving others' growth. Use coaching to help people improve their own judgment and capability. Delegate to develop people, not just to get things done.

The common thread: Leadership is fundamentally about understanding people, creating an environment where they can do their best work, and developing their capability.

In the next chapter (Chapter 7 – Communication and Stakeholder Engagement), we will dive deeper into how to communicate across teams, up to leadership, and with stakeholders to keep everyone aligned and engaged.
