# Chapter 6 – Building and Leading Teams

After three months managing projects with different ways of working (Chapter 4) and handling core project concepts (Chapter 5), Sarah makes a critical realization: *Everything comes down to people. I can have a perfect plan, excellent risk management, and clear scope, but if my team is not aligned, engaged, and working well together, nothing happens.*

This chapter focuses on the People Domain—specifically, how to build, develop, and lead teams that deliver results.

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:

- Assess team composition and understand stages of team development
- Define clear roles, responsibilities, and authority structures
- Influence and make decisions without relying on formal authority
- Navigate conflict and solve problems collaboratively
- Motivate and engage team members
- Practice servant leadership and develop others through coaching and mentoring
- Recognize how leadership approaches differ across ways of working (predictive, agile, hybrid)

These skills are not technical—they are fundamentally about understanding people and creating an environment where they can do their best work.

## Integration: Sarah's People Challenges

As Sarah moves from managing one project to three interconnected initiatives, her people challenges evolve:

**Office Renovation Team** (Predictive, ~30 people on contractor staff):
- Her core team is small (3 people: PM, Facilities Manager, Project Coordinator)
- She relies heavily on the contractor (General Contractor with their own team)
- Clear hierarchy and authority structure
- Limited direct influence over contractor staff—must lead through contracts and governance
- Challenge: How do you build team cohesion when the team is across organizations?

**Expense System Team** (Agile, ~5 core team members):
- She is the PM but the team includes: Product Owner (CFO), Designer, 2 Developers, QA
- Daily stand-ups, frequent interaction, informal culture
- She has more direct influence on team dynamics
- Challenge: How do you keep a small team motivated over 6 sprints? How do you handle disagreements quickly?

**Transformation Program** (Hybrid, ~15-20 people across program):
- Steering Committee (executives) at program level
- Design Team (8 people) defining new practices
- Pilot Teams (3 teams of 5-8 each) testing practices
- Sarah leads the Design Team and coordinates pilot teams
- Challenge: How do you lead diverse groups with different interests and perspectives? How do you build consensus across organizational boundaries?

By the end of Chapter 6, Sarah understands that her job is not just to manage work—it is to develop people, create psychological safety, make space for contribution, and build teams that are greater than the sum of their parts.

## 6.1 Team Composition and Development: Building the Right Team

Sarah learns that the first step to building a great team is understanding what makes a team effective, and then guiding that team through predictable stages of development.

### 6.1.1 What Makes a Team?

A team is a group of people organized to work together toward a common goal, with interdependent roles and shared accountability for results.

Notice the key elements:
- **Common goal**: Everyone is working toward the same outcome
- **Interdependent roles**: People rely on each other; they cannot do the work alone
- **Shared accountability**: Success or failure is collective, not individual

This is different from a "group" of people who happen to work on the same project but do not depend on each other.

**Example from Sarah's projects:**

- **Office Renovation**: The PM, Facilities Manager, and Coordinator are a team. They depend on each other; they share accountability for hitting the move-in date.

- **Contractor staff**: Are they a team? They work for the General Contractor, not directly for Sarah. From Sarah's perspective, they are an extended team or vendor relationship. But within the contractor's organization, they form a team.

- **Expense System**: The PM, Designer, 2 Developers, QA, and CFO are a team. They meet daily, depend on each other (designers cannot work without developers; QA cannot test without developers delivering code), and are collectively accountable for delivering a working expense system.

- **Transformation Design Team**: The 8 people designing new practices are a team. They have a shared goal (define the new way of working) and depend on each other (HR representative provides perspective on people implications; IT representative provides perspective on systems implications; etc.).

### 6.1.2 Team Composition: Who Should Be on the Team?

Sarah learns that the composition of a team matters enormously. Different types of team members bring different capabilities and perspectives.

**Functional Expertise**:
- People who know how to do the core work
- *Example (Expense System)*: Developers who can build the system, QA who can test it, Designer who can make it usable

**Cross-Functional Representation**:
- People from different disciplines or functions
- Brings diverse perspectives; reduces blind spots
- *Example (Transformation)*: HR (people perspective), IT (systems perspective), Finance (financial impact perspective), Operations (execution perspective)

**Subject Matter Expertise**:
- People who deeply understand a domain or problem
- *Example (Office Renovation)*: Architect (building design), General Contractor (construction methods), Facilities Manager (operations)

**Organizational/Political Representatives**:
- People who understand and can navigate organizational dynamics
- Can identify barriers and unlock resources
- *Example (Transformation)*: Executives on steering committee who can make decisions and remove obstacles

**New/Junior Members**:
- People with fresh perspectives who are developing expertise
- Bring energy and willingness to learn
- *Example (Expense System)*: One junior developer brings fresh ideas; senior developers mentor them

**Balanced Team Characteristics** (research from Belbin and others):

Teams are more effective when they have diversity of:
- **Skills**: Technical, interpersonal, leadership, creative
- **Perspectives**: Different backgrounds, experiences, ways of thinking
- **Personality types**: Some people are detail-oriented, others big-picture; some are risk-takers, others cautious
- **Seniority**: Mix of experienced and developing members

**Common Team Composition Mistakes:**

- **Too homogeneous**: Everyone thinks the same way; miss alternative perspectives
- **Too much seniority**: All veterans; no fresh energy; no room for development
- **Wrong functional mix**: Missing a critical skill or perspective
- **Weak link**: One person who cannot do their role; drags everyone down
- **No clear leader or leadership**: Everyone is equal; no one takes responsibility for outcomes

### 6.1.3 Tuckman's Stages of Team Development: The Journey

Sarah encounters a critical insight: Teams do not start out fully functional. They go through predictable stages, and Sarah's job is to guide them through those stages.

**Tuckman's model** describes four stages (later a fifth was added):

#### **Stage 1: Forming**

Team members are coming together. They are polite, excited, and uncertain.

**Characteristics:**
- People are getting to know each other
- Roles are not yet clear
- People are figuring out what the project is about
- There is optimism but also anxiety
- Productivity is low because people are still settling in

**Sarah's role in Forming:**
- Create psychological safety: "It is okay to ask questions, to not know everything, to admit mistakes"
- Clarify the vision and goals: "Here is where we are going"
- Establish norms: "Here is how we will work together"
- Introduce team members to each other: "Let me tell you about everyone's role"
- Begin building trust: One-on-ones, show genuine interest in people

**Example (Expense System, Sprint 1):**

Sarah brings the team together for the first time: PM (Sarah), CFO (Product Owner), Designer, 2 Developers, QA.

Not everyone has worked together before. The developers do not yet understand the design philosophy. The QA is unclear about what they are testing.

Sarah's Forming activities:
- First meeting: Introduce everyone, explain why they were chosen, what success looks like
- Establish the rhythm: Daily stand-ups at 10am, Sprint reviews Friday afternoons, Retros after reviews
- Build rapport: Ask people about their experience, what they like about their work, what they hope to get from this project
- Clarify roles: "CFO, you are the product owner—you make prioritization decisions. Designer, you are responsible for user experience. Developers, you own the code quality. QA, you own whether we are ready to release."
- Set expectations: "We are going to be transparent. Problems are not failures; they are information. When something does not work, we say it immediately."

**What Sarah does NOT do:**
- Assume people know each other or will figure things out on their own
- Expect immediate high productivity
- Let ambiguity about roles persist
- Ignore the awkwardness; name it and address it

#### **Stage 2: Storming**

Once teams start working together, conflicts emerge. Personalities clash, priorities compete, and frustrations surface.

**Characteristics:**
- Disagreements about how to work, priorities, or decisions
- People may push back against the leader or each other
- Cliques may form ("those developers" vs. "those testers")
- Frustration and even anger emerge
- Some people disengage or become passive-aggressive
- Productivity may drop

**Why Storming happens:**
- People are becoming more authentic and less polite
- Differences in style, perspective, or priority become visible
- People are testing boundaries: "Can I disagree? What happens if I push back?"
- The reality (how hard the work is, how different people are) sets in

**Sarah's role in Storming:**
- Do NOT avoid or suppress conflict; lean into it
- Listen to concerns without defending or dismissing
- Help the team see that conflict is normal and necessary
- Facilitate resolution: "I hear that you think we should use technology X and you think we should use Y. Let's talk about the trade-offs."
- Do not let conflicts fester or drive behavior (passive-aggressive comments, side conversations)
- Maintain clarity on the goal: "We may disagree on how, but we are unified on what we are trying to achieve"

**Example (Expense System, Sprint 2-3):**

Conflict #1: The Designer and Developers disagree on the UI approach.

Designer: "The interface should be simple and beautiful. Users should be able to understand it intuitively."

Developer: "That means writing complex code. We have limited time. Let's use a standard framework that is less beautiful but faster to build."

Sarah's response (Storming stage):
- Do NOT say: "Developers, build what the designer wants" (ignores the developer's concern) or "Designer, we do not have time for perfection" (ignores the user experience concern)
- DO say: "I hear both of you. Let's understand the trade-off. Designer, what is the user experience impact if we use a standard framework? Developers, what is the time savings? Can we find a middle ground?"
- The team explores: Maybe they use the standard framework but customize the styling. Maybe they build one complex feature beautifully and keep others simple. Maybe they invest time upfront to make it easier long-term.
- Resolution: The team agrees on an approach because they understand the reasoning, not because Sarah forced it

Conflict #2: The Product Owner (CFO) wants to prioritize a financial reporting feature. The Developers say it is too complex for the sprint.

Sarah's response:
- Do NOT say: "We have to do what the product owner says" (undermines the team's voice) or "It is too hard, we will not do it" (undermines the product owner's authority)
- DO say: "Product Owner, I understand the business value. Developers, I understand the complexity. Let's understand the gap. Can we do a smaller version this sprint and the full feature later? Can we simplify the approach?"
- The team problem-solves together: Maybe they deliver basic reporting this sprint and advanced filtering next sprint

**What Sarah does in Storming:**
- Address conflict early; do not let it build
- Create space for people to disagree with her and each other
- Help the team see that conflict is information, not failure
- Do not take sides; help the team find a solution
- Keep the focus on the goal, not on winning the argument

**What Sarah does NOT do:**
- Suppress conflict or tell people to "just get along"
- Avoid the team because the conflict makes her uncomfortable
- Always side with the loudest or highest-ranking person
- Let one person dominate or bully others

#### **Stage 3: Norming**

After working through conflicts, the team develops shared norms, processes, and a sense of identity.

**Characteristics:**
- The team has developed ways of working that feel natural
- Roles are clear and people respect each other's contributions
- Decision-making feels fair
- People support each other
- Productivity increases significantly
- There is a sense of "we"

**Sarah's role in Norming:**
- Reinforce the norms: "I see that we are all contributing in sprint planning. I see that we address issues directly instead of complaining to each other. That is how we want to work."
- Give the team autonomy: "You all know how to make good decisions. I trust you."
- Celebrate progress and small wins: "We shipped mobile responsiveness. That was good."
- Keep an eye on people who are still struggling: Sometimes a person never quite fits the team or is struggling with the change. Address it

**Example (Expense System, Sprint 4-5):**

The team has been working together for 8-10 weeks.

The norms are clear:
- Daily stand-ups are honest: People say what they are blocked on; they do not pretend everything is fine
- Code reviews are respectful but thorough: "I see a simpler way to write this, but I trust your approach" or "I think we should discuss this alternative"
- The Designer and QA are involved early in development, not just at the end
- The Product Owner prioritizes ruthlessly: "This is valuable, that is not—next sprint, next quarter, or never"
- The team owns the quality: They do not ship features they know are not ready, even if there is pressure to do so

Sarah's role:
- Less hands-on problem-solving; more trust
- Focus on removing obstacles: "You need access to the production database for testing? I will get that for you"
- Celebrate: "We have shipped 4 valuable features in 5 sprints. Users are actually using this system."

#### **Stage 4: Performing**

The team is highly functional and self-directed.

**Characteristics:**
- Team is autonomous; they solve problems without escalating to the leader
- People trust each other and do not need constant alignment
- High productivity and quality
- New members are quickly integrated
- The team takes pride in their work
- Conflicts are resolved within the team quickly

**Sarah's role in Performing:**
- Minimal day-to-day involvement
- Focus on strategic decisions, removing big obstacles, and developing people
- Help the team reflect and improve: "What have we learned? What should we do differently?"

**Example (Expense System, Sprint 6):**

The team is shipping consistently. The developers are making good architectural decisions without asking Sarah. The Designer and QA collaborate closely without Sarah mediating. The Product Owner is learning what the team can accomplish and is getting better at prioritization.

Sarah's focus:
- Reflecting with the team: "We have shipped a solid MVP. What did we learn about building products? What would you do differently next time?"
- Planning the next phase: "Phase 2 will add international support and accounting integration. What do we want to learn in this phase?"
- Developing people: "Developers, who is ready to take on a more senior role? Designer, how can we grow your skills?"

#### **Stage 5: Adjourning** (added later to the model)
