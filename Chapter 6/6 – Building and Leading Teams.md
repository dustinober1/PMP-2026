# Chapter 6 – Building and Leading Teams

After three months managing projects with different ways of working (Chapter 4) and handling core project concepts (Chapter 5), Sarah makes a critical realization: *Everything comes down to people. I can have a perfect plan, excellent risk management, and clear scope, but if my team is not aligned, engaged, and working well together, nothing happens.*

This chapter focuses on the People Domain—specifically, how to build, develop, and lead teams that deliver results.

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:

- Assess team composition and understand stages of team development
- Define clear roles, responsibilities, and authority structures
- Influence and make decisions without relying on formal authority
- Navigate conflict and solve problems collaboratively
- Motivate and engage team members
- Practice servant leadership and develop others through coaching and mentoring
- Recognize how leadership approaches differ across ways of working (predictive, agile, hybrid)

These skills are not technical—they are fundamentally about understanding people and creating an environment where they can do their best work.

## Integration: Sarah's People Challenges

As Sarah moves from managing one project to three interconnected initiatives, her people challenges evolve:

**Office Renovation Team** (Predictive, ~30 people on contractor staff):
- Her core team is small (3 people: PM, Facilities Manager, Project Coordinator)
- She relies heavily on the contractor (General Contractor with their own team)
- Clear hierarchy and authority structure
- Limited direct influence over contractor staff—must lead through contracts and governance
- Challenge: How do you build team cohesion when the team is across organizations?

**Expense System Team** (Agile, ~5 core team members):
- She is the PM but the team includes: Product Owner (CFO), Designer, 2 Developers, QA
- Daily stand-ups, frequent interaction, informal culture
- She has more direct influence on team dynamics
- Challenge: How do you keep a small team motivated over 6 sprints? How do you handle disagreements quickly?

**Transformation Program** (Hybrid, ~15-20 people across program):
- Steering Committee (executives) at program level
- Design Team (8 people) defining new practices
- Pilot Teams (3 teams of 5-8 each) testing practices
- Sarah leads the Design Team and coordinates pilot teams
- Challenge: How do you lead diverse groups with different interests and perspectives? How do you build consensus across organizational boundaries?

By the end of Chapter 6, Sarah understands that her job is not just to manage work—it is to develop people, create psychological safety, make space for contribution, and build teams that are greater than the sum of their parts.
