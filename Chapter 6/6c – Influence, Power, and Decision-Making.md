- Authority rests with the Sponsor or Steering Committee
- Example: "Do we accelerate the project (spend more money) or slip the timeline?"
- PM recommends; Steering Committee decides
- PM must present options and the trade-offs clearly

**Type 3: Team Decision**
- Decisions about how to solve a technical or design problem
- Authority rests with the team (or team leads in their domains)
- Example: "How should we structure the code to handle multiple currencies?"
- PM does not dictate the solution; the team decides
- PM might say: "We have 2 weeks to solve this. Show me options and trade-offs. You decide the best approach."

**Type 4: Shared Decision**
- Decisions that affect multiple groups; consensus is needed
- Example: "Should we use Agile or Predictive for Phase 2?"
- Process: Get input from all parties, help them understand trade-offs, facilitate alignment
- If consensus is not possible: PM or Sponsor makes the call

### 6.2.5 Authority Without Direct Power

Sarah faces a critical challenge: In her office renovation project, she is the Project Manager, but the contractors are not her direct reports. She does not have direct power over them.

Yet she still needs to ensure they perform.

**How Sarah leads the contractors:**

1. **Contractual Authority**: The contract defines scope, schedule, quality, and penalties for non-performance. This is real authority.

2. **Earned Authority**: Sarah has expertise and credibility. The contractor respects her technical knowledge and fair judgment.

3. **Relationship**: Sarah is professional and respectful. She does not blame; she problem-solves. The contractor wants to work well with her.

4. **Clear Alignment**: The contractor knows what success looks like and that Sarah will measure fairly.

5. **Escalation Authority**: When needed, Sarah escalates to the Sponsor or Steering Committee, which has power over the contractor's contract.

**Sarah's approach to contractor management:**

- Weekly meetings with clear agendas: Status, risks, issues, coming challenges
- Transparent tracking: Schedule, budget, quality against targets
- Early problem-solving: When issues emerge, address them immediately rather than letting them fester
- Respect for constraints: If the contractor faces a genuine constraint, help problem-solve instead of blaming
- Fair negotiations: When disputes arise, present facts and reason through them rather than using power

This is not "leading" in the traditional sense, but it is effective influence.

### 6.2.6 On the Exam: Roles and Authority Scenarios

Exam questions test roles and authority understanding by presenting scenarios where clarity is lacking or roles conflict.

**Common question patterns:**

- *"A stakeholder is trying to assign work directly to a team member, bypassing you. How do you handle this?"*
- *"Two people think they should make a particular decision. How do you resolve this?"*
- *"A contractor is not meeting their responsibilities. What is your approach?"*

**Red flag answers:**

- Ignore the clarity issue and hope it resolves itself
- Assert authority aggressively without building relationship
- Make all decisions yourself (disempowers the team)
- Let people operate without clarity about who is responsible for what

**Good answers:**

- Establish clarity upfront about roles and authority
- Help people understand the reasoning behind decisions
- Make different types of decisions differently (some PM, some team, some steering committee)
- Build authority through competence and relationships, not just title
- Address role conflicts directly and quickly

## 6.3 Influence, Power, and Decision-Making: Leading Without Direct Authority

Sarah discovers that the most important leadership skill is influence. She does not always have direct authority, yet she still needs to get things done.

### 6.3.1 Sources of Power and Influence

According to research by French and Raven, there are several sources of power:

**Legitimate Authority** (Position Power)
- You have formal authority due to your title
- "I am the Project Manager; I make this decision"
- Works: When people respect hierarchy and the organization backs you
- Limitation: People follow orders, but they do not go the extra mile

**Expert Power** (Competence)
- You have deep knowledge or skill that people need
- "I have done this 10 times; I know the best approach"
- Works: People trust your judgment and seek your input
- Limitation: Must continuously prove your expertise; can be threatened by smart team members

**Referent Power** (Relationship/Respect)
- People like and respect you; they want to help you succeed
- "Sarah cares about me, and I care about her"
- Works: People go above and beyond for people they like
- Limitation: Must continuously build and maintain relationships

**Reward Power** (Incentives)
- You control things people want (bonuses, promotions, interesting assignments)
- "I will assign you the high-visibility project if you deliver this one well"
- Works: People are motivated by rewards
- Limitation: Incentives can backfire if perceived as manipulation; does not build intrinsic motivation

**Coercive Power** (Penalties)
- You can punish people (reprimand, poor review, remove from project)
- "If you do not perform, there will be consequences"
- Works: People avoid negative consequences
- Limitation: Creates fear, not commitment; people do the minimum to avoid punishment; damages relationships

**Information Power** (Access to Information)
- You have access to information people need
- "I know what the Sponsor is planning; I know how this connects to strategy"
- Works: People see you as the bridge to leadership; they listen to you
- Limitation: Must continuously provide valuable information; people resent being kept in the dark

**Sarah's Power Profile:**

**Office Renovation:**
- Legitimate Authority: High (she is the PM; the organization backs her authority)
- Expert Power: Medium-High (she knows project management; but contractors have more construction expertise)
- Referent Power: Building (she is fair and respectful; people like working with her)
- Reward/Coercive Power: Limited (she does not control contractor pay or employment)
- Information Power: High (she knows the overall strategy and constraints; contractors focus on their piece)

**Expense System:**
- Legitimate Authority: Medium (she is PM, but product owner has authority over scope)
- Expert Power: Medium (she knows project management, but team members have deeper technical expertise)
- Referent Power: High (the team is small; she builds strong relationships)
- Reward/Coercive Power: Limited (HR controls pay and reviews; Sarah influences but does not control)
- Information Power: High (she knows the strategy, constraints, and user needs)

**Transformation Program:**
- Legitimate Authority: Medium (she is Design Lead, but Steering Committee has final authority)
- Expert Power: Medium (she knows how to design processes, but pilot teams are the experts in their work)
- Referent Power: Building (she is learning to build trust across the organization)
- Reward/Coercive Power: Low (people are not on her team formally)
- Information Power: High (she is the bridge between pilots, design team, and steering committee)

### 6.3.2 Building and Using Influence Effectively

Sarah learns practical strategies for influence:

**1. Understand the Other Person**

Before trying to influence someone, understand their perspective, priorities, and constraints.

- What is important to them?
- What are their concerns?
- What are their constraints (time, budget, resources)?
- What would success look like for them?

**Example (Contractor in Office Renovation):**

The contractor wants:
- Clear specifications (so they do not get blamed for misunderstandings)
- Timely decisions and approvals (so they are not waiting)
- Fair payment (on time, as agreed)
- Reasonable change management (changes happen, but there is a process)

Sarah's approach to influence: "I will give you these things. In return, I expect quality work, proactive communication about risks, and solutions when issues arise."

This is influence based on understanding.

**2. Build Credibility**

People are influenced by people they trust and respect.

- Be competent: Do your job well
- Be honest: Admit when you do not know something; follow through on what you say
- Be fair: Make decisions based on facts, not favoritism
- Be consistent: Do not say one thing to one person and another thing to someone else

**Example (Design Team in Transformation):**

Sarah is leading the Design Team, but most members are more senior than her in their home organizations.

She builds credibility by:
- Coming prepared to meetings: "Here is what we learned from the pilot last week; here are the questions we should explore"
- Synthesizing diverse perspectives: "I hear X from operations and Y from finance. Here is how I think about the trade-off"
- Making strong recommendations: Not "what do you think?" but "based on what we have learned, I recommend we do X. Here is why. What am I missing?"
- Following through: When she says she will investigate something, she does; when she commits to a timeline, she delivers

Over time, the team respects her judgment and listens to her recommendations.

**3. Appeal to Common Ground**

Find what you and the other person both care about, and build from there.

**Example (Developers and Designer disagreement):**

Both care about: Users being happy, the product shipping, the team being proud of the work.

Sarah's approach: "I know you both care about users and shipping a great product. You are prioritizing different things (code simplicity vs. user experience beauty). Let's find a way to serve both values."

This is more effective than: "Designer, you need to accept the developer's approach" (which makes the developer feel heard but the designer feel dismissed).

**4. Use Data and Facts**

When you have data, use it. People are more influenced by facts than by opinion.

**Example (Expense System delivery date):**

When the Product Owner wants to add features but the team says they cannot deliver them in the planned timeline, Sarah brings data:
- Team velocity: 8 story points per sprint
- Current backlog: 50 story points
- Sprints remaining: 2
- Therefore: Team can complete ~16 story points

"Based on our velocity, we can deliver these features [list]. We cannot deliver these features [list] in the remaining time. If we try to do everything, we will slip the date or sacrifice quality."

Facts make the conversation clear.

**5. Make it Easy to Say Yes**

Remove obstacles that prevent people from saying yes to what you want.

**Example (Getting contractor buy-in to accelerated schedule):**

Contractor is concerned about acceleration: "We need more resources and it will cost more."

Sarah's approach to make it easy to say yes:
- "I understand the cost impact. I have discussed with the CFO; there is budget for acceleration."
- "What resources do you need? I will help you get them."
- "What are your risks? Let's problem-solve them."

Now it is easy for the contractor to say yes: "Okay, we can accelerate."

Without this, the contractor would say: "We need approval and resources that we do not have; it is too hard to do this."

**6. Know When to Escalate**

Sometimes, you cannot influence someone directly. It is time to escalate.

**When to escalate:**
- The decision is above your authority level
- You have tried to influence and it is not working
- The issue is blocking critical work
- The other person is not open to influence

**How to escalate effectively:**
- Do not complain; explain the situation and the impact
- Show what you have already tried
- Propose a solution or decision
- Do not undermine the person you are escalating about

**Example (Contractor overrun on foundation):**

Foundation work is 15% over budget and running behind schedule.

Sarah first addresses it directly with the contractor: "I see we are over budget and behind schedule. Let's understand why. Is this a temporary variance or a structural issue? What can we do to get back on track?"

Contractor says: "We discovered more soil issues than expected. We are addressing them. We will absorb some costs, but we will need approval for some additional budget."

Sarah escalates to the Sponsor: "The foundation has discovered additional issues. The contractor is addressing them. They are absorbing some costs but need approval for an additional $50K. Here is the impact on timeline and budget. I recommend we approve this because the foundation cannot be skipped or rushed. Delaying the decision will cost more."

Sponsor approves the additional budget.

This is effective escalation: Sarah has done the work, understands the issue, and asks the Sponsor to make a decision that is above her authority.

### 6.3.3 Decision-Making Approaches

Sarah learns that there are different ways to make decisions, and good leaders choose the right approach for the situation.

**Autocratic** (Leader decides alone)
- When: Time is critical, expertise is clear, people are okay with this style
- Pros: Fast, clear
- Cons: People feel unheard, commitment is lower
- Example: "We are going live tomorrow. I have decided we will do X."
