- Mismatch between values and work: Having to do things that conflict with what you believe

**Sarah's approach to preventing burnout:**

1. **Sustainable pace**: No regularly working 60+ hour weeks. If the work requires it, something is wrong (bad estimate, scope creep, insufficient resources).

2. **Recognition**: Acknowledge effort and progress publicly. "You put in a lot of work on this feature; thank you."

3. **Autonomy and control**: Let people have input on decisions that affect them.

4. **Alignment with values**: Help people see how their work connects to what they care about.

5. **Growth**: Help people develop and not feel stuck.

6. **Fairness**: Make sure similar effort gets similar recognition and compensation.

**Example from Expense System:**

In Sprint 4, Sarah notices that the developers look tired. They are working late, making small mistakes, not as collaborative in stand-ups.

Sarah addresses it:
- Asks individually: "How are you doing? Are you tired? Is something wrong?"
- Discovers: The team is carrying too much work; they are not finishing features and moving incomplete features to the next sprint
- Takes action: "Let's reduce the sprint scope. I would rather you deliver fewer features really well than many features that are half-done. Let's talk about what is actually critical."
- Follows through: Next sprint, the team delivers less but it is high quality, and people are less stressed
- Recognizes: "Thank you for being honest about the pace. This team is delivering great work at a sustainable pace."

### 6.5.5 On the Exam: Motivation and Engagement Scenarios

Exam questions test motivation understanding by presenting scenarios where team engagement is low.

**Common question patterns:**

- *"Team morale is low, and people seem disengaged. What might be the cause, and how would you respond?"*
- *"A strong team member is saying they want to leave the project. What do you do?"*
- *"The team has been working hard for months, and burnout is showing. How do you address this?"*

**Red flag answers:**

- Ignore the disengagement and focus only on deadlines
- Assume money is the only motivator
- Blame the team for not being motivated
- Push harder to meet deadlines even as people burn out

**Good answers:**

- Recognize signs of disengagement or burnout early
- Understand the root cause (lack of autonomy, unclear purpose, unsustainable pace, lack of recognition, unfair treatment)
- Address the root cause, not just the symptom
- Help people find meaning and connection to the work
- Support sustainable pace
- Recognize contributions and progress

## 6.6 Servant Leadership and Coaching: Leading by Serving Others

Sarah's understanding of leadership evolves through a key realization: *My job is not to command; it is to serve the team.*

### 6.6.1 Servant Leadership: A Different Model

Servant leadership is a model where the leader's primary focus is on serving and developing the team, not on wielding power or getting credit.

**Servant Leadership Principles:**

**1. Listen Deeply**
- The leader listens more than talks
- The leader seeks to understand the other person's perspective
- The leader does not dismiss or interrupt

**Sarah's approach:**
- One-on-ones: Regular check-ins where she asks: "How are you doing? What are you working on? What do you need?"
- Listens without interrupting
- Takes notes
- Follows up: "Last week you mentioned X; I wanted to follow up on that"

**2. Empathy**
- The leader tries to understand the other person's feelings and perspective
- The leader does not assume; they ask

**Sarah's approach:**
- When a team member is struggling: "This seems hard. Talk me through what you are experiencing."
- When a conflict arises: "I can see why you feel that way. Tell me more."
- Validates feelings: "I hear that you are frustrated. That makes sense."

**3. Healing**
- The leader helps people work through hurt or damage (from previous bad experiences, team conflict, organizational wounds)
- The leader creates a space where people can be vulnerable and recover

**Sarah's approach:**
- When someone has been hurt by a previous bad experience: "I hear that last project was really hard. I want to do things differently this time."
- Creates psychological safety: People know they can make mistakes and recover
- Addresses harm directly: If Sarah makes a mistake or hurts someone, she acknowledges it and apologizes

**4. Awareness**
- The leader is aware of themselves (strengths, weaknesses, impact on others)
- The leader is aware of the team (dynamics, needs, capabilities)

**Sarah's approach:**
- Seeks feedback: "How am I doing? What could I do differently?"
- Reflects: "That meeting did not go well. What did I miss?"
- Adjusts: "I realize I have been making too many decisions. I should involve the team more."

**5. Persuasion (Not Authority)**
- The leader persuades rather than commands
- The leader explains reasoning; people understand why
- People choose to follow because they understand, not because they have to

**Sarah's approach:**
- Explains decisions: "Here is the challenge we face. Here is why I am recommending this approach. What do you think?"
- Listens to pushback: "I hear you think X is a better approach. Tell me more."
- Decides: "I have heard your perspective. I am going with Y, and here is why. I know you may not fully agree, but I hope you can commit to making this work."

**6. Conceptualization**
- The leader thinks beyond day-to-day work
- The leader helps people see how their work connects to something larger
- The leader develops vision, not just tactics

**Sarah's approach:**
- "This expense system is part of our transformation to a more efficient, data-driven organization"
- "This new way of working is about building a collaborative culture"
- Helps people understand the "why" beyond the immediate deliverable

**7. Stewardship**
- The leader takes responsibility for the team and the work
- The leader does not avoid difficult decisions
- The leader is accountable, and they hold others accountable fairly

**Sarah's approach:**
- Takes responsibility: "This project is my accountability. If we fail, that is on me."
- Holds people accountable: "You committed to delivering X. Let's talk about why that did not happen."
- But does not blame: "I see that the timeline estimate was wrong. That is my responsibility to catch and adjust. How can we fix this?"

**8. Commitment to Growth of Others**
- The leader sees their job as developing people
- The leader invests in people's growth, even if they will leave the project or organization
- The leader is not threatened by people getting better or moving on

**Sarah's approach:**
- Intentionally develops people: "What skills do you want to develop? Let's find opportunities."
- Gives challenging work: "This will stretch you. I will be here to support you."
- Celebrates promotions and growth: When a team member gets a promotion or opportunity, Sarah is genuinely happy
- Does not punish people for leaving: When someone leaves the project for a better opportunity, Sarah helps them transition smoothly

### 6.6.2 Coaching and Mentoring: Developing People

Sarah learns that servant leadership includes actively developing people through coaching and mentoring.

**Coaching**: Helping someone improve their performance in their current role
- Example: A developer is struggling with code review feedback. Sarah coaches them: "Tell me what you are hearing in the feedback. How would you respond? Let's discuss alternatives."

**Mentoring**: Helping someone develop for future growth
- Example: A junior developer wants to become a tech lead. Sarah mentors them: "Here is what a tech lead does. Let's work on building that capability."

**The Coaching Conversation: GROW Model**

**G – Goal**: What does the person want to achieve?
- "What are you trying to accomplish?"
- "What would success look like?"

**R – Reality**: Where are they now?
- "What is the current situation?"
- "What have you tried so far?"

**O – Options**: What are the possibilities?
- "What else could you try?"
- "What have you seen other people do in this situation?"
- "What if we approached it differently?"

**W – Will**: What will they do?
- "Which option feels right to you?"
- "What is your next step?"
- "When will you do it?"
- "How will I know you did it?"

**Example: Developer Struggling with Perfectionism**

**Goal**: Sarah asks: "What are you trying to accomplish? You seem to be investing a lot of time in this feature."

Developer: "I want to make it perfect. I do not want to ship code with bugs."

Sarah: "I appreciate that. What does 'perfect' mean to you?"

Developer: "Clean code, no bugs, elegant solution."

**Reality**: Sarah asks: "Where are you now? How is it going?"

Developer: "I have been working on this for 3 days. I keep finding things to improve. I am not ready to ship it."

Sarah: "What is the impact of that? The feature is blocking the sprint."

Developer: "I know. I feel bad, but I cannot ship it until it is right."

**Options**: Sarah asks: "What else could you do? What if we thought about this differently?"

Developer: "I could ship it with known limitations?"

Sarah: "What would 'good enough' look like? Not perfect, but good enough?"

Developer: "It works. No critical bugs. Maybe some edge cases I have not handled."

Sarah: "That sounds reasonable. What else could you do?"

Developer: "I could ship it and handle edge cases in the next sprint based on user feedback?"

Sarah: "That is interesting. What is the trade-off?"

Developer: "I ship faster, but there is a small risk of bugs. However, users will give me real feedback, and I can prioritize the most important issues."

Sarah: "What do you think?"

Developer: "That actually makes sense. It is scary, but the team can review before shipping."

**Will**: Sarah asks: "What will you do?"

Developer: "I will clean up the code for review. Get feedback from the team. Ship it this sprint."

Sarah: "When?"

Developer: "By end of day tomorrow."

Sarah: "How will I know it is ready?"

Developer: "You will see it in code review and in the demo."

Sarah: "Great. And after shipping, what?"

Developer: "I will monitor for issues and handle edge cases in Phase 2 if users report them."

**Follow Up**: Sarah follows up: "How did shipping that feature feel? Any issues?"

Developer: "It was good. I learned that perfect is the enemy of done. Users have been happy; no major bugs."

Sarah: "That is a valuable lesson. It also helps the team move faster. As you get more senior, this balance between quality and speed is something good leaders manage."

This is coaching: Sarah did not tell the developer what to do. She helped them think through the situation and reach their own conclusion.

### 6.6.3 Delegation: Empowering Others

Sarah uses delegation as a form of development and empowerment.

**Effective Delegation:**

**1. Choose the Right Person**
- Not based on who is least busy (they might be busy with other important work)
- Based on: Where they can grow, what the work requires, what capacity they have
- Example: Sarah delegates a stakeholder communication task to a junior PM. It stretches them but is doable with support.

**2. Clarify the Task**
- What is the outcome? What is the final deliverable?
- What authority do they have? Can they make decisions, or do they need to check with you?
- What are the constraints? Budget, timeline, scope?
- What is success?

**Example**: "I need you to lead the design phase for Phase 2. The outcome is a detailed design document and stakeholder buy-in. You can make design decisions; I need to approve before we implement. Timeline is 4 weeks. Success is that the design is aligned with the vision and stakeholders understand the approach."
