1. **Define the Problem**
   - Not: "Developers do not respect design decisions"
   - But: "The design team is proposing interfaces that the developers say require 4x more development effort; the design team feels the developers are blocking good design"
   - Be specific and factual

2. **Understand Root Causes**
   - Why is the developer concerned about effort?
   - Why is the designer concerned about the interface?
   - Often, the real issue is not the surface conflict but the unmet need behind it

3. **Generate Options**
   - Brain storm together: What are possible solutions?
   - Do not evaluate yet; just generate
   - Example options: More collaboration upfront, design prototypes before implementation, simpler interfaces, phased implementation

4. **Evaluate Options**
   - For each option: What are the trade-offs?
   - Which option best serves the team's goals?

5. **Decide and Commit**
   - Make a clear decision
   - "We are going to do X. Here is why. Let's commit to making this work."

6. **Follow Up**
   - Check in: Is the solution working?
   - Adjust if needed

**Example: Design/Developer Collaboration Problem**

**Definition**: Design and Development have different approaches to timeline and quality. Designers want to explore multiple options; Developers want to move fast.

**Root Causes** (discovered through conversation):
- Designers worry that fast development will miss design opportunities
- Developers worry that extensive design will slow them down and create rework
- Both are right: Some design upfront is needed, but endless design slows delivery

**Options Generated**:
1. Designers do all design upfront (Developers' preference) → But misses learning from development
2. Designers design as developers build (Designers' preference) → But creates rework
3. Designers do design spikes early in sprint; developers implement based on spikes; designers refine based on implementation
4. Different approach for different features: Complex features get more design; simple features get less

**Decision**: "We will do design spikes at the start of each sprint. Designers will spend 2-3 days exploring the design. Developers will implement based on that design. During implementation, designers are available to refine based on what we learn. This gives us both design quality and development speed."

**Follow Up**: "After Sprint 2, let's review: Is this balance working? Are we happy with quality and pace?"

### 6.4.5 Psychological Safety and Conflict

Sarah learns that conflict resolution depends on psychological safety. If people do not feel safe speaking up, conflicts go underground.

**Psychological Safety**:
- People believe that if they speak up with an idea, question, or concern, they will not be punished or humiliated
- They can take interpersonal risks without fear of negative consequences

**Sarah builds psychological safety by:**
- Admitting her own mistakes: "I made a bad call on that. Here is what I learned."
- Asking questions instead of asserting: "What do you think about this approach?" instead of "Here is how we should do this"
- Responding well to bad news: When someone raises a problem, Sarah says "Thank you for bringing this up" instead of "Why did not you catch this earlier?"
- Protecting people who dissent: When someone disagrees in a meeting, Sarah does not punish them later
- Following through on promises: If Sarah says "I will think about that," she does; she does not dismiss the idea

With psychological safety, conflicts emerge and are resolved. Without it, conflicts go underground and fester.

### 6.4.6 On the Exam: Conflict Resolution Scenarios

Exam questions test conflict resolution by presenting a conflict and asking how the PM should respond.

**Common question patterns:**

- *"Two team members are in conflict about the technical approach. How do you handle this?"*
- *"A stakeholder disagrees with a decision you made. How do you respond?"*
- *"Team morale is low because of a conflict that has not been addressed. What should you do?"*

**Red flag answers:**

- Avoid the conflict or hope it goes away
- Use authority to force one side to comply
- Take sides without hearing both perspectives
- Punish the person who raised the conflict

**Good answers:**

- Address conflicts early and directly
- Understand both perspectives
- Help the team see the conflict as a problem to solve, not a battle to win
- Facilitate a collaborative solution when possible
- Make a clear decision if collaboration does not work
- Follow up to ensure the solution is working
- Build psychological safety so conflicts surface early

## 6.5 Motivation and Engagement: Keeping Teams Energized

Sarah learns that even if roles are clear, relationships are strong, and conflicts are resolved, people still need to feel motivated and engaged.

### 6.5.1 What Motivates People?

Sarah notices that different people are motivated by different things.

**Traditional View**: People are motivated by money, titles, and security.

Research shows it is more complex than that.

**Daniel Pink's Research** identifies three key motivations:

**1. Autonomy**: People want to have control over their work
- They want to choose how they do their work
- They want to have input on decisions that affect them
- They do not want to be micromanaged

**Sarah's approach to autonomy:**
- Agile projects: Daily stand-ups where people report their progress and raise blockers; Sarah does not tell them what to do
- Predictive projects: Assign tasks based on skills; let people figure out how to complete them
- Check in for blockers: "What do you need to move forward?"
- Trust them: "I trust your judgment; you decide how to approach this"

**2. Mastery**: People want to get better at something they care about
- They want to develop their skills
- They want to see progress
- They want to tackle increasingly challenging work

**Sarah's approach to mastery:**
- Stretch assignments: Give people work that is slightly beyond their current skill level (not so easy that it is boring, not so hard that it is overwhelming)
- Learning opportunities: "This project will teach you X skill. You have said you want to develop that skill; let's do this."
- Feedback and progress: "Here is what you are doing well. Here is where you can improve. Here is the progress you have made."
- Recognition: "You learned to do X really well. That growth is impressive."

**Example (Expense System):**

A junior developer is working on the mobile-responsiveness feature.

Autonomy: Sarah says: "Make the app work great on mobile. You decide the technical approach. Show me when you are ready."

Mastery: Sarah gives feedback: "Your code is clean. I see you are learning to think about edge cases. That is good progress. What else do you want to learn?"

Increasingly challenging work: In Sprint 6, Sarah assigns the junior developer a more complex feature (API integration) with support from the senior developer.

**3. Purpose**: People want their work to matter
- They want to understand why it matters
- They want to see the impact of their work
- They want to know how their work connects to something larger

**Sarah's approach to purpose:**
- Connect to the mission: "We are building a system that will save employees 5 hours a week on expense reports. That time goes back to meaningful work. That is why we are doing this."
- Show impact: "Users are happy with the mobile feature you built. Here is the feedback."
- Make progress visible: "We shipped 4 features. Employees are using them. That is real impact."
- Link to strategy: "Our transformation is about building a collaborative culture. The new ways of working you are piloting will change how the company operates. This matters."

### 6.5.2 Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic Motivation

Sarah learns the difference between intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, and why it matters.

**Extrinsic Motivation**: Driven by external rewards or punishments
- "I will work hard because I will get a bonus"
- "I will not make mistakes because I do not want to be reprimanded"

**Intrinsic Motivation**: Driven by internal satisfaction
- "I will work hard because the problem is interesting"
- "I will not make mistakes because I want to be proud of my work"

**Research shows that intrinsic motivation is more powerful and sustaining than extrinsic motivation.**

Why?
- Extrinsic motivation works in the short term, but over time, people habituate
- Extrinsic motivation can actually reduce intrinsic motivation: "If I am being paid extra, do I still love the work?" or "If I have to do this to avoid punishment, I resent it"
- Intrinsic motivation lasts: People who find the work meaningful continue to care even when conditions are difficult

**Sarah's approach:**

Instead of relying on bonuses and punishments (which are limited anyway; HR controls those), she builds intrinsic motivation:

- Help people understand why the work matters
- Give them autonomy in how they do the work
- Help them develop mastery
- Build a team where people care about each other
- Celebrate progress and impact

### 6.5.3 Engagement Across Different Work Conditions

Sarah notices that engagement looks different in predictive vs. agile projects.

**In Predictive Projects (Office Renovation):**
- The core team is small and meets less frequently
- Engagement happens through: Clear role, feeling respected, seeing progress toward the deadline
- Challenge: The contractor staff may feel disconnected; they are executing based on specification but may not feel ownership
- Sarah's approach: Celebrate milestones, explain why each phase matters, recognize contributions

**In Agile Projects (Expense System):**
- The team is together every day; they see each other's work constantly
- Engagement happens through: Collaboration, learning, seeing the product develop
- Challenge: The team may get tired after several sprints; momentum can flag
- Sarah's approach: Celebrate each shipped feature, help the team learn from what they built, connect features to user impact, plan how the work evolves

**In Hybrid Projects (Transformation):**
- Some people are on the Design Team (high engagement) and some are on Pilot Teams (medium engagement)
- Steering Committee members are engaged at a strategic level but are not doing the detailed design work
- Sarah's approach: Involve everyone who can contribute; show progress; connect back to purpose; celebrate pilot learnings

### 6.5.4 Burnout and Sustainable Pace

Sarah confronts a hard truth: Sometimes people are disengaged because they are burned out.

**Signs of Burnout:**
- Exhaustion (physical and emotional)
- Cynicism ("This will never work anyway")
- Reduced effectiveness (making mistakes, missing deadlines)
- Withdrawal (going quiet, avoiding collaboration)

**Causes of Burnout:**
- Unsustainable pace: Working too much for too long
- Lack of control: Being told what to do without input
- Lack of recognition: Hard work is not acknowledged
- Unfair treatment: Similar effort gets different rewards
