# 5.1e – Roadmapping and Release Planning

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
- Develop roadmaps appropriate to predictive, agile, and hybrid delivery approaches
- Communicate project timelines to different stakeholder audiences effectively
- Differentiate between detailed schedules, roadmaps, and release plans
- Balance stakeholder needs for visibility with team needs for flexibility
- Update roadmaps as project learning and changes occur

## Why Roadmaps and Release Planning Matter

A roadmap is a high-level visual timeline that communicates the project journey to stakeholders. It shows where you are, where you're going, and what major milestones or deliveries to expect along the way.

Roadmaps serve critical communication functions:
- **Alignment**: Ensure stakeholders share understanding of project direction and timing
- **Visibility**: Provide transparency into what's coming and when
- **Confidence**: Demonstrate that the project has a coherent plan
- **Coordination**: Enable dependent teams or projects to plan around your deliveries
- **Expectations**: Manage stakeholder expectations about delivery timing

The challenge is that different stakeholders need different levels of detail, and different delivery approaches create different types of roadmaps. Executives need high-level milestone visibility. Dependent teams need specific delivery dates. Project teams need flexibility to adapt as they learn.

Effective roadmapping balances these competing needs.

## Roadmaps vs. Schedules vs. Release Plans

These terms are often used interchangeably, but they represent different levels of detail and different purposes.

### Schedule
**Purpose**: Detailed plan of all project work, dependencies, and resource assignments.
**Audience**: Project team and those who need execution-level detail.
**Detail level**: Tasks, durations, dependencies, resource allocations, critical path.
**Typical format**: Gantt chart, network diagram, task list.
**Update frequency**: Frequently (weekly or more often in dynamic projects).

**Example – Office Renovation**: Detailed Gantt chart showing every construction task (demolition, framing, electrical, plumbing, drywall, painting, flooring), durations, dependencies, contractor assignments, critical path through permit approval and major construction milestones.

### Roadmap
**Purpose**: High-level visual timeline showing major milestones, phases, or deliveries.
**Audience**: Executives, sponsors, and stakeholders who need strategic visibility without execution detail.
**Detail level**: Phases, milestones, major deliverables, decision points.
**Typical format**: Timeline graphic, milestone chart, phase diagram.
**Update frequency**: Periodically (monthly or quarterly for strategic updates).

**Example – Office Renovation**: Visual timeline showing major phases (permitting, construction, inspection, move-in) with key milestones (permit approval, substantial completion, final inspection, occupancy).

### Release Plan
**Purpose**: Sequenced delivery of capabilities or features, particularly in agile or software contexts.
**Audience**: Product owners, development teams, and stakeholders receiving incremental deliveries.
**Detail level**: Release dates, feature sets or themes per release, capacity allocation.
**Typical format**: Release calendar, feature roadmap, sprint plan.
**Update frequency**: Regularly (monthly or per release cycle).

**Example – Expense System**: Release plan showing Release 1 (core submission workflow), Release 2 (approvals and integration), Release 3 (reporting and analytics), each with target dates and feature themes.

**The relationships**:
- **Schedule** provides detailed execution plan
- **Roadmap** communicates strategic timeline
- **Release plan** sequences incremental deliveries

All three may exist in a project, serving different purposes for different audiences.

## Roadmapping in Predictive Projects

Predictive roadmaps emphasize comprehensive upfront planning with detailed phase sequences and milestone dates. The expectation is that the roadmap represents a committed plan, with changes managed through formal change control.

### Characteristics of Predictive Roadmaps

**1. Detailed Milestone Sequences**
Major milestones are identified with target dates based on detailed schedule analysis (critical path, resource loading, dependency management).

**2. Phase-Gate Structure**
Roadmaps often show phase boundaries with decision gates (design approval, construction start, acceptance testing, go-live).

**3. Dependency Visibility**
External dependencies and coordination points are highlighted (vendor deliveries, regulatory approvals, dependent projects).

**4. Change-Controlled Updates**
Roadmap changes require formal approval because stakeholders have planned around committed dates.

### Example: Office Renovation Roadmap

**Sarah's office renovation roadmap** (6-month timeline from January to June):

**Phase 1: Planning and Permitting (January - February)**
- Milestone: Design finalized (January 15)
- Milestone: Permit submitted (January 20)
- Gate: Permit approval required before construction start (target February 15)

**Phase 2: Construction (March - May)**
- Milestone: Construction start (March 1)
- Milestone: Rough-in complete (electrical, plumbing, HVAC) (April 1)
- Milestone: Interior finishes start (April 15)
- Milestone: Substantial completion (May 30)
- Gate: Inspection approval required before occupancy (June 1-10)

**Phase 3: Move-In (June)**
- Milestone: Final inspection and occupancy permit (June 10)
- Milestone: IT and furniture installation (June 10-14)
- Milestone: Move-in complete (June 15)
- Gate: Lease expiration (June 30)

**Dependencies Highlighted**:
- Permit approval (city government, external)
- Furniture delivery (vendor, external, long-lead item)
- IT infrastructure project (internal, separate project)

**Communication Strategy**:
- **Executives**: One-page visual timeline showing three phases and key gates
- **Construction team**: Detailed Gantt chart with all tasks and dependencies
- **Dependent teams (IT, HR)**: Specific coordination dates (June 10 IT installation, June 15 move-in)

**Update Frequency**: Monthly roadmap review with sponsor; detailed schedule updated weekly.

### When Predictive Roadmaps Work Well

- Projects with well-defined scope and proven delivery methods
- Stakeholders who need committed dates for coordination
- High cost of schedule changes (contractual commitments, event-driven deadlines)
- Regulatory or compliance environments requiring documented plans

## Roadmapping in Agile Projects

Agile roadmaps emphasize delivery themes and release timing over detailed feature commitments. The expectation is that the roadmap provides directional visibility while preserving flexibility to adapt based on learning and feedback.

### Characteristics of Agile Roadmaps

**1. Release-Based Structure**
Roadmaps show release dates or sprint cadences with feature themes, not exhaustive feature lists.

**2. Outcome Focused**
Emphasize what value or capabilities will be delivered, not detailed specifications.

**3. Flexibility Built In**
Acknowledges that priorities may shift and features may change based on stakeholder feedback and learning.

**4. Now/Next/Later Framework**
Often organizes work as "Now" (current sprint/release), "Next" (upcoming release), and "Later" (future direction), with decreasing specificity.

### Example: Expense System Release Plan

**Sarah's expense system roadmap** (6-month timeline with monthly releases):

**Release 1 (Month 2): Core Submission**
- Employee expense submission (mobile and web)
- Receipt upload
- Basic workflow (submit → manager)
- **Value**: Enable mobile submission, eliminate paper

**Release 2 (Month 3): Approval Workflow**
- Manager approval and delegation
- Multi-level approval routing
- Integration with SAP (posting approved expenses)
- **Value**: Automate approval workflow, eliminate manual finance entry

**Release 3 (Month 4): Reporting and Analytics**
- Expense reporting dashboards
- Approval analytics for managers
- Finance reconciliation tools
- **Value**: Visibility into spending patterns, faster close process

**Pilot (Month 4-5): 50 Users**
- Pilot group uses all features
- Gather feedback for refinements
- **Value**: Validate benefits, identify issues before full rollout

**Full Rollout (Month 6): 500 Users**
- All employees transition
- Stabilization and optimization
- **Value**: Full benefit realization

**Later (Post-Launch): Future Enhancements**
- Travel booking integration
- Corporate card integration
- International tax support
- **Value**: Extended capabilities based on post-launch learning

**Communication Strategy**:
- **Executives**: High-level roadmap showing release dates and value themes
- **Finance stakeholders**: Detailed release features with demo schedule
- **Development team**: Sprint backlog with story-level detail
- **End users**: Release announcements with new capability highlights

**Update Frequency**: Roadmap reviewed monthly; release 3 features may shift based on pilot feedback from release 2.

### When Agile Roadmaps Work Well

- Projects with uncertain requirements requiring iterative discovery
- Stakeholders who can engage frequently and adapt priorities
- Software or digital products where incremental delivery is feasible
- Environments valuing speed and learning over comprehensive upfront planning

## Roadmapping in Hybrid Projects

Hybrid roadmaps combine predictive and agile elements, typically using predictive planning for program-level milestones and compliance gates while using agile planning for delivery-level features and releases.

### Characteristics of Hybrid Roadmaps

**1. Multi-Level Structure**
Program-level roadmap shows fixed milestones; delivery-level roadmap shows flexible releases.

**2. Fixed and Flexible Elements**
Clearly distinguishes what's committed (compliance dates, architecture milestones) from what's adaptive (feature prioritization, workflow details).

**3. Synchronized Cadences**
Program reviews on predictive schedule (quarterly gates); delivery on agile cadence (monthly releases).

**4. Dependency Coordination**
Shows how flexible delivery waves align with fixed program milestones.

### Example: Transformation Program Roadmap

**Sarah's transformation program roadmap** (12-month timeline from February to January):

**Program-Level Milestones (Predictive)**:
- Program kickoff (February)
- Enterprise architecture standards published (April) [FIXED]
- Data migration complete (June) [FIXED]
- Compliance verification complete (December 20) [FIXED]
- Regulatory effective date (January 1) [FIXED - REGULATORY]

**Regional Rollout Waves (Adaptive)**:
- **Wave 1 – Region A** (August): Pilot region, largest customer base
  - Features: Core consent management, basic retention, audit trails
  - Approach: 4 sprints, monthly releases

- **Wave 2 – Region B** (September): Second largest region
  - Features: Core consent + workflow automation (learn from Region A)
  - Approach: 3 sprints (benefit from Region A lessons)

- **Waves 3-5 – Regions C, D, E** (October - November): Remaining regions
  - Features: Core consent + region-specific workflow customization
  - Approach: Parallel 3-sprint implementations

**Delivery-Level Planning (Agile)**:
Each regional wave follows agile delivery:
- Sprint 1: Consent collection and storage
- Sprint 2: Retention rules and audit trails
- Sprint 3: Workflow customization and training
- Sprint 4 (Region A only): Optimization and lessons capture

**Fixed Elements**:
- Data migration architecture (established by June)
- Enterprise API standards (published by April)
- Compliance scope (regulatory requirements, non-negotiable)
- Regional go-live dates (driven by regulatory deadline)

**Flexible Elements**:
- Regional workflow configurations (adapted to regional preferences)
- Feature prioritization within compliance scope (regional teams prioritize based on value)
- Rollout sequence (selected to manage risk, could be adjusted)

**Communication Strategy**:
- **Executive steering committee**: Program-level roadmap with fixed milestones and regional waves
- **Regional stakeholders**: Regional-specific roadmap showing their 3-4 sprint plan with feature themes
- **Delivery teams**: Sprint backlogs with story-level detail
- **Compliance team**: Compliance verification roadmap showing regional review schedule

**Update Frequency**:
- Program milestones: Quarterly review (rarely change without formal approval)
- Regional roadmaps: Monthly update (feature priorities may shift based on learning)
- Sprint plans: Updated every sprint

### When Hybrid Roadmaps Work Well

- Large programs with regulatory or architectural certainty and delivery uncertainty
- Multiple teams with different delivery approaches
- Stakeholders needing program predictability with delivery flexibility
- Projects balancing compliance rigor with customer adaptation

## Tailoring Roadmaps to Stakeholder Needs

Different stakeholders need different roadmap views. Effective roadmapping creates multiple views from the same underlying plan.

### Executive View: Strategic Milestones
**What they need**: Confidence that the project is on track; visibility to major decisions and deliveries; understanding of key risks and dependencies.

**Format**: One-page timeline showing phases, major milestones, decision gates, and current status.

**Example – Transformation Program Executive View**:
Timeline graphic showing:
- Program phases (initiation, architecture, migration, regional rollouts, compliance verification)
- Fixed milestones (architecture April, migration June, regulatory deadline January)
- Status indicators (green/yellow/red)
- Key risks highlighted (e.g., "Region C resource constraint - mitigation in progress")

### Delivery Team View: Detailed Plan
**What they need**: Enough detail to plan and execute work; clarity on dependencies; understanding of priorities.

**Format**: Detailed schedule (Gantt chart, sprint backlog) with tasks, dependencies, assignments.

**Example – Expense System Team View**:
Sprint backlog showing:
- User stories for current sprint with acceptance criteria
- Story point estimates and capacity
- Dependencies on IT infrastructure team
- Definition of done for each story

### Dependent Team View: Coordination Points
**What they need**: Specific dates when they need to deliver or receive deliveries; clarity on what's needed.

**Format**: Dependency schedule showing handoff dates and deliverable descriptions.

**Example – Office Renovation IT Dependency**:
Coordination schedule showing:
- June 1: Access to space available for IT infrastructure installation
- June 10: IT cabling, network equipment, phone systems installation complete
- June 14: IT systems tested and ready for user acceptance
- June 15: Move-in day, IT support staff on-site

### Customer/User View: Delivery Expectations
**What they need**: Understanding of when new capabilities become available; what changes to expect.

**Format**: Release calendar with user-focused capability descriptions.

**Example – Expense System User View**:
Release calendar showing:
- **Release 1 (March)**: Mobile app available, submit expenses from phone
- **Release 2 (April)**: Managers approve in app, faster processing
- **Release 3 (May)**: New reporting dashboard shows your expense history
- **Full Launch (June)**: Everyone switches to new system, old system retired

## Updating Roadmaps: When and How

Roadmaps aren't static. They should be updated as the project learns, circumstances change, or decisions shift priorities.

### When to Update Roadmaps

**1. Significant Schedule Changes**
If major milestones shift due to delays, acceleration, or replanning.

**Example – Office Renovation**: Permit approval delayed from February 15 to March 1 (two-week delay). Construction start shifts, affecting all downstream milestones. Roadmap updated to reflect new dates.

**2. Scope Changes**
If significant scope is added or removed, affecting delivery timing or content.

**Example – Transformation Program**: Regulatory guidance expands retention requirements. Roadmap updated to show expanded scope in regional deliveries.

**3. Priority Shifts**
In agile or hybrid projects, if stakeholder priorities change and release content shifts.

**Example – Expense System**: Pilot feedback indicates reporting features are more valuable than expected. Release 3 (reporting) moved earlier; some Release 2 features deferred to post-launch.

**4. Risk Events**
If a risk materializes and the mitigation plan affects the roadmap.

**Example – Transformation Program**: Regional skills assessment reveals gaps. Training added to regional roadmaps, extending Region C and D timelines by two weeks.

### How to Update Roadmaps

**Process**:
1. **Assess impact**: What changed? How does it affect milestones or deliveries?
2. **Update underlying plan**: Revise detailed schedule or backlog first
3. **Update roadmap views**: Reflect changes in stakeholder-appropriate roadmap views
4. **Communicate changes**: Alert stakeholders whose plans depend on changed dates
5. **Document rationale**: Explain why the roadmap changed

**Governance**:
- **Predictive roadmap changes**: Often require sponsor or change control approval, especially for committed milestone dates
- **Agile roadmap changes**: Feature priorities can shift based on product owner decisions; release dates may require sponsor approval
- **Hybrid roadmap changes**: Fixed elements (program milestones) require approval; flexible elements (feature priorities) managed through product ownership

**Example – Expense System Priority Shift**:

**What changed**: Pilot user feedback indicated reporting dashboard was more valuable than expected; several Release 2 approval features were "nice to have" but not critical.

**Impact assessment**: No schedule impact; affects feature sequencing within releases.

**Update process**:
1. Product owner (finance director) reviewed feedback
2. Proposed moving reporting dashboard to Release 2, deferring some approval workflow features to post-launch
3. Reviewed with sponsor (confirmed no regulatory or control issues)
4. Updated roadmap: Release 2 now includes reporting; some workflow features moved to "Later"
5. Communicated to team (sprint planning adjusted) and users (updated release expectations)

**Governance**: Product owner decision within established authority; no sponsor approval required because release dates and budget unchanged.

## Common Roadmapping Mistakes

**Mistake 1: Too Much Detail for the Audience**
Showing task-level schedules to executives who need milestone visibility, overwhelming them with unnecessary detail.

**Prevention**: Tailor roadmap detail to audience needs. Executives get milestones; teams get task detail.

**Mistake 2: False Precision in Uncertain Environments**
Committing to specific feature delivery dates in agile projects where learning will shift priorities.

**Prevention**: In agile roadmaps, show release dates with feature themes, not locked feature lists. Use "Now/Next/Later" to acknowledge uncertainty.

**Mistake 3: Static Roadmaps**
Creating a roadmap at project start and never updating it, leading to roadmaps that don't reflect reality.

**Prevention**: Review and update roadmaps regularly (monthly or quarterly). Communicate changes to stakeholders.

**Mistake 4: Ignoring Dependencies**
Failing to highlight external dependencies or coordination points, leading to surprise delays when dependencies aren't managed.

**Prevention**: Explicitly show external dependencies on roadmaps. Coordinate with dependency owners on timing.

**Mistake 5: One Roadmap for All Stakeholders**
Using the same roadmap view for executives, delivery teams, and dependent teams, failing to meet anyone's needs well.

**Prevention**: Create multiple roadmap views from the same plan, tailored to stakeholder needs.

## Reflection Questions

1. Does your current project have a roadmap that's appropriate for the delivery approach (predictive, agile, or hybrid)?

2. Are you providing different roadmap views to different stakeholders based on their needs, or are you showing everyone the same level of detail?

3. When was the last time you updated your project roadmap? Does it still reflect reality, or has it become outdated?
