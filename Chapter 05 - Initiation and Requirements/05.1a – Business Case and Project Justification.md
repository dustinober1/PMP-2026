# 5.1a – Business Case and Project Justification

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
- Explain the purpose and components of a project business case
- Differentiate between business cases for predictive, agile, and hybrid projects
- Analyze solution options using financial metrics (ROI, NPV, payback period)
- Determine when a business case needs revisiting during project execution
- Align project justification to organizational strategy and portfolio priorities

## Why Business Cases Matter

Every project consumes resources that could be used elsewhere. The business case answers the fundamental question: Why is this project worth doing? It documents the problem or opportunity, analyzes solution options, quantifies expected benefits, estimates costs and risks, and recommends a course of action.

Without a solid business case, projects survive on organizational momentum rather than demonstrated value. When priorities shift, when budgets tighten, when leadership changes, projects without clear business justification become vulnerable. The business case is the project's insurance policy against cancellation and its compass for decision-making when trade-offs arise.

The business case is typically created before the project is formally authorized, often as part of portfolio planning or capital budgeting processes. The project manager may or may not be involved in creating it, but must understand it thoroughly to make aligned decisions throughout execution.

## Core Components of a Business Case

While formats vary by organization, most business cases include:

### 1. Problem or Opportunity Statement
A clear description of what drives the need for the project. This might be:
- A problem to solve (system failures, regulatory non-compliance, inefficient processes)
- An opportunity to capture (market expansion, competitive advantage, technology enablement)
- A mandate to fulfill (regulatory requirement, strategic directive, merger integration)

**Example – Office Renovation (Predictive)**: Current office space lease expires in 18 months. Building has accessibility compliance issues and lacks modern collaboration spaces. Employee surveys indicate workspace dissatisfaction affecting recruitment and retention.

**Example – Expense System (Agile)**: Current expense processing takes 14 days average, frustrating employees and delaying financial close. Paper-based approvals create audit risk. Finance team spends 40 hours/month on manual data entry and exception handling.

**Example – Transformation Program (Hybrid)**: New data privacy regulations require customer consent management and data retention controls by regulatory deadline. Current systems lack necessary audit trails and consent tracking. Non-compliance penalties could reach $5M annually.

### 2. Strategic Alignment
How the project connects to organizational strategy, goals, and portfolio priorities. This section demonstrates that the project isn't just a good idea, but the right idea given organizational direction.

**Example – Office Renovation**: Aligns to corporate real estate strategy (consolidate locations, modernize workspaces) and talent strategy (attract and retain top talent through workplace experience).

**Example – Expense System**: Supports digital transformation initiative and employee experience improvement goals. Enables finance modernization roadmap.

**Example – Transformation Program**: Critical for regulatory compliance strategy. Enables customer trust initiative and risk management goals. Required for continued market operation.

### 3. Solution Options Analysis
Evaluation of alternative approaches, not just the recommended solution. This demonstrates due diligence and provides decision-makers with context for the recommendation.

Common options to consider:
- Do nothing (accept current state)
- Minimal intervention (address immediate pain, defer comprehensive solution)
- Multiple solution approaches (build vs. buy, different vendors, different scope levels)

**Example – Office Renovation**:
- **Option A (Do Nothing)**: Renew current lease. Cost: $2M/year. Risk: Continued compliance issues, recruitment challenges.
- **Option B (Renovate Current Space)**: Update current building. Cost: $8M capital + $2M/year lease. Risk: Construction disruption, still outdated building.
- **Option C (Relocate to Modern Space)**: Move to new building with turnkey build-out. Cost: $12M capital + $2.5M/year lease. Benefit: Modern amenities, recruitment advantage, compliance resolved.

**Example – Expense System**:
- **Option A (Do Nothing)**: Continue current process. Cost: 480 staff hours/year in finance (~ $50K). Risk: Continued delays and audit exposure.
- **Option B (Enhance Current System)**: Add workflow automation to existing platform. Cost: $80K. Benefit: Reduce processing time to 7 days, cut manual effort by 50%.
- **Option C (Replace with Cloud Solution)**: Implement SaaS expense platform. Cost: $120K implementation + $40K/year subscription. Benefit: Reduce processing to 2 days, mobile access, analytics, eliminate manual entry.

**Example – Transformation Program**:
- **Option A (Minimal Compliance)**: Add consent checkboxes and basic retention rules. Cost: $500K. Risk: Meets letter of law but not spirit; vulnerability to future regulation changes.
- **Option B (Platform Enhancement)**: Extend current CRM with consent management module. Cost: $2M. Benefit: Integrated solution, regulatory compliance, limited process change.
- **Option C (Enterprise Data Platform)**: Implement comprehensive data governance platform. Cost: $8M. Benefit: Future-proof architecture, supports additional regulations, enables data analytics strategy.

### 4. Financial Analysis
Quantification of costs and benefits using standard financial metrics. The depth of analysis varies by project size and organizational standards, but typically includes:

#### Net Present Value (NPV)
The present value of future cash flows minus the initial investment. Positive NPV indicates value creation. Higher NPV is better. Accounts for the time value of money.

**Example – Office Renovation (Option C)**:
- Initial investment: $12M
- Annual lease savings from reduced square footage: $300K
- Annual recruitment cost reduction (estimate): $400K
- 10-year NPV at 8% discount rate: $1.2M
- Interpretation: Project creates value over 10 years despite high initial cost

#### Return on Investment (ROI)
The ratio of net benefits to costs, expressed as a percentage. Shows efficiency of investment. Higher ROI is better. Doesn't account for time value of money.

**Example – Expense System (Option C)**:
- Total cost over 3 years: $240K (implementation + subscriptions)
- Total savings over 3 years: $420K (labor savings + faster close benefits)
- ROI: ($420K - $240K) / $240K = 75%
- Interpretation: Every dollar invested returns $1.75

#### Payback Period
The time required to recover the initial investment. Shorter payback is better. Simple to understand but doesn't account for benefits beyond payback or time value of money.

**Example – Expense System (Option C)**:
- Initial investment: $120K
- Annual savings: $140K
- Payback period: 120K / 140K = 0.86 years (about 10 months)
- Interpretation: Investment recovered in less than a year

#### Benefit-Cost Ratio (BCR)
The ratio of benefits to costs. BCR > 1.0 indicates value creation. Higher BCR is better.

**Example – Transformation Program (Option B)**:
- Total cost over 5 years: $2.5M (implementation + operations)
- Avoided compliance penalties: $15M (estimated)
- Operational efficiency gains: $2M
- BCR: $17M / $2.5M = 6.8
- Interpretation: Every dollar invested returns $6.80 in value

### 5. Risk and Assumptions
Key uncertainties that could affect the business case. This section demonstrates realistic thinking and provides context for sensitivity analysis.

**Example – Office Renovation**:
- **Assumption**: Real estate market remains stable (lease rates don't spike)
- **Assumption**: Recruitment benefits materialize (workspace quality affects talent decisions)
- **Risk**: Construction delays push move-in beyond lease expiration, requiring temporary space
- **Risk**: Hybrid work trends reduce office utilization, undermining space investment

**Example – Expense System**:
- **Assumption**: Finance team adoption is high (user resistance doesn't block efficiency gains)
- **Assumption**: Integration with accounting system works as expected
- **Risk**: SaaS vendor viability (startup with limited track record)
- **Risk**: Actual usage doesn't match pilot results (benefits don't scale)

### 6. Recommendation
Clear statement of which option is recommended and why, with decision criteria explained.

**Example – Transformation Program**: Recommend Option B (Platform Enhancement). Rationale: Meets regulatory requirements with acceptable risk, integrates with existing systems minimizing user disruption, delivers in time for compliance deadline, leaves architecture flexibility for future regulations. Option C provides superior long-term architecture but timeline and cost uncertainty create compliance risk. Option A creates ongoing vulnerability to regulatory interpretation and future requirement changes.

## Business Cases Across Delivery Approaches

The purpose of a business case is consistent across predictive, agile, and hybrid projects, but the level of detail and timing of refinement differs significantly.

### Predictive Business Cases: Detailed and Comprehensive

Predictive business cases aim for comprehensive analysis before project authorization. All options are evaluated in detail. Financial models project multiple years. Risks are enumerated exhaustively. The business case assumes that the solution is largely defined upfront.

This detailed approach works when:
- Solution options are well-understood (proven technology, established vendors)
- Benefits can be quantified reliably (replacement of known costs, compliance with clear requirements)
- Stakeholders expect detailed justification before authorization
- The project is large enough that the cost of business case development is proportionally small

**Sarah's Office Renovation**: The business case included detailed cost estimates from construction firms, multi-year lease comparisons, employee survey data quantifying recruitment impacts, and risk analysis of construction timelines. Because the solution (office space) is well-understood and the investment is large, this detailed analysis was appropriate and expected.

### Agile Business Cases: Lean and Iterative

Agile business cases establish why the problem is worth solving and set investment boundaries, but defer solution details until learning occurs. Options analysis is lighter. Financial models focus on investment limits and expected value themes rather than detailed projections. The business case acknowledges that the solution will emerge through iterations.

This lean approach works when:
- Solution options are uncertain (emerging technology, user needs discovery required)
- Benefits depend on details not yet known (feature set, user adoption patterns)
- Speed to market is critical (delaying for detailed analysis costs opportunity)
- The project is small enough that lightweight justification is proportional

**Sarah's Expense System**: The business case quantified current process costs and inefficiencies, set a budget boundary ($150K) and timeline (six months), and identified expected benefit themes (faster processing, reduced manual work, better employee experience). Specific features and technical approach were left flexible, to be determined through discovery and stakeholder feedback.

The agile business case trusts that iterative learning will steer investment toward value. It replaces comprehensive upfront analysis with frequent validation through working software and stakeholder feedback.

### Hybrid Business Cases: Fixed and Flexible Elements

Hybrid business cases are detailed where requirements are certain and lean where they're uncertain. Compliance requirements, architectural decisions, and integration points receive detailed analysis. Feature prioritization, user experience, and workflow details remain flexible.

This balanced approach works when:
- Some elements are certain (regulatory requirements) while others are uncertain (user adoption, feature value)
- Large programs need portfolio-level justification but delivery-level flexibility
- Different stakeholders have different confidence needs (executives need program-level detail, teams need delivery-level flexibility)

**Sarah's Transformation Program**: The business case detailed compliance requirements, architectural options, and data migration costs with precision. Regional rollout sequence, feature prioritization, and workflow customization were described thematically, with details deferred to regional planning. This gave the portfolio board confidence in program justification while preserving flexibility for regional teams.

## When Business Cases Get Revisited

Business cases aren't write-once documents. They should be revisited when foundational assumptions change or when decisions require value validation.

### Triggers for Business Case Revisiting

**1. Major Assumption Invalidation**
If a core assumption underlying the business case proves false, the justification may no longer hold.

**Example – Expense System**: The business case assumed 500 employees would use the new system. If a merger adds 1,500 employees, the cost-benefit equation changes. The project might need additional investment (more licenses, more configuration), but also delivers greater benefits (savings scale across larger population).

**2. Significant Scope Changes**
If the project scope changes materially, the business case may need updating to reflect new costs and benefits.

**Example – Office Renovation**: The business case assumed 60,000 square feet. If growth projections increase the requirement to 80,000 square feet, costs increase but so do capacity benefits. The business case should be updated to reflect the new scope.

**3. Material Cost or Schedule Variances**
If costs overrun significantly or timelines extend dramatically, the financial analysis may no longer support the investment.

**Example – Transformation Program**: The business case projected $2M implementation cost over 12 months. If the project is tracking toward $3.5M over 18 months, the BCR changes from 6.8 to 3.9. Still positive, but decision-makers should know the updated economics.

**4. Benefit Realization Assessment**
As the project delivers capabilities, actual benefits should be compared to projections. If benefits aren't materializing, the business case should be updated.

**Example – Expense System**: The business case projected 2-day processing time. If actual processing after implementation is 5 days, the labor savings don't materialize as projected. The project team should investigate why (user adoption? technical issues?) and update benefit expectations.

**5. Strategic Alignment Changes**
If organizational strategy shifts, a previously well-aligned project may no longer fit priorities.

**Example – Office Renovation**: If the organization adopts a remote-first strategy, the business case for premium office space weakens. The project might continue with reduced scope or be canceled in favor of distributed workspace investments.

### The Project Manager's Role in Business Case Management

Project managers don't always create business cases, but they're responsible for:
- **Understanding the business case thoroughly**: You can't make aligned decisions if you don't know why the project exists
- **Monitoring assumptions**: Track whether business case assumptions remain valid
- **Flagging material changes**: Alert sponsors when costs, schedules, scope, or benefits diverge significantly from the business case
- **Providing data for benefit realization**: Capture metrics needed to validate that projected benefits are actually delivered

In agile and hybrid projects, the project manager (or product owner) actively refines the business case as learning occurs. In predictive projects, business case updates are typically triggered by change control processes.

## Practical Example: Business Case in Action

Let's follow Sarah's expense system project through business case creation and refinement.

### Initial Business Case (Agile, Lean Format)

**Problem**: Current expense processing takes 14 days average, requires 40 hours/month of manual finance work, and creates audit risk through paper-based approvals. Employee satisfaction with expense process is 2.1/5.

**Strategic Alignment**: Supports digital transformation initiative and employee experience goals.

**Solution Approach**: Implement cloud-based expense management platform with mobile submission, automated workflows, and integration to accounting system. Details of features and configuration to be determined through discovery with stakeholders.

**Investment Boundary**: $150K budget, six-month timeline, five-person cross-functional team.

**Expected Benefits**:
- Reduce processing time to 2 days (based on vendor case studies)
- Eliminate 30 hours/month manual finance work
- Improve employee satisfaction through mobile-first experience
- Reduce audit risk through digital approval trails

**Financial Analysis**:
- Cost: $120K implementation + $40K/year subscription
- Savings: $50K/year labor + $30K/year faster close benefits
- Payback: ~10 months
- 3-year ROI: 75%

**Key Assumptions**: Finance team adopts new platform, integration works as designed, vendor remains viable, usage patterns match pilot results.

**Recommendation**: Proceed with implementation using agile approach. Validate assumptions through early releases and adjust feature priorities based on stakeholder feedback.

### Mid-Project Business Case Update (After 3 Months)

**Progress**: Platform is implemented, pilot group (50 users) has been using it for one month.

**Findings**:
- **Processing time**: Achieved 3 days average (better than current, not yet 2-day target)
- **Finance effort**: Reduced by 15 hours/month (50% of projection, investigation shows workflow approvals still manual)
- **User satisfaction**: 4.1/5 in pilot group (significant improvement)
- **Technical issues**: Integration requires custom mapping, adding $20K cost

**Business Case Impact**:
- Costs increased to $140K (within budget tolerance)
- Benefits partially materializing; workflow automation needed to achieve full labor savings
- Assumption validation: User adoption strong, but workflow configuration more complex than expected

**Recommendation**: Continue project. Prioritize workflow automation features in next sprint. Full benefits achievable with additional configuration effort.

### Post-Implementation Business Case Validation (After 9 Months)

**Results**:
- **Processing time**: 2.5 days average (close to target)
- **Finance effort**: Reduced by 28 hours/month (70% of projection)
- **User satisfaction**: 4.3/5 across full user base
- **Actual costs**: $145K implementation + $40K/year subscription

**Financial Validation**:
- Projected 3-year ROI: 75%
- Actual 3-year ROI: ~60% (slightly lower due to higher costs and partial labor savings)
- Payback period: 12 months (vs. 10 projected)

**Lessons for Future Business Cases**:
- Integration complexity was underestimated; future projects should include technical discovery in estimates
- Labor savings depend on workflow automation, not just system replacement; workflow analysis should be explicit in business cases
- User adoption benefits (satisfaction) exceeded expectations; qualitative benefits deserve more weight in business cases

## Common Business Case Mistakes

**Mistake 1: Optimism Bias**
Overestimating benefits and underestimating costs. Most projects exceed cost estimates and underdeliver benefits relative to business cases.

**Prevention**: Use historical data from similar projects, include risk contingencies, have business cases reviewed by independent parties.

**Mistake 2: Ignoring Qualitative Benefits**
Focusing only on financial metrics while ignoring employee satisfaction, risk reduction, strategic positioning, or customer experience.

**Prevention**: Include qualitative benefits explicitly, even if not financially quantified. Decision-makers value them.

**Mistake 3: Forgetting Ongoing Costs**
Analyzing implementation costs but ignoring operational, licensing, maintenance, or support costs.

**Prevention**: Include total cost of ownership (TCO) analysis covering multiple years of operations.

**Mistake 4: Creating One-Time Business Cases**
Treating business cases as authorization documents rather than living references for decision-making.

**Prevention**: Revisit business cases at project milestones, when assumptions change, and during benefit realization assessment.

**Mistake 5: Mismatching Detail to Uncertainty**
Creating detailed financial projections for uncertain initiatives or lightweight justification for major capital investments.

## Strategy Analysis: Understanding the Business Context

Strategy analysis provides the foundation for creating strong business cases. It helps project managers understand not just what the project should deliver, but why it matters and how it creates value in the broader organizational context.

### Current State Analysis

Before defining solutions, you must understand the current state deeply. Current state analysis reveals the real problems, constraints, and opportunities that drive project need.

#### Key Current State Analysis Techniques

**SWOT Analysis**
- **Strengths**: Current capabilities that can be leveraged
- **Weaknesses**: Current problems or gaps to address
- **Opportunities**: External factors the project can leverage
- **Threats**: External risks the project must address or mitigate

**Sarah's Expense System SWOT:**
- **Strengths**: Finance team experienced, existing processes documented
- **Weaknesses**: Manual processes, poor user experience, audit risks
- **Opportunities**: New mobile technology, cloud platforms available
- **Threats**: Competitor efficiency improvements, regulatory changes

**Value Stream Mapping**
Visualizing end-to-end processes to identify waste, delays, and improvement opportunities.

**Sarah's Current State Value Stream (Expense Processing):**
```
Employee submits (5 min) → Manager approval (2 days) → Finance review (3 days)
→ Data entry (2 hours) → Payment processing (1 day) → Reconciliation (weekly)
Total lead time: 14 days
Value-added time: 7 minutes
Waste: 99.7% of total time
```

**Root Cause Analysis**
Understanding the underlying causes of problems rather than addressing symptoms.

**5 Whys Example:**
Problem: Expense processing takes 14 days
1. Why? → Manual approvals and data entry
2. Why? → Paper-based system
3. Why? → No automated workflow system
4. Why? → Previous attempts at automation failed due to resistance
5. Why? → Poor user experience in proposed solutions

**Current State Assessment Questions:**
- What are the actual processes, not just documented ones?
- What are the real pain points for stakeholders?
- What constraints limit improvement (technology, policy, culture)?
- What risks exist in the current state?
- What capabilities can we leverage?
- Why haven't these problems been solved before?

### Future State Definition

Future state defines what success looks like after the project. It should be ambitious yet achievable, and clearly connected to business objectives.

#### Future State Definition Techniques

**Vision Statement**
A compelling, concise description of the desired future state.

**Example**: "Employees submit expenses in under 2 minutes from anywhere, with automatic approval routing and real-time visibility for managers. Finance team focuses on analysis instead of data entry."

**Target Operating Model**
Defines how the organization will operate after the change, including:
- Processes
- Organization structure
- Technology systems
- Metrics and governance

**Gap Analysis**
Identifies the differences between current and future states:

| Dimension | Current State | Future State | Gap |
|------------|---------------|--------------|-----|
| Processing Time | 14 days | 2 days | 12 days reduction |
| User Satisfaction | 2.1/5 | 4.5/5 | 2.4 point improvement |
| Manual Effort | 40 hours/month | 5 hours/month | 35 hours reduction |
| Audit Risk | High (paper) | Low (digital) | Risk reduction |
| Mobility | None | Full mobile | New capability |

**Success Metrics Definition**
Clear, measurable criteria for success:

**Financial Metrics:**
- ROI, NPV, payback period
- Cost savings
- Revenue increase

**Operational Metrics:**
- Process cycle time
- Error rate reduction
- Resource utilization

**Customer/Stakeholder Metrics:**
- Satisfaction scores
- Adoption rates
- Net Promoter Score

**Risk Metrics:**
- Compliance level
- Audit findings
- Security incidents

### Business Context Analysis

Understanding the broader business context ensures the project aligns with organizational strategy and external environment.

#### Environmental Analysis

**PESTLE Analysis**
Examines external factors that may impact the project:

- **Political**: Regulatory changes, political stability
- **Economic**: Market conditions, economic trends
- **Social**: Cultural shifts, demographic changes
- **Technological**: Emerging technologies, digital trends
- **Legal**: Compliance requirements, legal changes
- **Environmental**: Sustainability, environmental regulations

**Sarah's PESTLE Analysis (Expense System):**
- **Political**: Increasing financial regulation
- **Economic**: Pressure to reduce operational costs
- **Social**: Mobile-first expectations from employees
- **Technological**: Cloud SaaS solutions mature and secure
- **Legal**: Data retention requirements changing
- **Environmental**: Push for paperless operations

**Competitive Analysis**
Understanding how competitors or similar organizations address similar challenges:

- What solutions do they use?
- What performance do they achieve?
- What can we learn from their experience?
- How can we differentiate?

**Industry Benchmarking**
Comparing current performance to industry standards:

| Metric | Current | Industry Average | Best in Class |
|--------|---------|------------------|---------------|
| Expense Processing Time | 14 days | 5 days | 1 day |
| Cost per Transaction | $12 | $5 | $2 |
| User Satisfaction | 2.1/5 | 3.5/5 | 4.7/5 |
| Audit Findings | 3/year | 1/year | 0/year |

### Stakeholder Impact Analysis

Understanding how the change affects different stakeholders helps build support and identify resistance.

**Stakeholder Impact Matrix:**

| Stakeholder | Current State Pain | Future State Benefit | Change Impact |
|-------------|-------------------|---------------------|---------------|
| Employees | 14-day wait, paper receipts | 2-minute mobile submission | High |
| Finance Team | 40 hours manual work | 5 hours oversight | High |
| Managers | Delayed visibility | Real-time approvals | Medium |
| IT Department | Legacy system maintenance | Cloud vendor management | Medium |
| Auditors | Paper trail | Digital audit log | Positive |
| Executives | Delayed financial close | Faster reporting | Positive |

**Change Readiness Assessment:**
Evaluate organization's readiness for change:
- Leadership support
- Cultural readiness
- Capability gaps
- Resource availability
- Risk tolerance

### Risk Analysis in Business Context

Strategy analysis must include risks that could prevent the project from delivering value.

**Business Risk Categories:**

**Market Risks:**
- Changing customer needs
- Competitive responses
- Market acceptance

**Operational Risks:**
- Implementation complexity
- Resource availability
- Process disruption

**Financial Risks:**
- Cost overruns
- Benefits not materializing
- ROI not achieved

**Strategic Risks:**
- Misalignment with strategy
- Strategy changes during project
- Wrong assumptions about future

**Sarah's Risk Analysis (Expense System):**

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| User adoption low | Medium | High | Involve users early, pilot program, training |
| Integration issues | Medium | Medium | Technical discovery, vendor evaluation |
| Benefits not achieved | Low | High | Regular benefit tracking, mid-project adjustments |
| Security concerns | Low | High | Security review, compliance validation |
| Vendor viability | Low | Medium | Established vendor, contract protections |

### Strategy Analysis Process

**Step 1: Understand Current State**
- Document actual processes and performance
- Identify root causes of problems
- Assess current capabilities and constraints

**Step 2: Define Future State**
- Create compelling vision
- Define success metrics
- Identify gaps to close

**Step 3: Analyze Business Context**
- Conduct PESTLE analysis
- Benchmark against industry
- Analyze competitive landscape

**Step 4: Assess Stakeholder Impact**
- Map stakeholder impacts
- Assess change readiness
- Plan engagement strategy

**Step 5: Analyze Risks**
- Identify business risks
- Assess probability and impact
- Plan mitigation strategies

**Step 6: Synthesize Findings**
- Combine all analysis into clear problem statement
- Develop solution options
- Create recommendation

### Integration with Business Case Development

Strategy analysis directly feeds the business case:

- **Problem Statement**: Comes from current state analysis
- **Benefits**: Quantified through gap analysis
- **Risks**: Identified in risk analysis
- **Assumptions**: Validated through context analysis
- **Success Criteria**: Defined in future state

Strong strategy analysis creates business cases that are:
- Grounded in reality
- Aligned with strategy
- Backed by data
- Resilient to risks
- Clear on success criteria

**Prevention**: Match business case detail to project size, uncertainty, and delivery approach. Predictive projects need detail. Agile projects need boundaries and themes.

## Key Takeaways

- Business cases justify why projects are worth doing by documenting problems, analyzing options, and quantifying value
- Financial metrics (NPV, ROI, payback, BCR) provide quantitative comparison of solution options
- Predictive business cases are comprehensive; agile business cases are lean; hybrid business cases balance fixed and flexible elements
- Business cases should be revisited when assumptions change, scope changes, costs vary materially, benefits underdeliver, or strategy shifts
- Project managers must understand business cases to make aligned decisions and flag when business case assumptions are invalidated
- Common mistakes include optimism bias, ignoring qualitative benefits, forgetting ongoing costs, treating business cases as one-time documents, and mismatching detail to uncertainty

## Reflection Questions

1. When was the last time you reviewed your current project's business case? Are the original assumptions still valid?

2. If you were asked to create a business case for an agile project with high uncertainty, how would you balance stakeholder needs for justification with acknowledgment of unknowns?

3. How would you approach a situation where mid-project findings suggest the business case benefits won't materialize as projected?
