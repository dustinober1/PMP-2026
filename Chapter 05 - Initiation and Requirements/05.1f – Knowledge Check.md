# 5.1f – Knowledge Check

## Knowledge Check: Starting the Project

1.  **Business Case:** Your project's business case was approved six months ago, and since then, the organization's strategic priorities have shifted significantly due to a market disruption. The project is currently in the planning phase. What is the BEST course of action?
    *   A) Continue with the original plan, as the business case was already approved.
    *   B) Update the business case to reflect the new strategic priorities and present it to the sponsor.
    *   C) Inform the project team that the business case is no longer relevant.
    *   D) Accelerate the project to deliver quickly before priorities shift again.

2.  **Project Charter:** A project manager is assigned to a critical project but finds that the project charter vaguely defines success criteria and offers no clear authority for resource allocation. What should the project manager do FIRST?
    *   A) Begin planning based on informal discussions with stakeholders.
    *   B) Document the ambiguities and proceed, noting the risks.
    *   C) Work with the sponsor to refine the charter's success criteria and authority.
    *   D) Ask the team to develop the success criteria.

3.  **Delivery Approach:** A project involves developing a new, innovative software product where user requirements are expected to evolve frequently. The organization needs to deliver value incrementally to gain market feedback. Which delivery approach is MOST suitable?
    *   A) Predictive
    *   B) Agile
    *   C) Hybrid
    *   D) Waterfall

4.  **Constraints, Assumptions, Dependencies:** During initiation, you document that "customer integration team will be available to support API integration by Week 8." This is an example of a(n):
    *   A) Constraint
    *   B) Assumption
    *   C) Dependency
    *   D) Risk

5.  **Roadmapping:** An executive stakeholder requests a detailed Gantt chart showing exact dates for all features for a highly innovative project with uncertain requirements. How should the project manager respond?
    *   A) Provide the Gantt chart as requested to maintain executive confidence.
    *   B) Explain that a detailed Gantt chart is not suitable for an innovative project and propose a theme-based roadmap with flexible dates.
    *   C) Agree to provide the Gantt chart but note that dates are subject to frequent change.
    *   D) Escalate the executive's request to the sponsor.

**Answers:**
1.  **B** - The business case is a living document. If foundational assumptions (like strategic alignment) change, it needs to be updated and re-validated with the sponsor.
2.  **C** - The charter is the PM's authorization. Ambiguity here will cause problems throughout the project. The PM must clarify this with the sponsor first.
3.  **B** - Agile approaches are designed for high uncertainty and incremental value delivery with frequent feedback.
4.  **B** - It's something you believe to be true for planning but isn't guaranteed; if it proves false, it becomes a risk. It's also a dependency, but primarily an assumption about that dependency.
5.  **B** - A detailed Gantt chart provides false precision for an innovative project with uncertain requirements. The PM should educate the stakeholder on a more appropriate roadmap type.
