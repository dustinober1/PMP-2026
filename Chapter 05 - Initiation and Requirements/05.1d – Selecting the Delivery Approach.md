# 5.1d – Selecting the Delivery Approach

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:
- Apply decision criteria for selecting predictive, agile, or hybrid delivery approaches
- Assess project characteristics to determine delivery approach fit
- Evaluate organizational readiness for different delivery approaches
- Tailor delivery approaches to project context rather than defaulting to organizational norms
- Recognize when hybrid approaches balance competing needs

## Why Delivery Approach Selection Matters

One of the most consequential decisions in project initiation is choosing how the project will be delivered. Will you use a predictive approach with detailed upfront planning and phase-gated execution? An agile approach with iterative discovery and frequent adaptation? Or a hybrid approach that combines elements of both?

This isn't a philosophical question about which approach is "better." It's a practical question about which approach fits the project's characteristics, the team's capabilities, and the stakeholders' needs. The wrong choice creates friction: teams fighting their process instead of being enabled by it.

Unfortunately, many organizations default to a single delivery approach regardless of project fit. "We're an agile shop" or "We do waterfall here" becomes policy rather than decision. PMI's perspective is clear: delivery approach should be intentionally selected based on project characteristics, not organizational default.

## Decision Criteria for Delivery Approach Selection

Effective delivery approach selection considers multiple factors. No single factor determines the choice; it's the combination that matters.

### 1. Requirement Clarity and Stability

**How well-defined are the requirements? How likely are they to change?**

**Predictive fit**: Requirements are well-understood, stable, and unlikely to change significantly. Stakeholders can specify what they need upfront with confidence.

**Example – Office Renovation**: Office space requirements are clear: square footage, conference rooms, accessibility compliance, security requirements. Building codes are fixed. Requirements won't evolve significantly during construction.

**Agile fit**: Requirements are uncertain, expected to evolve, or require discovery. Stakeholders know the problem but not the detailed solution.

**Example – Expense System**: Users know they want faster processing and mobile access, but specific features, workflows, and UX designs need discovery. Requirements will be refined through stakeholder feedback and iteration.

**Hybrid fit**: Some requirements are certain (regulatory, architectural) while others are uncertain (features, workflows).

**Example – Transformation Program**: Regulatory compliance requirements are fixed and detailed. Regional workflow preferences and feature prioritization need discovery and adaptation.

### 2. Technology Maturity and Familiarity

**Is the technology proven or emerging? Is the team experienced with it?**

**Predictive fit**: Technology is mature, proven, and well-understood. The team has experience with it. Implementation approaches are established.

**Example – Office Renovation**: Construction technology and methods are well-established. The construction firm has built similar spaces many times.

**Agile fit**: Technology is emerging, the team is learning, or technical risks require experimentation. Iterative learning reduces risk.

**Example – Expense System**: The SaaS platform is relatively new. The team hasn't integrated with it before. SAP connector capabilities need validation. Iterative implementation allows technical discovery and course correction.

**Hybrid fit**: Core architecture is proven (predictive) but implementation technologies or integration patterns require learning (agile).

**Example – Transformation Program**: Enterprise API standards are established (predictive), but regional teams are learning API integration techniques (agile at team level).

### 3. Risk Tolerance and Cost of Change

**What is the cost of getting it wrong? How expensive is change?**

**Predictive fit**: The cost of change is high. Getting requirements wrong or needing rework is very expensive. Upfront planning reduces this risk.

**Example – Office Renovation**: Changing office layout after construction starts is extremely expensive (demolition, reconstruction, schedule delays). Detailed planning upfront is cost-effective.

**Agile fit**: The cost of change is low. Software can be refactored. Learning through iteration is more efficient than comprehensive upfront planning.

**Example – Expense System**: Software features can be added, modified, or removed with relatively low cost. Early releases allow course correction before significant investment.

**Hybrid fit**: Some elements have high change costs (architecture, compliance) while others have low change costs (features, workflows).

**Example – Transformation Program**: Data migration architecture changes are expensive (redesign, re-migration). Feature prioritization changes are inexpensive (reprioritize backlog).

### 4. Stakeholder Engagement and Feedback Cadence

**How frequently can stakeholders provide feedback? How comfortable are they with iterative delivery?**

**Predictive fit**: Stakeholders provide input during defined phases (requirements, design review, acceptance testing) but aren't available for frequent feedback.

**Example – Office Renovation**: Construction oversight happens at phase gates (foundation, framing, systems, finishes) but daily stakeholder presence isn't feasible.

**Agile fit**: Stakeholders can engage frequently (sprint reviews, daily feedback) and value early, partial delivery over waiting for complete solution.

**Example – Expense System**: Finance leadership attends bi-weekly sprint demos, provides feedback on working features, and adjusts priorities based on learning.

**Hybrid fit**: Program stakeholders engage at milestone reviews (predictive) while delivery team stakeholders engage iteratively (agile).

**Example – Transformation Program**: Executive steering committee reviews program milestones quarterly. Regional stakeholders participate in monthly release reviews and provide ongoing feedback.

### 5. Scope Flexibility vs. Schedule/Budget Flexibility

**What can vary: scope, schedule, or budget?**

**Predictive fit**: Scope is fixed (contractual, regulatory), but schedule and budget have some flexibility. The goal is to deliver the defined scope within acceptable timeline and cost variance.

**Example – Office Renovation**: Scope is largely fixed (required square footage, compliance requirements). Schedule has limited flexibility (lease expiration). Budget has modest flexibility (contingency reserves).

**Agile fit**: Schedule and budget are fixed (time-box, investment limit), but scope is flexible. The goal is to maximize value delivered within time and budget constraints.

**Example – Expense System**: Six months and $150K are fixed boundaries. Features are prioritized and delivered until time/budget are consumed, with highest-value features first.

**Hybrid fit**: Some scope is fixed (compliance, architecture) while other scope is flexible (features). Some schedule milestones are fixed (regulatory deadlines) while others are flexible (release timing).

**Example – Transformation Program**: Regulatory compliance scope is fixed with a fixed deadline (January 1). Regional feature prioritization and rollout sequence are flexible.

### 6. Team Experience and Organizational Culture

**Does the team have experience with the delivery approach? Does the organizational culture support it?**

**Predictive fit**: Team and organization are comfortable with detailed planning, phase gates, and change control. Culture values predictability and comprehensive documentation.

**Example – Office Renovation**: Construction industry operates predictively. The construction firm has established phase-gate processes. The organization expects detailed Gantt charts and milestone tracking.

**Agile fit**: Team and organization are comfortable with iteration, adaptive planning, and frequent reprioritization. Culture values speed, learning, and customer feedback over comprehensive documentation.

**Example – Expense System**: Small cross-functional team has agile experience. Finance stakeholders are comfortable with iterative delivery and demo-driven validation.

**Hybrid fit**: Large program with multiple teams having different experience levels. Organization needs program-level predictability with team-level flexibility.

**Example – Transformation Program**: Program governance expects predictable milestone tracking. Regional teams have varying agile maturity. Hybrid approach provides program control with team autonomy.

### 7. Regulatory and Compliance Requirements

**Does the project operate in a regulated environment? Are there audit or documentation requirements?**

**Predictive fit**: Heavy regulatory or compliance requirements that demand comprehensive documentation, traceability, and formal approvals.

**Example – Transformation Program (Compliance Elements)**: Data privacy regulation requires documented consent management processes, audit trails, and compliance verification. These elements need predictive rigor.

**Agile fit**: Minimal regulatory constraints; speed and customer value prioritized over documentation.

**Example – Expense System**: Limited regulatory requirements beyond standard financial controls. Agile iteration is feasible.

**Hybrid fit**: Regulatory elements are managed predictively while non-regulated elements are managed adaptively.

**Example – Transformation Program**: Compliance capabilities (consent, retention, audit) are managed predictively with full documentation. Regional workflow customization is managed adaptively.

## The Delivery Approach Selection Framework

Given these criteria, how do you actually make the decision? Consider this framework:

### Step 1: Assess Project Characteristics

Rate each characteristic on a spectrum from "Strongly Predictive" to "Strongly Agile":

| Characteristic | Predictive | Hybrid | Agile |
|----------------|------------|---------|-------|
| Requirements | Well-defined, stable | Mix of fixed and evolving | Uncertain, evolving |
| Technology | Mature, proven | Mix of proven and emerging | Emerging, learning needed |
| Cost of change | High (hard to change) | Mixed (some high, some low) | Low (easy to change) |
| Stakeholder feedback | Phase gates | Program milestones + sprints | Frequent, continuous |
| Scope/time/budget flexibility | Scope fixed | Some fixed, some flexible | Time/budget fixed, scope variable |
| Team experience | Predictive processes | Mixed experience | Agile processes |
| Regulatory needs | Heavy documentation | Compliance + flexibility | Minimal constraints |

### Step 2: Identify the Dominant Pattern

If most characteristics lean predictive: Consider predictive approach.
If most characteristics lean agile: Consider agile approach.
If characteristics are mixed: Consider hybrid approach.

### Step 3: Assess Readiness

Can the team and organization execute the indicated approach?

- **Team capability**: Does the team have skills and experience with the approach?
- **Stakeholder comfort**: Will stakeholders engage as the approach requires?
- **Organizational support**: Does the organization provide necessary tools, training, and governance?

### Step 4: Tailor and Document

No project fits a pure approach perfectly. Tailor the approach to context:
- Predictive project in an agile organization? Add more frequent reviews, shorter phases.
- Agile project in a predictive organization? Provide roadmap visibility, document decisions.
- Hybrid project? Explicitly define what's fixed vs. flexible.

Document the delivery approach in the project charter so stakeholders understand how the project will operate.

## Practical Examples: Delivery Approach Selection

Let's walk through Sarah's three projects and see how delivery approach selection played out.

### Office Renovation: Why Predictive?

**Requirement clarity**: Very high. Square footage, compliance codes, furniture specs are all well-defined.
**Technology maturity**: Very high. Construction methods are proven.
**Cost of change**: Very high. Changing design after construction starts is extremely expensive.
**Stakeholder feedback**: Phase gates (design approval, milestone inspections).
**Flexibility**: Scope is largely fixed; schedule has hard constraint (lease expiration).
**Team experience**: Construction industry operates predictively.
**Regulatory**: Building codes require documented compliance.

**Conclusion**: Strongly predictive project. Detailed planning, phase gates, comprehensive change control.

**Tailoring**: Sarah added more frequent stakeholder walkthroughs than typical construction projects because employee buy-in was critical for the talent strategy goal. This predictive-plus-engagement tailoring addressed organizational culture needs.

### Expense System: Why Agile?

**Requirement clarity**: Low. Users know desired outcomes (faster processing, mobile access) but features need discovery.
**Technology maturity**: Medium. SaaS platform is proven in other companies but new to this team.
**Cost of change**: Low. Software features can be added, modified, removed with modest cost.
**Stakeholder feedback**: Frequent. Finance leadership available for bi-weekly demos.
**Flexibility**: Time (six months) and budget ($150K) are fixed; features are prioritized.
**Team experience**: Cross-functional team has agile experience.
**Regulatory**: Minimal (standard financial controls, no special compliance).

**Conclusion**: Strongly agile project. Sprint-based iteration, frequent demos, adaptive planning.

**Tailoring**: Sarah provided monthly roadmap updates to finance leadership showing upcoming feature themes, addressing their need for visibility while maintaining agile flexibility. This agile-plus-roadmap tailoring addressed stakeholder communication needs.

### Transformation Program: Why Hybrid?

**Requirement clarity**: Mixed. Compliance requirements are detailed and fixed; regional workflows need discovery.
**Technology maturity**: Mixed. Enterprise architecture is proven; regional teams are learning API integration.
**Cost of change**: Mixed. Data migration architecture is expensive to change; feature prioritization is cheap to change.
**Stakeholder feedback**: Mixed. Executive steering committee wants quarterly reviews; regional stakeholders want frequent feedback.
**Flexibility**: Mixed. Regulatory deadline is fixed; regional rollout sequence is flexible.
**Team experience**: Mixed. Program governance team uses predictive processes; regional teams vary in agile maturity.
**Regulatory**: Heavy at program level (compliance, audit); lighter at regional level.

**Conclusion**: Hybrid program. Predictive at program level (milestones, compliance, architecture); agile at delivery level (regional features, workflows).

**Approach Definition**:
- **Predictive elements**: Regulatory compliance scope, data migration milestones, architecture standards, program governance
- **Agile elements**: Regional feature prioritization, workflow customization, sprint-based delivery
- **Integration points**: Quarterly program reviews, monthly cross-regional sync, shared architecture standards

**Tailoring**: Sarah created a program roadmap showing fixed milestones (architecture, data migration, regulatory deadline) with regional delivery waves shown as capacity allocations rather than detailed feature commitments. This gave executives predictability while preserving regional flexibility.

## Common Delivery Approach Selection Mistakes

**Mistake 1: Defaulting to Organizational Norm**
Choosing the delivery approach the organization always uses regardless of project fit.

**Example**: "We're an agile organization, so all projects use sprints" applied to a construction project with high change costs and fixed scope.

**Prevention**: Assess project characteristics explicitly. If organizational norm doesn't fit, justify the tailored approach.

**Mistake 2: Confusing Tools with Approach**
Believing that using specific tools (Jira, MS Project) determines the delivery approach.

**Example**: "We use Jira, so we must be agile" when the project is actually using Jira for predictive phase tracking.

**Prevention**: Focus on how the project manages uncertainty, change, and stakeholder engagement, not which tool is used.

**Mistake 3: All-or-Nothing Thinking**
Believing projects must be purely predictive or purely agile, missing hybrid opportunities.

**Example**: Forcing a program with clear compliance requirements and uncertain features into a fully predictive approach, losing adaptation benefits.

**Prevention**: Consider hybrid approaches when project characteristics are mixed.

**Mistake 4: Ignoring Team Readiness**
Selecting an approach the team isn't capable of executing.

**Example**: Choosing agile for a team with no agile experience and no organizational support for training or coaching.

**Prevention**: Assess team and organizational readiness. If readiness is low, either invest in capability building or choose an approach the team can execute.

**Mistake 5: Stakeholder Expectations Mismatch**
Choosing an approach that doesn't align with stakeholder expectations or availability.

**Example**: Selecting agile for a project where stakeholders expect detailed upfront plans and can't participate in frequent reviews.

**Prevention**: Assess stakeholder engagement capacity and communication preferences as part of approach selection.

## When Hybrid is the Right Answer

Hybrid approaches often get criticized as "trying to please everyone" or "the worst of both worlds." But hybrid is the right answer when project characteristics genuinely differ across elements.

**Hybrid works when**:
- Some requirements are certain (regulatory, architectural) while others are uncertain (features, workflows)
- Different project phases have different characteristics (predictive initiation, agile delivery, predictive closeout)
- Different teams or workstreams have different delivery needs
- Organizational governance needs program-level predictability with team-level flexibility

**Hybrid fails when**:
- Used as a compromise to avoid making hard decisions about approach
- Implemented without clear definition of what's predictive vs. agile
- Teams are confused about which approach applies to their work
- Governance doesn't understand hybrid and treats everything as predictive

**Keys to successful hybrid**:
- **Explicit definition**: Document what elements are predictive, what elements are agile, and why
- **Clear boundaries**: Define integration points where predictive and agile elements connect
- **Aligned governance**: Ensure governance processes match the approach (don't apply phase-gate governance to agile work)
- **Team clarity**: Every team member knows which approach applies to their work

## Documenting the Delivery Approach

The selected delivery approach should be documented in the project charter and communicated clearly to all stakeholders.

**What to document**:
- **Approach**: Predictive, agile, or hybrid
- **Rationale**: Why this approach fits project characteristics
- **Key practices**: What specific methods will be used (sprints, phase gates, etc.)
- **Governance**: How decisions will be made and changes managed
- **Stakeholder engagement**: How and when stakeholders will participate

**Example – Expense System Charter Documentation**:

**Delivery Approach**: Agile (Scrum-based)

**Rationale**: Requirements are uncertain and need discovery. Technology requires learning (new SaaS platform). Stakeholders are available for frequent feedback. Time and budget are fixed; features are flexible.

**Key Practices**:
- Two-week sprints
- Bi-weekly sprint demos with finance leadership
- Monthly releases to pilot user group (months 2-5), full release in month 6
- Daily standups for team coordination
- Sprint retrospectives for continuous improvement

**Governance**:
- Product owner (finance director) prioritizes backlog and accepts deliverables
- Sponsor (CFO) reviews monthly progress; approves major scope or budget changes
- Feature changes managed through backlog reprioritization (no formal change control for in-scope features)

**Stakeholder Engagement**:
- Finance leadership: Bi-weekly sprint demos, backlog prioritization sessions
- End users: Pilot feedback sessions, usability testing
- IT infrastructure: Sprint planning for dependency coordination

## Key Takeaways

- Delivery approach should be intentionally selected based on project characteristics, not organizational default
- Key decision criteria include requirement clarity, technology maturity, cost of change, stakeholder engagement, scope/schedule/budget flexibility, team experience, and regulatory requirements
- Predictive approaches fit well-defined requirements, proven technology, high change costs, and phase-gate stakeholder engagement
- Agile approaches fit uncertain requirements, emerging technology, low change costs, and frequent stakeholder engagement
- Hybrid approaches fit mixed characteristics, balancing fixed elements (compliance, architecture) with flexible elements (features, workflows)
- Common mistakes include defaulting to organizational norms, confusing tools with approach, all-or-nothing thinking, ignoring team readiness, and mismatching stakeholder expectations
- Hybrid approaches work when explicitly defined with clear boundaries between predictive and agile elements
- The selected approach should be documented in the charter with rationale, key practices, governance, and stakeholder engagement patterns

## Reflection Questions

1. Was your current project's delivery approach intentionally selected based on project characteristics, or was it the organizational default?

2. If you could redesign your current project's delivery approach based on actual project characteristics, would you choose differently?

3. For hybrid projects: Are the boundaries between predictive and agile elements clearly defined and communicated, or are team members confused about which approach applies to their work?
