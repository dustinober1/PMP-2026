# Business Task 2: Plan and Manage Project Compliance Practice Exam

**ECO Task:** Plan and manage project compliance
**Difficulty:** Level 4/5 (Analysis/Evaluation)
**Questions:** 50 scenario-based questions
**Time:** 90 minutes recommended

---

## Question 1

**Enabler:** 1 | **Methodology:** Predictive

**Scenario:**
A manufacturing project in Germany must comply with both GDPR and local environmental regulations. The project charter was approved 6 months ago. Last week, a new environmental regulation took effect that requires additional air quality monitoring for industrial facilities. The project manager learns that implementing the required monitoring system will cost €50,000 and delay the project by 3 weeks. The sponsor argues that since the charter predates the regulation, the project should be grandfathered in.

**Question:**
What is the BEST action for the project manager to take?

- **Correct:** Submit a change request to incorporate the new regulation and inform the sponsor that compliance is mandatory regardless of charter timing
- **Distractor 1:** Proceed with the project as planned since the charter was approved before the regulation took effect
- **Distractor 2:** Document the regulation in the risk register and continue without implementation since the charter predates it
- **Distractor 3:** Request a legal opinion on whether the project can be exempted as a pre-existing facility

<details>

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | The "retroactive rule" means new regulations apply immediately to all active projects regardless of when they were initiated. Compliance is non-negotiable—the project cannot be "successful" if it's illegal. |
| **PMI Mindset** | Laws and regulations always trump charters and schedules. The PM doesn't debate whether to comply—the PM implements compliance and manages the impact through change control. |
| **The Trap** | Arguments about "grandfathering" or charter timing seem logical but fail because regulatory compliance is absolute. New laws apply now. |

## Question 2

**Enabler:** 2 | **Methodology:** Agile

**Scenario:**
A Scrum team is developing a health app that processes user fitness data. The Product Owner adds a user story: "As a user, I want to share my workout data with my personal trainer." During sprint planning, a developer notes that this feature may require GDPR consent updates since data would be shared with third parties. The Product Owner argues that users already agreed to data sharing in the terms of service.

**Question:**
What is the BEST action for the Scrum Master to take?

- **Correct:** Facilitate a consultation with legal/compliance to determine if new consent is required for third-party trainer access
- **Distractor 1:** Allow the story to proceed since the Product Owner has confirmed consent exists in the terms of service
- **Distractor 2:** Block the story until the Product Owner provides written confirmation of GDPR compliance
- **Distractor 3:** Add a spike story to research consent requirements after the current sprint

<details>
<summary>Detailed Remediation</summary>

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | Regulatory interpretation is not within a Scrum team's or Product Owner's authority. GDPR compliance requires legal review of whether existing consent covers new data sharing scenarios. |
| **PMI Mindset** | Compliance questions trigger authoritative consultation, not team decisions or Product Owner judgment. Legal/compliance provides interpretation. |
| **The Trap** | Accepting Product Owner assurances seems to respect Agile autonomy, but regulatory compliance exceeds Product Owner authority. |

## Question 3

**Enabler:** 3 | **Methodology:** Predictive

**Scenario:**
A construction project has a charter specifying that any safety incident requiring medical attention must be escalated to the steering committee within 24 hours. A worker falls from a ladder and breaks their leg. The project manager treats this as a "first aid" incident internally since the injury was treated at the site and doesn't formally report it to the steering committee, believing it was minor enough to avoid escalating.

**Question:**
What is the PRIMARY governance failure in this scenario?

- **Correct:** The project manager unilaterally reclassified a safety incident to avoid triggering escalation requirements
- **Distractor 1:** The charter should have specified clearer criteria for what constitutes "medical attention"
- **Distractor 2:** The steering committee should have required more frequent safety reporting
- **Distractor 3:** The safety protocol should have been managed by the safety officer, not the project manager

<details>
<summary>Detailed Remediation</summary>

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | Governance escalation thresholds exist for transparency and oversight. The PM doesn't have authority to reinterpret or reclassify incidents to avoid reporting requirements. Broken bones clearly require medical attention. |
| **PMI Mindset** | The PM follows governance requirements as written, not as they wish them to be. Avoiding escalation by reclassifying incidents undermines governance intent. |
| **The Trap** | Focusing on charter wording misses that broken legs objectively require medical attention—the PM bypassed governance to avoid reporting. |

## Question 4

**Enabler:** 1 | **Methodology:** Hybrid

**Scenario:**
A hybrid project spans three countries: the United States (HIPAA applies), Germany (GDPR applies), and China (PIPL applies). The organization's PMO provides a standard privacy policy template based on GDPR. The project manager notes that the template doesn't address Chinese data residency requirements or US healthcare-specific privacy rules. The project manager considers whether to follow the PMO template or develop a custom approach.

**Question:**
What is the BEST approach for the project manager to take?

- **Correct:** Work with legal/compliance to develop a consolidated privacy approach that satisfies the strictest requirements across all three jurisdictions
- **Distractor 1:** Follow the PMO's GDPR template since it represents the most comprehensive privacy regulation
- **Distractor 2:** Create separate privacy approaches for each jurisdiction and document this as a project-specific tailoring
- **Distractor 3:** Request that the PMO update the standard template to account for multi-jurisdictional projects before proceeding

<details>
<summary>Detailed Remediation</summary>

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | When multiple jurisdictions apply, governance must satisfy the strictest requirements across all. PMO templates provide starting points but may require legal tailoring for specific contexts. |
| **PMI Mindset** | Templates are guidance, not substitutes for compliance judgment. When standard OPAs don't fit, seek authoritative interpretation rather than improvising. |
| **The Trap** | Following the PMO template seems compliant, but GDPR may not be the strictest requirement for all data types—PIPL data residency rules are stricter in some areas. |

## Question 5

**Enabler:** 2 | **Methodology:** Predictive

**Scenario:**
A project charter includes the success criterion: "Achieve ISO 27001 certification by Q3." During planning, the project manager discovers that ISO certification requires a 12-month audit trail of security controls, but the project timeline is only 9 months. The project manager raises this issue to the sponsor, who responds: "Just get as much of the certification process done as possible. We'll figure out the rest later and extend the audit trail somehow."

**Question:**
What is the BEST action for the project manager to take?

- **Correct:** Present the factual impossibility to the steering committee and request that the success criteria be revised to reflect achievable certification milestones
- **Distractor 1:** Proceed with the 9-month plan and document the timeline constraint as an assumption in the project management plan
- **Distractor 2:** Extend the project timeline to 12 months to accommodate certification requirements without seeking approval
- **Distractor 3:** Pursue a different certification that can be achieved within 9 months without informing the steering committee

<details>
<summary>Detailed Remediation</summary>

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | Success criteria must be achievable. When a criterion is factually impossible (ISO certification requires 12 months), continuing sets the project up for failure. The governance body must reassess. |
| **PMI Mindset** | The PM identifies when success criteria are unachievable and escalates for governance decision rather than quietly adjusting or accepting impossible targets. |
| **The Trap** | Trying to "extend the audit trail somehow" is not possible—ISO requires documented evidence over time. The criterion itself must change. |

## Question 6

**Enabler:** 3 | **Methodology:** Agile

**Scenario:**
A product owner for a fitness app wants to sell user workout data to insurance companies. The development team notes that the current privacy policy states user data "will never be sold." The product owner argues that the policy can be updated and users can opt-out. The Scrum Master is concerned about retroactively changing privacy terms and whether this violates GDPR or CCPA requirements.

**Question:**
What is the BEST action for the Scrum Master to take?

- **Correct:** Request legal review of whether retroactive privacy policy changes are permissible under GDPR and CCPA before allowing the feature to proceed
- **Distractor 1:** Support the product owner since opt-out provides user choice and the business needs this revenue
- **Distractor 2:** Block the feature since it violates the current privacy policy regardless of business need
- **Distractor 3:** Add a user story to update the privacy policy before implementing the data sharing feature

<details>
<summary>Detailed Remediation</summary>

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | Retroactive privacy policy changes may be illegal under GDPR and CCPA. The product owner and team don't have authority to determine permissibility—legal does. |
| **PMI Mindset** | Privacy compliance is non-negotiable. The PM/Scrum Master facilitates legal review rather than making regulatory interpretation decisions. |
| **The Trap** | Blocking the feature seems protective of users, but the actual question is legal (is this allowed?), not ethical (should we do this?). |
| **Source Link** | `guide/02-strategic/compliance-governance.md` - Data Privacy principles and GDPR/CCPA requirements |

</details>

## Question 7

**Enabler:** 1 | **Methodology:** Predictive

**Scenario:**
A project manager discovers that a team member is the sibling of a vendor being considered for a major contract. The team member offers to recuse themselves from vendor selection meetings, but the project manager has final authority on vendor selection per the charter. The project manager considers allowing the team member to participate since they've offered to recuse if needed, and their technical expertise is valuable for evaluation.

**Question:**
What is the MOST ETHICAL action for the project manager to take?

- **Correct:** Require the team member to fully recuse themselves from all vendor selection activities and documentation
- **Distractor 1:** Allow participation with full disclosure of the relationship documented in meeting minutes
- **Distractor 2:** Allow the team member to provide technical input but exclude them from final decision-making
- **Distractor 3:** Document the relationship and allow participation since the team member proactively offered to recuse

<details>
<summary>Detailed Remediation</summary>

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | Conflicts of interest must be actively managed, not just disclosed. PMI's ethical value of fairness requires that team members with conflicts recuse themselves from related decisions. |
| **PMI Mindset** | Ethical governance requires preventing the appearance of bias, not just managing actual bias. The PM ensures conflicts are eliminated, not just documented. |
| **The Trap** | Allowing participation with disclosure seems reasonable, but the appearance (and reality) of bias remains. Recusal is the only ethical choice. |

## Question 8

**Enabler:** 2 | **Methodology:** Hybrid

**Scenario:**
A hybrid project's charter includes the success criterion: "Deliver 100 user stories." Near the end of the project, the team has delivered 85 high-complexity stories that provide substantial business value. The product owner argues that complexity varies and that delivered value matters more than story count. The product owner declares success based on value delivered, not the story count metric in the charter.

**Question:**
What is the BEST action for the project manager to take?

- **Correct:** Present both the story count metric and value delivered assessment to the steering committee for success determination
- **Distractor 1:** Declare the project successful since value was delivered even if the story count criterion wasn't achieved
- **Distractor 2:** Require the team to deliver 15 additional simple stories to meet the 100-story criterion
- **Distractor 3:** Update the charter to reflect "value delivered" rather than "story count" as the success criterion

<details>
<summary>Detailed Remediation</summary>

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | When success criteria are poorly defined, the governance body should assess actual outcomes. The PM provides transparent information on both the stated metric and arguably better metrics. |
| **PMI Mindset** | The PM provides transparency to governance bodies rather than making unilateral decisions about whether to enforce or reinterpret poorly-written criteria. |
| **The Trap** | Unilaterally declaring success seems reasonable given value delivery, but bypasses the governance body that approved the original criterion. |

## Question 9

**Enabler:** 3 | **Methodology:** Predictive

**Scenario:**
A project charter authorizes the project manager to approve expenditures "up to $15,000 without additional approval." Over the past 6 months, the project manager has consistently approved purchases at the $14,500 level to avoid triggering additional oversight. A new PMO auditor questions this pattern and suggests it may violate procurement governance principles by exploiting the threshold.

**Question:**
What is the BEST action for the project manager to take?

- **Correct:** Review the intent of the approval threshold and adjust practices to align with governance principles rather than technical compliance
- **Distractor 1:** Continue the current practice since each individual approval is within the $15,000 authority granted
- **Distractor 2:** Request that the PMO clarify the threshold in writing to confirm approval practices
- **Distractor 3:** Bundle purchases into larger amounts to stay under the threshold while meeting project needs

<details>
<summary>Detailed Remediation</summary>

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | Governance thresholds exist for oversight, not to be technically navigated around. Consistently approving at $14,500 when the limit is $15,000 suggests exploiting the threshold. |
| **PMI Mindset** | The PM follows the spirit of governance, not just the letter. Consistent patterns just under thresholds signal avoidance of oversight rather than legitimate decision-making. |
| **The Trap** | Technically staying within authority seems compliant, but the pattern suggests gaming the governance mechanism rather than respecting its oversight purpose. |

## Question 10

**Enabler:** 1 | **Methodology:** Agile

**Scenario:**
A Scrum team is developing a product that processes payments. During a retrospective, the team discovers they've been storing payment card security codes (CVV) in their database, which violates PCI DSS requirements. The product owner was unaware of this requirement and argues that fixing it would delay planned features. The Scrum Master needs to decide how to handle this compliance gap.

**Question:**
What is the FIRST action for the Scrum Master to take?

- **Correct:** Stop work on all other features until the PCI DSS violation is corrected
- **Distractor 1:** Add a user story to address PCI DSS compliance in the next sprint
- **Distractor 2:** Escalate to the steering committee to decide whether to fix the violation or continue with planned features
- **Distractor 3:** Document the violation in the risk register and continue with planned features

<details>
<summary>Detailed Remediation</summary>

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | PCI DSS compliance is non-negotiable for payment processing. Storing CVV codes creates immediate legal liability. This is a stop-work situation, not a prioritization decision. |
| **PMI Mindset** | Safety and compliance violations trigger immediate corrective action regardless of impact to planned work. The PM doesn't trade compliance for feature delivery. |
| **The Trap** | Adding a user story treats this as a normal prioritization decision, but compliance violations can't be "scheduled around"—they're immediate stop-work issues. |
| **Source Link** | `guide/02-strategic/compliance-governance.md` - Compliance Radar and Safety Violation scenarios |

</details>

## Question 11

**Enabler:** 2 | **Methodology:** Predictive

**Scenario:**
A project charter specifies that the project manager "has authority to approve scope changes with schedule impact under 2 weeks." A requested change would delay the schedule by 12 days (under 2 weeks), but the project manager knows this will push the project past a key stakeholder's desired launch date. The stakeholder is pressuring the project manager to reject the change to protect their timeline, even though the change provides significant value.

**Question:**
What is the BEST action for the project manager to take?

- **Correct:** Approve the change since it's within chartered authority, and communicate the schedule impact transparently to all stakeholders including the one with the preferred date
- **Distractor 1:** Reject the change to accommodate the stakeholder's preferred timeline and avoid conflict
- **Distractor 2:** Escalate to the steering committee to decide between the change and the stakeholder's timeline
- **Distractor 3:** Negotiate with the requestor to reduce the change's scope to fit within the stakeholder's timeline

<details>
<summary>Detailed Remediation</summary>

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | The charter grants approval authority for decentralized decision-making. If the change meets the criteria (under 2 weeks), the PM should exercise granted authority rather than escalating or rejecting based on stakeholder preference. |
| **PMI Mindset** | The PM makes decisions within granted authority and communicates transparently. Stakeholder preferences don't override the governance framework established in the charter. |
| **The Trap** | Escalating seems cautious, but undermines the point of granting PM authority. The charter established thresholds for decentralized decision-making. |
| **Source Link** | `guide/02-strategic/compliance-governance.md` - Governance Decision Matrix and PM authority levels |

</details>

## Question 12

**Enabler:** 3 | **Methodology:** Hybrid

**Scenario:**
A hybrid project has a charter specifying a monthly steering committee review. During a particularly complex phase involving multiple regulatory approvals, the project manager considers whether to request additional reviews. The project manager worries that frequent reviews might suggest the project is in trouble, but also wants to ensure appropriate governance visibility given the complexity.

**Question:**
What is the BEST action for the project manager to take?

- **Correct:** Request additional steering committee reviews with a clear rationale about complexity and need for guidance decisions
- **Distractor 1:** Maintain the monthly review schedule to avoid appearing to need micromanagement
- **Distractor 2:** Increase informal updates to the sponsor instead of formal steering committee reviews
- **Distractor 3:** Ask the PMO whether additional reviews are appropriate for this project phase

<details>
<summary>Detailed Remediation</summary>

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | Governance cadence should adapt to project needs. Complex phases may benefit from additional oversight. Requesting reviews with clear rationale demonstrates good judgment, not weakness. |
| **PMI Mindset** | The PM proactively ensures appropriate governance visibility rather than hiding behind formal schedules or informal channels. |
| **The Trap** | Worrying about appearance suggests insecurity. Good governance is about transparency, not maintaining perceptions. |

## Question 13

**Enabler:** 1 | **Methodology:** Predictive

**Scenario:**
A project manager is leading a pharmaceutical clinical trial project. The charter requires FDA compliance at all stages. During execution, a team member suggests a faster testing approach that would accelerate the timeline but doesn't fully align with FDA guidelines for clinical trials. The scientific lead supports the approach as "scientifically valid" even if not following FDA's prescribed methodology.

**Question:**
What is the BEST action for the project manager to take?

- **Correct:** Reject the approach until FDA compliance is verified through appropriate regulatory channels
- **Distractor 1:** Allow a small pilot to test the faster approach while seeking FDA guidance
- **Distractor 2:** Escalate to the steering committee to decide between speed and regulatory compliance
- **Distractor 3:** Document the team member's suggestion in the risk register and continue with the FDA-approved approach

<details>
<summary>Detailed Remediation</summary>

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | Regulatory compliance in high-stakes domains (pharmaceuticals) is non-negotiable. The PM doesn't have authority to approve deviations from regulatory requirements regardless of scientific opinion. |
| **PMI Mindset** | Safety and compliance are absolute. The PM stops work when compliance is in question rather than allowing "pilot tests" of regulatory gray areas. |
| **The Trap** | Allowing a pilot seems pragmatic, but pharmaceutical regulations don't allow "testing the boundaries"—compliance is binary. |

## Question 14

**Enabler:** 2 | **Methodology:** Agile

**Scenario:**
A product owner wants to implement a feature that would automatically enroll users in a paid subscription after a free trial, with pre-checked opt-out boxes. The development team notes that this may violate "dark pattern" regulations in several jurisdictions that prohibit default enrollment. The product owner argues that this is standard industry practice and necessary for revenue.

**Question:**
What is the BEST action for the Scrum Master to take?

- **Correct:** Request legal review of whether the proposed feature complies with dark pattern regulations in all target jurisdictions
- **Distractor 1:** Support the feature since the product owner is accountable for product decisions and revenue
- **Distractor 2:** Block the feature since dark patterns are generally considered unethical regardless of legality
- **Distractor 3:** Implement the feature but provide clear opt-out instructions to users

<details>
<summary>Detailed Remediation</summary>

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | Dark pattern regulations are legal compliance issues, not just ethical concerns. The product owner and team don't have authority to determine compliance—legal does. |
| **PMI Mindset** | Compliance decisions are made by legal/compliance, not product owners or Scrum teams. The PM/Scrum Master facilitates authoritative input. |
| **The Trap** | Blocking based on ethics seems principled, but the actual issue is legal compliance—this requires legal interpretation, not ethical judgment by the team. |

## Question 15

**Enabler:** 3 | **Methodology:** Predictive

**Scenario:**
A project manager receives a change request that requires a $25,000 budget increase. The charter specifies that changes under $50,000 can be approved by the project manager. However, this change would also push the project completion date by 3 weeks, missing a contractual deadline with $10,000 per week in penalties. The project manager is unsure if they have authority to approve a change with contractual implications.

**Question:**
What is the BEST course of action for the project manager to take?

- **Correct:** Escalate to the steering committee since the change impacts a contractual milestone with penalties
- **Distractor 1:** Approve the change since the budget impact is within the $50,000 authority threshold
- **Distractor 2:** Reject the change because it misses the contractual deadline
- **Distractor 3:** Request that the change submitter modify the request to avoid schedule impact

<details>
<summary>Detailed Remediation</summary>

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | PM authority in the charter typically references budget thresholds, but contractual obligations represent external governance that exceeds PM approval authority. Missing contractual deadlines triggers penalties and legal implications. |
| **PMI Mindset** | The PM manages within the project's governance envelope. External commitments (contracts) create governance obligations requiring escalation. |
| **The Trap** | Focusing only on the budget threshold ($25,000 is under $50,000) misses that schedule impact triggers contractual consequences beyond PM authority. |

## Question 16

**Enabler:** 1 | **Methodology:** Hybrid

**Scenario:**
A project manager is preparing a project charter and needs to define success criteria. The sponsor suggests vague criteria like "ensure compliance with all applicable regulations" and "maintain high ethical standards." The project manager is concerned these won't be measurable or auditable.

**Question:**
What is the BEST action for the project manager to take?

- **Correct:** Push back on the vague criteria and work with the sponsor to define specific, measurable compliance metrics (e.g., "zero regulatory violations," "100% training completion")
- **Distractor 1:** Accept the sponsor's criteria since the sponsor has authority over the charter and can interpret them during execution
- **Distractor 2:** Document the vague criteria in the charter and add specific metrics in the project management plan
- **Distractor 3:** Ask the compliance department to provide standard success criteria for this type of project

<details>
<summary>Detailed Remediation</summary>

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | Success criteria in the charter must be measurable to enable governance assessment. Vague criteria undermine governance and prevent objective assessment of project success. |
| **PMI Mindset** | The PM ensures project artifacts are fit for purpose. Unmeasurable success criteria create governance failure—success can't be objectively assessed. |
| **The Trap** | Accepting vague criteria seems respectful of sponsor authority, but creates governance failure—compliance can't be objectively verified. |

## Question 17

**Enabler:** 2 | **Methodology:** Predictive

**Scenario:**
A project charter includes the success criterion: "Reduce carbon emissions by 25% compared to baseline." At project closure, the project manager reports 26% reduction and declares success. However, an external audit reveals that the baseline measurement was calculated incorrectly, and actual reduction was only 18%. The project manager argues that the charter defined the baseline, so the project succeeded by that definition.

**Question:**
What is the PRIMARY governance issue in this scenario?

- **Correct:** The charter should have specified how the baseline would be measured, verified, and audited
- **Distractor 1:** The external auditor should have been involved at charter development to validate the baseline methodology
- **Distractor 2:** The steering committee should have required third-party verification of the baseline measurement
- **Distractor 3:** The PMO should have provided a standard template for environmental metrics with validated calculation methods

<details>
<summary>Detailed Remediation</summary>

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | Success criteria must include measurement methodology. "Reduce by 25%" is meaningless without defining how the baseline and reduction are calculated and verified. |
| **PMI Mindset** | SMART criteria require defining not just what success looks like, but how it will be measured and verified. Ambiguous measurement enables gaming or misinterpretation. |
| **The Trap** | Focusing on auditors or third parties misses that the charter itself should have defined measurement methodology to prevent ambiguity. |

## Question 18

**Enabler:** 3 | **Methodology:** Agile

**Scenario:**
A Scrum team discovers that a third-party library they've been using has a critical security vulnerability. The product owner wants to wait until the next sprint to address it because fixing it would delay the current sprint's commitment. The Scrum Master is concerned about the security risk of waiting 2 weeks with a known critical vulnerability in production.

**Question:**
What is the BEST action for the Scrum Master to take?

- **Correct:** Stop using the vulnerable library immediately, even if it means reducing the sprint commitment to address security
- **Distractor 1:** Continue using the library for this sprint and plan to fix it in the next sprint
- **Distractor 2:** Escalate to the product owner's manager to get approval for an immediate fix
- **Distractor 3:** Add the security fix as a high-priority item in the next sprint backlog

<details>
<summary>Detailed Remediation</summary>

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | Critical security vulnerabilities are stop-work issues regardless of sprint commitments. Known vulnerabilities create immediate liability. The team stops using the vulnerable component now. |
| **PMI Mindset** | Security and safety are non-negotiable. Sprint commitments don't override the obligation to address critical security issues immediately. |
| **The Trap** | Planning to fix in the next sprint treats this as normal prioritization, but critical vulnerabilities are immediate risks, not scheduled work items. |

## Question 19

**Enabler:** 1 | **Methodology:** Predictive

**Scenario:**
A project manager receives an email from a vendor offering a "consulting fee" if the project manager selects their product. The email notes that "this is standard industry practice" and that the fee would be paid personally, not to the company. The project manager is tempted by the extra income and considers that this might just be a standard commission.

**Question:**
What is the MOST ETHICAL action for the project manager to take?

- **Correct:** Decline the offer and report the vendor's solicitation to the procurement department
- **Distractor 1:** Decline the offer but do not report the vendor to maintain a good business relationship
- **Distractor 2:** Accept the offer since it's personal income, not a company payment
- **Distractor 3:** Disclose the offer to the sponsor and ask for guidance on whether to accept

<details>
<summary>Detailed Remediation</summary>

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | Kickbacks and bribery are absolute ethical violations regardless of whether paid to company or individual. PMI's ethical values require declining and reporting such solicitations. |
| **PMI Mindset** | Ethical violations aren't situational. A bribe is a bribe regardless of how it's structured or whether "everyone does it." |
| **The Trap** | Disclosing to the sponsor seems transparent, but the correct action is decline and report—the vendor is attempting to corrupt the selection process. |

## Question 20

**Enabler:** 2 | **Methodology:** Hybrid

**Scenario:**
A hybrid project uses a directive PMO that requires all projects to use its standardized status report template. The project manager finds that the template doesn't capture Agile metrics like velocity and cycle time that are relevant to the development work. The project manager considers submitting two reports—the PMO template plus an Agile supplement.

**Question:**
What is the BEST action for the project manager to take?

- **Correct:** Work with the PMO to incorporate Agile metrics into the standard template for hybrid projects
- **Distractor 1:** Submit both the required PMO template and the Agile supplement report
- **Distractor 2:** Use only the PMO template since directive PMO requirements are mandatory
- **Distractor 3:** Ask the steering committee to exempt this project from the PMO template requirement

<details>
<summary>Detailed Remediation</summary>

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | Directive PMOs have authority over reporting standards, but the PM can suggest improvements to templates that don't fit current methodologies. Working with the PMO serves both governance compliance and project needs. |
| **PMI Mindset** | The PM follows mandatory standards while also serving as a feedback mechanism for process improvement. Submitting unsupplemented reports or creating shadow processes bypasses governance. |

## Question 21

**Enabler:** 3 | **Methodology:** Predictive

**Scenario:**
A project manager learns of a new environmental regulation that will affect the project's waste disposal practices. The regulation takes effect in 2 months, but the current project phase won't generate waste for 4 months. The project manager considers waiting to address the regulation until it becomes applicable to avoid "wasting time" on requirements that aren't immediately needed.

**Question:**
What is the BEST action for the project manager to take?

- **Correct:** Update the project management plan now to incorporate the new requirements before they take effect
- **Distractor 1:** Document the regulation in the risk register and address it when waste disposal begins in 4 months
- **Distractor 2:** Continue with current practices since the regulation doesn't apply to current project work
- **Distractor 3:** Request clarification from the environmental agency on how the regulation applies to the project timeline

| **Core Logic** | Proactive compliance planning is more efficient than reactive correction. Updating the plan now ensures compliance when the time comes and prevents rework. |
| **PMI Mindset** | The PM proactively manages compliance requirements rather than waiting until they become urgent. Good governance is anticipatory, not reactive. |
| **The Trap** | Waiting until the regulation applies seems efficient, but may require rework if current planning doesn't account for the new requirements. |

## Question 22

**Enabler:** 1 | **Methodology:** Agile

**Scenario:**
A product owner for a financial application wants to use customer transaction data to train a machine learning model for fraud detection. The development team raises concerns about whether this use is covered by customer consent agreements. The product owner argues that since the data is internal and fraud detection benefits customers, explicit consent isn't needed. The Scrum Master is unsure who has authority to interpret consent requirements.

**Question:**
What is the BEST action for the Scrum Master to take?

- **Correct:** Pause the feature and request guidance from legal/compliance on whether existing consent covers ML training use
- **Distractor 1:** Allow the product owner to proceed since they are accountable for product decisions and customer benefit
- **Distractor 2:** Conduct a team vote on whether the feature complies with data privacy requirements
- **Distractor 3:** Document the team's concerns in the sprint backlog and proceed with development

<details>
<summary>Detailed Remediation</summary>

| Aspect | Details |

| **Core Logic** | Regulatory interpretation is not within a Scrum team's or product owner's authority. When compliance questions arise, pause and seek authoritative guidance from legal/compliance. |
| **PMI Mindset** | Compliance requirements are non-negotiable constraints on Agile delivery. The team has autonomy on HOW to build, but not on WHETHER to comply with regulations. |
| **The Trap** | Allowing the product owner to decide seems to respect Agile autonomy, but regulatory compliance is a strategic guardrail that exceeds product owner authority. |

## Question 23

**Enabler:** 2 | **Methodology:** Predictive

**Scenario:**
A project manager is reviewing the change control log and notices that 15 change requests have been approved in the past month, each within the project manager's approval authority of $10,000. Collectively, these changes represent a $120,000 budget impact that was never presented to the Change Control Board or steering committee. The project manager's authority was intended for minor adjustments, not cumulative scope changes.

**Question:**
What is the BEST action for the project manager to take?

- **Correct:** Immediately notify the steering committee and CCB of the cumulative impact and request formal approval
- **Distractor 1:** Continue approving changes within authority since each individual request was within the $10,000 limit
- **Distractor 2:** Stop approving any further changes and request a charter revision to clarify approval authority
- **Distractor 3:** Update the risk register to note the budget overrun and continue with remaining changes

<details>
<summary>Detailed Remediation</summary>

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | Approval authority exists for decentralized decision-making, but cumulative impacts that fundamentally change the project baseline require governance review. The "death by a thousand cuts" pattern undermines governance. |
| **PMI Mindset** | Governance is about intent as well as rules. The PM exercises judgment when individual actions, while technically compliant, collectively violate governance intent. |
| **The Trap** | Continuing within individual authority limits seems technically correct, but ignores that governance bodies deserve visibility into cumulative impacts. |

## Question 24

**Enabler:** 3 | **Methodology:** Hybrid

**Scenario:**
A hybrid project has an escalation threshold: any issue that impacts the project schedule by more than 2 weeks must be escalated to the sponsor. A critical vendor delays delivery by 10 days. The project manager calculates that through fast-tracking, the team can recover 5 days, leaving a net impact of 5 days—within the threshold. However, fast-tracking requires adding overtime which exceeds the budget's contingency reserve.

**Question:**
What is the MOST APPROPRIATE action for the project manager to take?

- **Correct:** Escalate to the sponsor since the recovery method requires exceeding contingency reserves
- **Distractor 1:** Implement the fast-tracking plan without escalation since the net schedule impact is within threshold
- **Distractor 2:** Request additional budget from the PMO to cover the overtime costs
- **Distractor 3:** Accept the 10-day delay and escalate since it exceeds the 2-week threshold

<details>
<summary>Detailed Remediation</summary>

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | Escalation thresholds should be interpreted broadly. When the recovery method impacts other baselines (budget contingency), the governance intent is triggered. Escalation provides visibility into trade-offs. |
| **PMI Mindset** | Governance thresholds are tripwires for stakeholder visibility, not rules to be technically navigated around. The PM provides transparency when significant trade-offs are required. |
| **The Trap** | Triggering the technical interpretation (net 5 days is under 2 weeks) avoids escalation but hides the budget impact from governance oversight. |

## Question 25

**Enabler:** 1 | **Methodology:** Predictive

**Scenario:**
A project manager discovers that the organization's gift policy prohibits accepting items over $50 in value. A vendor sends the project manager a $200 gift basket as a "thank you" for smooth project execution. The project manager's peers suggest keeping the gift since "everyone does it" and the vendor won't know if it's returned, or sharing it with the team so no individual receives the full value.

**Question:**
What is the MOST ETHICAL action for the project manager to take?

- **Correct:** Return the gift to the vendor with a polite explanation of the gift policy
- **Distractor 1:** Accept the gift but disclose it in the project's next status report
- **Distractor 2:** Share the gift with the entire project team so no individual receives the full value
- **Distractor 3:** Donate the gift to a charity and claim the tax deduction

<details>
<summary>Detailed Remediation</summary>

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | PMI's ethical value of honesty requires following organizational policies on gifts. Accepting prohibited gifts violates ethics regardless of disclosure, sharing, or donation. The correct action is return. |
| **PMI Mindset** | Ethical decisions aren't situational. A violation is a violation regardless of whether "everyone does it" or whether the vendor finds out. |
| **The Trap** | Disclosing or sharing seems like a reasonable middle ground, but the policy prohibits acceptance, not just acceptance without disclosure. |

## Question 26

**Enabler:** 2 | **Methodology:** Agile

**Scenario:**
A Scrum team's velocity has dropped 40% over three sprints. The product owner demands that the Scrum Master "fix the team's performance" and threatens to replace team members. The Scrum Master's analysis reveals that the drop is caused by the product owner adding spike stories to research a complex technical requirement, but these spikes are being counted in velocity calculations without delivering value.

**Question:**
What is the BEST action for the Scrum Master to take?

- **Correct:** Coach the product owner on the difference between delivery velocity and research spikes, and adjust metrics accordingly
- **Distractor 1:** Accept the product owner's demand and pressure the team to increase velocity
- **Distractor 2:** Remove the spike stories from velocity calculations without telling the product owner
- **Distractor 3:** Escalate to the steering committee that the product owner is misusing agile metrics

<details>
<summary>Detailed Remediation</summary>

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | Velocity is a governance metric for forecasting delivery capacity. Spikes (research) don't deliver customer value and shouldn't be counted in velocity. The Scrum Master coaches stakeholders on proper metrics. |
| **PMI Mindset** | Governance metrics should measure what they intend to measure. When metrics are misused, the solution is education, not manipulation or escalation. |
| **The Trap** | Quietly removing spikes from velocity seems helpful, but hides the issue from the product owner who needs to understand the distinction. |

## Question 27

**Enabler:** 3 | **Methodology:** Predictive

**Scenario:**
During a project status review, the PMO director questions why a project has exceeded its schedule variance threshold of ±10% for three consecutive weeks. The project manager explains that the sponsor verbally approved continuing without corrective action because "the team is making good progress." The PMO director states that verbal approvals don't count and the project should have been escalated per the charter.

**Question:**
What is the BEST action for the project manager to take going forward?

- **Correct:** Follow the documented escalation path in the charter when thresholds are exceeded, regardless of verbal sponsor assurances
- **Distractor 1:** Request that the PMO update its policy to allow sponsor discretion in threshold enforcement
- **Distractor 2:** Document the sponsor's verbal approval and continue monitoring without escalation
- **Distractor 3:** Ask the sponsor to send written confirmation of the verbal approval to satisfy the PMO

<details>
<summary>Detailed Remediation</summary>

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | Governance escalation paths and thresholds exist for transparency and early intervention. Verbal approvals bypass governance mechanisms designed to protect the organization. The charter's procedures should be followed. |
| **PMI Mindset** | Governance requires documented trails and accountability. Verbal approvals create audit gaps and risk. The PM follows established governance processes. |
| **The Trap** | Seeking written confirmation seems reasonable, but the issue is that escalation thresholds were exceeded—governance requires visibility, not just documentation. |

## Question 28

**Enabler:** 1 | **Methodology:** Hybrid

**Scenario:**
A project manager learns that a functional manager is pressuring a team member to work on a non-project task during project hours. The charter explicitly authorizes the project manager to "assign and reassign team members within the project" but doesn't specifically address protecting team time from functional requests. The functional manager argues that the charter gives the PM authority over the project, not the team member's time.

**Question:**
What is the BEST action for the project manager to take?

- **Correct:** Work with the functional manager and sponsor to clarify resource allocation governance in the charter
- **Distractor 1:** Redirect the team member to ignore the functional manager's request based on charter authority
- **Distractor 2:** Report the functional manager to the PMO for violating project governance
- **Distractor 3:** Allow the team member to split time and adjust the project schedule accordingly

<details>
<summary>Detailed Remediation</summary>

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | Charter authority ambiguity is a governance gap. Rather than interpreting unilaterally or escalating punitively, the PM works collaboratively to clarify governance. Resource conflicts require clear rules. |
| **PMI Mindset** | Governance gaps are opportunities to improve clarity, not win power struggles. The PM collaborates to resolve ambiguity rather than asserting questionable authority. |
| **The Trap** | Asserting charter authority seems bold, but the charter's actual language is ambiguous about protecting time from functional requests. |

## Question 29

**Enabler:** 2 | **Methodology:** Predictive

**Scenario:**
A project charter includes the success criterion: "Achieve customer satisfaction score of 4.5/5.0." The project delivers a high-quality product, but the customer satisfaction survey is administered during a service outage unrelated to the project, resulting in a score of 3.8/5.0. The project manager argues that the score doesn't reflect project quality and should be adjusted or the criterion waived.

**Question:**
What is the BEST action for the governance body to take?

- **Correct:** Acknowledge the external factor and consider whether the success criterion remains appropriate under the circumstances
- **Distractor 1:** Adjust the satisfaction score to 4.5/5.0 to reflect the actual project quality delivered
- **Distractor 2:** Declare the project a failure since the criterion wasn't met
- **Distractor 3:** Require a new customer satisfaction survey to be administered

<details>
<summary>Detailed Remediation</summary>

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | Success criteria should be measurable and meaningful, but governance bodies must consider context when evaluating results. External factors beyond project control may warrant reassessment. |
| **PMI Mindset** | Governance is about evaluating value delivery, not rigid adherence to metrics that may be skewed by uncontrollable factors. The governance body exercises judgment. |
| **The Trap** | Automatically declaring failure seems objective, but ignores that the metric was skewed by an external factor unrelated to project performance. |

## Question 30

**Enabler:** 3 | **Methodology:** Agile

**Scenario:**
A product owner wants to use customer photos in marketing materials. The development team notes that the terms of service don't explicitly grant this right. The product owner argues that since customers uploaded the photos publicly, implicit consent exists. The Scrum Master is concerned about privacy compliance and whether the terms allow marketing use.

**Question:**
What is the BEST action for the Scrum Master to take?

- **Correct:** Request legal review of whether the terms of service permit the proposed marketing use
- **Distractor 1:** Support the product owner since standard terms usually permit marketing use of public content
- **Distractor 2:** Ask the product owner to obtain explicit consent from customers before using their photos
- **Distractor 3:** Add a user story to update the terms of service for future uploads

## Question 31

**Enabler:** 1 | **Methodology:** Predictive

**Scenario:**
A project manager is assigned to lead a cross-functional initiative involving three departments. Each department has its own PMO with different templates and approval processes. The marketing PMO requires a 15-page charter, while IT requires a 3-page agile charter. The project manager needs to decide which governance framework to follow for this cross-departmental project.

**Question:**
What is the BEST approach for the project manager to take?

- **Correct:** Consult the organizational PMO to determine which template or hybrid approach is appropriate for this cross-functional initiative
- **Distractor 1:** Use the marketing department's charter since they are the primary customer for the project
- **Distractor 2:** Create two separate charters, one for each department's PMO requirements

## Question 32

**Enabler:** 2 | **Methodology:** Hybrid

**Scenario:**
A project manager discovers that the organization's procurement policy (OPA) requires competitive bidding for all contracts over $50,000. The project needs a specialized consultant that only one vendor can provide, with an estimated cost of $75,000. Going through a competitive bid process would delay the project by 6 weeks. The sponsor suggests splitting the contract into two $37,500 contracts to avoid the bidding requirement.

**Question:**
What is the MOST ETHICAL action for the project manager to take?

- **Correct:** Document the sole-source justification and seek a formal waiver from the procurement governance body
- **Distractor 1:** Follow the sponsor's suggestion to split the contract to maintain the project schedule
- **Distractor 2:** Proceed with the single vendor and document the urgency as justification after the fact

## Question 33

**Enabler:** 3 | **Methodology:** Predictive

**Scenario:**
A project charter authorizes the project manager to "approve expenditures up to $15,000 without additional approval." A change request comes in with an estimated cost of $9,500, but the project manager suspects the estimate is artificially low to avoid triggering additional review. The project manager believes the actual cost will likely be $12,000.

**Question:**
What is the BEST action for the project manager to take?

- **Correct:** Reject the estimate as insufficient and require a more detailed cost analysis before approval
- **Distractor 1:** Approve the change since the submitted estimate is under the $15,000 threshold
- **Distractor 2:** Escalate to the CCB given the suspicion that the true cost exceeds the threshold
- **Distractor 3:** Approve with a note that additional funding will be required if costs exceed $15,000

## Question 34

**Enabler:** 1 | **Methodology:** Agile

**Scenario:**
A Scrum team is working on a project that must comply with SOC 2 Type II certification. During sprint planning, the security officer demands that all user stories include detailed security acceptance criteria. The product owner argues this slows down the team and that security can be "tested in" later. The Scrum Master is caught between the security requirement and velocity concerns.

**Question:**
What is the BEST action for the Scrum Master to take?

- **Correct:** Support the security officer's requirement since SOC 2 compliance is a non-negotiable constraint on how work is done
- **Distractor 1:** Facilitate a compromise where security is tested in every other sprint
- **Distractor 2:** Ask the security officer to attend sprint reviews rather than planning

A project manager is managing a global project. In Country A, "facilitation payments" (small payments to expedite routine government actions) are legal and customary. In Country B, these payments are considered bribery. The project manager needs to expedite a permit in Country A and is being asked for a $100 facilitation payment. The organization's code of conduct prohibits all facilitation payments globally.

**Question:**
What is the MOST ETHICAL action for the project manager to take?

- **Correct:** Follow the organization's code of conduct and refuse the facilitation payment
- **Distractor 1:** Make the payment since it's legal and customary in Country A, and document it as a local business expense
- **Distractor 2:** Request guidance from the sponsor on whether to make the payment given the local context

The product owner argues that competitors have this feature and it's critical for market competitiveness, so the team should figure out how to make it compliant.

**Question:**
What is the BEST action for the Scrum Master to take?

- **Correct:** Facilitate a discussion with the product owner and compliance/legal to determine if the feature can be implemented compliantly
- **Distractor 1:** Allow the team to implement the feature since the product owner has prioritized it and the business need is clear
- **Distractor 2:** Remove the story from the backlog until the product owner provides compliance documentation

A project manager receives a whistleblower complaint that a team member is falsifying safety inspection reports to avoid delays. The team member admits to falsifying the reports but claims the safety issues were minor and "didn't matter." The project manager considers whether to report this to HR or handle it internally to protect the team member's career.

**Question:**
What is the MOST ETHICAL action for the project manager to take?

- **Correct:** Report the falsification to HR, the safety officer, and the sponsor, and ensure the safety inspections are properly re-conducted
- **Distractor 1:** Handle it internally by requiring the team member to re-conduct the inspections correctly and document the coaching
- **Distractor 2:** Report to the safety officer only, to keep the issue within the safety function and protect the team member

**Scenario:**
A hybrid project has a controlling PMO that requires all projects to use its risk register template.

The project manager considers maintaining two risk registers—the PMO template for reporting and an Agile register for internal use.

**Question:**
What is the BEST action for the project manager to take?

- **Correct:** Use the PMO template but add Agile-specific risk categories in the "notes" or "custom fields" sections
- **Distractor 1:** Maintain two separate risk registers to satisfy both PMO and Agile needs
- **Distractor 2:** Use only the PMO template since controlling PMO requirements are mandatory

**Scenario:**
A project charter specifies that the project manager "has authority to approve changes costing under $10,000." A change request comes in with an estimated cost of $9,500, but the project manager suspects the estimate is artificially low to avoid the $10,000 threshold. The actual cost will likely be $12,000, which would require escalation.

**Question:**
What is the BEST action for the project manager to take?

- **Correct:** Reject the estimate as insufficient and require a more detailed cost analysis before approval
- **Distractor 1:** Approve the change since the submitted estimate is under the $10,000 threshold
- **Distractor 2:** Escalate to the CCB given the suspicion that the true cost exceeds the threshold
- **Distractor 3:** Approve with a note that additional funding will be required if costs exceed $10,000

<summary>Detailed Remediation</summary>

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | Approval authority is based on informed decision-making. If the estimate appears artificially low to bypass thresholds, the PM requires better information rather than approving questionable estimates or escalating prematurely. |
| **PMI Mindset** | The PM exercises judgment within authority, not blind adherence to submitted numbers. Governance requires quality information, not just formal compliance. |
| **The Trap** | Escalating seems cautious, but the PM can first require better information. Not every suspicion requires escalation. |

## Question 42

**Enabler:** 3 | **Methodology:** Agile

**Scenario:**
A Scrum team is working on a product that must comply with GDPR's "right to be forgotten." During sprint planning, the product owner adds a user story for user profile deletion. A developer notes that while they can delete the profile from the primary database, the data has already been copied to a data warehouse for analytics, and there's no automated deletion process there. The product owner argues that manual deletion from the data warehouse is sufficient.

**Question:**
What is the BEST action for the Scrum Master to take?

- **Correct:** Facilitate a discussion with legal/compliance on whether manual deletion from the data warehouse satisfies GDPR's "right to be forgotten" requirement
- **Distractor 1:** Allow the story to proceed since the product owner has determined that manual deletion is acceptable
- **Distractor 2:** Block the story until an automated deletion process is implemented for the data warehouse
- **Distractor 3:** Add a technical debt story to build automated deletion and proceed with manual deletion in the meantime

<details>
<summary>Detailed Remediation</summary>

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | GDPR compliance requires legal interpretation of whether "right to be forgotten" is satisfied by manual processes or requires automation. The product owner doesn't have authority to make this determination. |
| **PMI Mindset** | Regulatory compliance requires authoritative interpretation. The Scrum Master facilitates legal review rather than allowing product owner or team judgment on regulatory questions. |
| **The Trap** | Blocking the story seems privacy-conscious, but the actual question is legal (does manual deletion satisfy GDPR?), not technical. |

## Question 43

**Enabler:** 1 | **Methodology:** Predictive

**Scenario:**
A government agency project requires compliance with new accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA). The project charter was approved before these standards became law. The agency's PMO has not yet updated its templates to reference the new requirements. The project manager needs to determine how to proceed given the charter doesn't mention the new standard.

**Question:**
What is the BEST action for the project manager to take?

- **Correct:** Update the project's quality management plan to incorporate WCAG 2.1 AA requirements and inform the PMO of the template gap
- **Distractor 1:** Proceed with the old accessibility standards since the charter predated the new law
- **Distractor 2:** Submit a change request to update the charter to reflect the new compliance requirements
- **Distractor 3:** Wait for the PMO to update its templates before incorporating the new requirements

<details>
<summary>Detailed Remediation</summary>

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | New laws apply immediately to all active projects regardless of when they were initiated. The charter sets overall guardrails, but the execution plan must adapt to new legal requirements. |
| **PMI Mindset** | Regulatory compliance is immediate and non-negotiable. The PM doesn't wait for governance artifacts to catch up—they implement requirements and help improve organizational assets. |
| **The Trap** | Waiting for the PMO to update templates seems procedural, but delays necessary compliance work. The project must comply now. |

## Question 44

**Enabler:** 2 | **Methodology:** Hybrid

**Scenario:**
A hybrid project's success criteria include "Achieve net promoter score of 50+ within 90 days of launch." At launch, the product is excellent, but the operations team fails to implement the customer feedback collection system specified in the project plan. Ninety days later, no NPS data exists, so success cannot be measured. The steering committee asks the project manager why this wasn't escalated.

**Question:**
What is the PRIMARY governance failure in this scenario?

- **Correct:** The success criteria should have assigned ownership of post-launch metrics to a specific role
- **Distractor 1:** The project manager should have escalated the operations team's failure to implement the collection system
- **Distractor 2:** The steering committee should have required more frequent status reports on NPS collection
- **Distractor 3:** The PMO should have provided better oversight of the transition to operations

<details>
<summary>Detailed Remediation</summary>

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | Success criteria that extend beyond project execution require assigned ownership for achievement and measurement. Without specifying who is responsible, the criteria is unenforceable. |
| **PMI Mindset** | Governance requires accountability assignment. Success criteria without ownership is wishful thinking, not a measurable target. |
| **The Trap** | Focusing on escalation misses that no one was actually assigned responsibility for the NPS system—it fell through governance design gaps. |

## Question 45

**Enabler:** 3 | **Methodology:** Predictive

**Scenario:**
A project is chartered to "implement a new ERP system." Eighteen months into a 24-month project, a competing ERP vendor releases a significantly better product at lower cost. The project manager considers whether to recommend switching vendors mid-project, which would require writing off 18 months of investment but might deliver better long-term value.

**Question:**
What is the BEST action for the project manager to take?

- **Correct:** Present a business case analysis to the steering committee comparing continued execution vs. switching vendors
- **Distractor 1:** Continue with the current vendor since the charter authorized this approach
- **Distractor 2:** Immediately switch vendors to deliver better value for the organization
- **Distractor 3:** Request a vendor comparison from the procurement department

<details>
<summary>Detailed Remediation</summary>

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | Major strategic decisions like switching vendors mid-project are governance decisions, not PM decisions. The PM provides analysis and recommendations, but the steering committee decides. |
| **PMI Mindset** | The PM manages execution within the strategic direction set by governance. When external changes make the current direction questionable, the governance body reassesses strategy. |
| **The Trap** | Continuing with the current vendor seems loyal to the charter, but charters don't obligate organizations to pursue bad strategies when better options emerge. |

## Question 46

**Enabler:** 1 | **Methodology:** Agile

**Scenario:**
A product owner wants to implement a feature that collects user location data for personalized recommendations. The development team notes that GDPR requires explicit consent for location data collection. The product owner argues that since users can opt out later in settings, implicit consent during onboarding is sufficient. The Scrum Master needs to ensure proper GDPR compliance.

**Question:**
What is the BEST action for the Scrum Master to take?

- **Correct:** Request legal guidance on whether the proposed consent flow satisfies GDPR's explicit consent requirement for location data
- **Distractor 1:** Support the product owner's approach since opt-out provides user control and many apps use this pattern
- **Distractor 2:** Block the feature until explicit opt-in consent is implemented during onboarding
- **Distractor 3:** Add a user story to implement explicit opt-in consent and proceed with the product owner's approach in the meantime

<details>
<summary>Detailed Remediation</summary>

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | GDPR requires explicit consent for certain data types (location is often considered sensitive). The product owner and team don't have authority to interpret whether opt-out satisfies this requirement. |
| **PMI Mindset** | Regulatory interpretation is not within team or product owner authority. The Scrum Master facilitates legal review rather than making compliance decisions. |
| **The Trap** | Blocking seems privacy-conscious, but the actual question is legal (does opt-out satisfy GDPR for location data?), not ethical. |

## Question 47

**Enabler:** 2 | **Methodology:** Predictive

**Scenario:**
A project charter includes the success criterion: "Zero safety incidents throughout the project." During execution, a subcontractor has a near-miss accident that violated safety protocols but resulted in no injuries. The project manager stops work on that activity until root cause analysis is complete. The subcontractor argues that since no one was hurt, this doesn't count as a "safety incident" per the charter.

**Question:**
What is the BEST response from the project manager?

- **Correct:** Maintain the work stoppage until root cause analysis and corrective actions are verified, as near-misses are safety incidents
- **Distractor 1:** Allow work to resume with increased oversight since no one was injured and the charter only counts actual incidents
- **Distractor 2:** Document the near-miss in the risk register and continue with additional safety briefings
- **Distractor 3:** Escalate to the sponsor to decide whether a near-miss counts as a safety incident under the charter

<details>
<summary>Detailed Remediation</summary>

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | Safety is non-negotiable and supersedes all other objectives. Near-misses are safety incidents that require immediate corrective action regardless of whether injury occurred. They're warnings that require systemic correction. |
| **PMI Mindset** | Safety and legal compliance always win. The PM doesn't trade safety for schedule or debate whether near-misses "count"—they're treated as incidents. |
| **The Trap** | "Increased oversight" seems like a reasonable middle ground, but fails to address root cause. Near-misses are treated seriously, not minimized. |

## Question 48

**Enabler:** 3 | **Methodology:** Hybrid

**Scenario:**
A hybrid project's charter specifies a $1M budget with 10% contingency. At 80% complete, the project has spent $920K including $80K of contingency. The remaining work requires an additional $150K, which would exceed both the original budget and the contingency. The project manager considers re-baselining the budget to the new reality without steering committee approval since the project is almost done.

**Question:**
What is the BEST action for the project manager to take?

- **Correct:** Present the situation to the steering committee with options for re-baselining or scope reduction
- **Distractor 1:** Use the remaining contingency to cover as much of the overrun as possible and document the variance
- **Distractor 2:** Re-baseline the budget without steering committee approval since the project is 80% complete
- **Distractor 3:** Request additional funds from the PMO as a simple budget transfer

<details>
<summary>Detailed Remediation</summary>

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | Exceeding the total budget (including contingency) is a baseline change that requires governance approval. Re-baselining is a steering committee decision, not a PM action. |
| **PMI Mindset** | The PM manages within the authorized budget envelope. When that envelope is exceeded, the governance body that authorized the budget must decide. |
| **The Trap** | Re-baselining unilaterally seems practical for a project that's 80% complete, but exceeds the PM's authority and bypasses governance oversight. |

## Question 49

**Enabler:** 1 | **Methodology:** Predictive

**Scenario:**
A project manager is leading a project that will process user data to train AI models. The project manager learns that the engineering team has been using a public AI tool (like ChatGPT) to help debug code, and in doing so, has pasted snippets of production data that may contain user information. The team member didn't realize this was a privacy violation.

**Question:**
What is the BEST action for the project manager to take?

- **Correct:** Immediately stop the data sharing, notify IT/security of the potential data breach, and educate the team on data privacy requirements
- **Distractor 1:** Document the incident as a lesson learned and remind the team not to share production data
- **Distractor 2:** Report the team member to HR for violating data privacy policies
- **Distractor 3:** Ask the team to use a different AI tool that doesn't store data

<details>
<summary>Detailed Remediation</summary>

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | Sharing production data with public AI tools is a data breach requiring immediate containment and security notification. The PM stops the practice, manages the breach response, and educates to prevent recurrence. |
| **PMI Mindset** | Data breaches require immediate response, not just documentation or coaching. The PM ensures breach protocols are followed while also educating the team. |
| **The Trap** | Documenting as a lesson learned seems appropriate, but fails to treat this as the data breach it is—security must be notified immediately. |

## Question 50

**Enabler:** 2 | **Methodology:** Agile

**Scenario:**
A Scrum team is developing a product that uses AI to screen job candidates. During sprint review, the team demonstrates that the AI is 95% accurate at predicting good hires. However, a stakeholder asks whether the AI has been tested for demographic bias. The product owner admits that bias testing hasn't been conducted yet, and the team wants to focus on accuracy first.

**Question:**
What is the BEST action for the Scrum Master to take?

- **Correct:** Prioritize bias testing as a compliance requirement before the AI is used for actual hiring decisions
- **Distractor 1:** Allow the team to continue focusing on accuracy since bias testing can be added later
- **Distractor 2:** Escalate to the steering committee to decide whether accuracy or bias testing should be prioritized
- **Distractor 3:** Add bias testing to the product backlog as a lower priority item

<details>
<summary>Detailed Remediation</summary>

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | AI bias testing is a compliance requirement for hiring tools in many jurisdictions and an ethical imperative. Using an untested AI for hiring decisions creates legal liability and ethical risk. |
| **PMI Mindset** | Compliance and ethics are non-negotiable. The Scrum Master ensures the team doesn't deploy AI tools without proper bias testing, regardless of accuracy metrics. |
| **The Trap** | Treating bias testing as a lower priority backlog item misses that it's a compliance requirement, not an optional feature. |

## Key Takeaways: Compliance Pro-Tips

### 1. The Retroactive Rule
**New laws apply immediately—regardless of charter timing.** If a regulation passes mid-project, you MUST adopt it even if it wrecks your baseline. A project cannot be "successful" if it's illegal. Don't argue "grandfathering"—compliance is non-negotiable.

### 2. Laws > Standards > Policies > Guidelines
**Compliance hierarchy is absolute.** When conflicts occur, laws and safety always win. Never trade compliance for schedule, cost, or scope. OPA (organizational policies) are internal guidance—EEF (external laws/regulations) are mandatory constraints.

### 3. Stop-Work Isn't Optional
**Safety violations, compliance gaps, and critical security vulnerabilities trigger immediate work stoppage.** These aren't risk register items—they're stop-work issues. The PM stops work NOW, documents later, and never "schedules" compliance fixes for future sprints.

### 4. Vague Criteria = Governance Failure
"Ensure compliance" and "maintain high ethical standards" aren't criteria—they're wishful thinking. Push for specific, measurable metrics: "zero regulatory violations," "100% team training completion," "pass ISO 27001 audit." Success must be objectively verifiable.

### 5. Regulatory Interpretation ≠ Your Authority
**When compliance questions arise, PAUSE and seek authoritative guidance.** Product Owners don't interpret GDPR. Teams don't decide HIPAA compliance. Legal/Compliance provides interpretation—PM implements. Don't guess on regulatory questions.

### 6. Governance Bodies Have Purposes
- **Steering Committee:** Continue/pivot/stop decisions, major funding, strategic direction
- **CCB:** Baseline protection, scope/schedule/cost changes
- **PMO:** Standards, templates, methodology guidance (directive vs. supportive)
- **Legal/Compliance:** Regulatory interpretation, not business decisions
- **Escalate when uncertain—transparency is strength, not weakness.**

### 7. Ethics Are Absolute, Not Situational
- **Conflicts of Interest:** Require recusal, not just disclosure
- **Gifts/Bribes:** Return prohibited gifts, report solicitation—no exceptions
- **Facilitation Payments:** Prohibited by PMI ethics regardless of local custom
- **Whistleblower Complaints:** Protect and investigate—never handle safety/ethics violations "internally" to protect careers

### 8. Data Privacy in the AI Era (2026 Exam Focus)
- **Consent is king:** GDPR requires explicit consent for sensitive data (location, health)
- **Right to be Forgotten:** Must delete from ALL systems, not just primary database
- **Training Data:** Users may not have consented to AI use—verify consent scope
- **Public AI Tools:** Pasting production data into ChatGPT is a DATA BREACH—stop immediately and notify security
- **Bias Testing:** Required before deploying AI for hiring/lending—compliance issue, not optional feature

### 9. The Spirit of Governance > The Letter
Consistently approving at $14,500 when the limit is $15,000 suggests exploiting the threshold. Splitting contracts to avoid procurement thresholds violates ethics. Governance mechanisms exist for oversight—respect the intent, don't technically navigate around the rules.

### 10. Multi-Jurisdictional Compliance
When a project spans countries (US/Germany/China), you must satisfy the **strictest requirements across all jurisdictions**. PMO templates provide a starting point but may require legal tailoring. GDPR ≠ strictest for all data types—PIPL (China) has stricter data residency rules in some areas.
