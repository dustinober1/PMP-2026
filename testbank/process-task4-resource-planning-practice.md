### Question 49

**Enabler:** Manage and optimize resource needs and availability | **Methodology:** Agile

**Scenario:**
During a retrospective, the team identifies that their velocity is being limited by the time it takes to set up the automated test environment for each new feature. This setup is currently done manually by one person.

**Question:**
How should the project manager (Scrum Master) encourage the team to optimize this resource bottleneck?

- **Correct:** Suggest the team allocate time in the next sprint to automate the environment setup, treating it as an investment in future velocity.
- **Distractor 1:** Ask the person currently doing the manual setup to work faster or put in overtime.
- **Distractor 2:** Hire a dedicated "Environment Setup Specialist" to handle this task for all future sprints.
- **Distractor 3:** Accept the manual setup as a necessary constraint of the project and adjust the velocity expectations downward.

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | Agile teams should prioritize removing process bottlenecks and technical debt to improve overall resource efficiency and long-term velocity. |
| **PMI Mindset** | Focus on continuous improvement and the removal of impediments to optimize value delivery. |
| **The Trap** | Manual work is a source of waste; hiring a specialist adds a new dependency rather than building team capability. |

### Key Takeaways: Resource Planning & Management

1.  **Accountability is Singular**: While many people can be responsible for doing the work, only one person should be accountable (A) in a RACI matrix to ensure clear decision-making and ownership.
2.  **Availability is a Hard Constraint**: Global and virtual teams must rely on **Resource Calendars** to manage time zone differences, regional holidays, and varied labor laws.
3.  **Optimize Flow, Not Just Busy-ness**: In Agile, use **WIP limits** and **Swarming** to optimize resource throughput rather than focusing on 100% individual utilization.
4.  **T-Shaped Professionals**: Long-term resource optimization in complex projects depends on cross-training and building **"T-shaped" skills** to reduce single-point-of-failure risks.
5.  **Proactive Procurement**: Physical resources with long lead times must be integrated into the schedule and procurement plan during early planning to avoid critical path delays.
6.  **Servant Leadership in Resource Conflict**: When resources are overallocated, the project manager's role is to facilitate negotiation, remove impediments, and advocate for a **sustainable pace**.
