### Question 1
**Enabler:** 6 | **Methodology:** Predictive

**Scenario:**
A project team that has worked together for six months is consistently meeting its milestones, but the Project Manager notices that members have become hesitant to challenge each other's technical assumptions. During a recent design review, a major architectural flaw was overlooked because the junior members did not want to "disrupt the flow" or offend the senior leads. The project is currently in a steady state of execution with high trust levels among the senior staff.

**Question:**
What is the MOST appropriate leadership style for the Project Manager to adopt to address this situation?

- **Correct:** Shift toward a Supporting style (S3) to facilitate healthy conflict and psychological safety.
- **Distractor 1:** Maintain a Delegating style (S4) since the team is high-performing and meeting all schedule baselines.
- **Distractor 2:** Revert to a Directing style (S1) to mandate stricter review protocols and ensure technical accuracy.
- **Distractor 3:** Adopt a Coaching style (S2) to provide more technical guidance to the junior members of the team.

<details>
<summary>Detailed Remediation</summary>

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | The team is in the Norming or Performing stage but is suffering from "Groupthink" or a lack of psychological safety. The Supporting style (S3) is used when the team has high skills but needs facilitation in shared decision-making. |
| **PMI Mindset** | Facilitating dialogue is better than taking over (Directing) or ignoring the safety issue (Delegating). |
| **The Trap** | Staying in Delegating is tempting because the team is hitting milestones, but this ignores the underlying risk of technical debt. |

### Question 2
**Enabler:** 2 | **Methodology:** Agile

**Scenario:**
During a sprint retrospective, several developers express frustration that the Product Owner is frequently changing the acceptance criteria of stories that are already "In Progress." This behavior is causing rework and preventing the team from reaching their predicted velocity. The team feels their autonomy is being undermined and is beginning to wait for explicit instructions before starting any new tasks.

**Question:**
What is the FIRST action the Project Manager (Scrum Master) should take to empower the team?

- **Correct:** Facilitate a meeting between the team and the Product Owner to reinforce the Definition of Ready and the rules of the sprint.
- **Distractor 1:** Escalate the Product Owner's behavior to the Project Sponsor to protect the team from further interruptions.
- **Distractor 2:** Advise the team to ignore the mid-sprint changes and only deliver what was agreed upon during planning.
- **Distractor 3:** Extend the sprint duration to accommodate the additional rework without impacting the team's velocity metrics.

<details>
<summary>Detailed Remediation</summary>

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | Empowerment requires protecting the team's autonomy within the sprint boundaries. Clarifying the "Definition of Ready" and sprint rules is the first step. |
| **PMI Mindset** | Agile PMs act as servant leaders who protect the team from external interference. Solving the problem at the source is preferred. |
| **The Trap** | Escalation is often a distractor. The PM should first try to resolve the conflict by reinforcing established working agreements. |

### Question 3
**Enabler:** 1 | **Methodology:** Hybrid

**Scenario:**
A project involves a predictive hardware engineering team and an agile software development team. During the first integration milestone, the hardware team discovers that the software team's API does not meet the technical specifications defined in the initial project charter. The software team argues that they adapted the API based on user feedback during their third sprint, which was not communicated to the hardware group.

**Question:**
What action should the Project Manager take to establish better expectations at the team level?

- **Correct:** Facilitate a session to create a unified Team Charter that defines cross-team communication protocols and integration synchronization points.
- **Distractor 1:** Update the Project Management Plan to mandate that the software team follows the hardware team's predictive schedule.
- **Distractor 2:** Request that the Product Owner prioritize the hardware team's technical specifications over user feedback in the backlog.
- **Distractor 3:** Assign a dedicated liaison from each team to manage all technical communication and approve any changes.

<details>
<summary>Detailed Remediation</summary>

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | Hybrid projects require a "Bridge-Oriented" execution. Team charters and working agreements are essential to align purpose and set communication norms. |
| **PMI Mindset** | When methodologies clash, the solution is to establish shared governance and communication norms, not to force one methodology onto the other. |
| **The Trap** | Mandating a predictive schedule for an agile team violates the core principles of hybrid management. |
| **Source Link** | `guide/03-team-leadership/building-teams.md` |

</details>

### Question 4
**Enabler:** 3 | **Methodology:** Predictive

**Scenario:**
An experienced team member responsible for a critical path task has suddenly become disengaged, missing several internal deadlines and failing to respond to messages from other team members. The Project Manager has confirmed that the individual's hygiene factors (pay, benefits, and safety) are all met. The individual previously expressed a desire to learn new cloud architecture skills but has been assigned to legacy system maintenance for the last four months.

**Question:**
Based on Motivational Theory, what is the BEST way for the Project Manager to solve this performance problem?

- **Correct:** Provide a stretch assignment involving cloud architecture to address the individual's need for growth and mastery.
- **Distractor 1:** Implement a formal Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) with clear milestones to ensure the critical path is maintained.
- **Distractor 2:** Offer a one-time performance bonus to incentivize the completion of the legacy maintenance tasks.
- **Distractor 3:** Meet with the functional manager to request a replacement for the resource to avoid project delays.

<details>
<summary>Detailed Remediation</summary>

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | According to Herzberg's theory and Pink's Drive (Mastery), once hygiene factors are met, the PM must focus on motivators like growth and responsibility. |
| **PMI Mindset** | Diagnosing the environment and applying intrinsic motivators is the preferred path. Throwing money at a motivation problem is a trap. |
| **The Trap** | PIPs are usually the wrong first answer unless informal coaching and support have already failed. |

### Question 5
**Enabler:** 5 | **Methodology:** Agile

**Scenario:**
A cross-functional agile team consists of members from four different countries and three different time zones. During the first three sprints, the Project Manager observes that the members from the headquarters location dominate the daily standups, while the remote members rarely contribute and often have their cameras turned off. The remote members have recently begun to miss their story commitments.

**Question:**
How should the Project Manager support the team's varied experiences and perspectives?

- **Correct:** Establish core overlap hours and use a "Remote-First" communication strategy where all key discussions are recorded or in writing.
- **Distractor 1:** Mandate that all team members must have their cameras on during all ceremonies to ensure engagement and visibility.
- **Distractor 2:** Schedule all team meetings during the headquarters' business hours to ensure the majority of the team can participate.
- **Distractor 3:** Divide the team into two sub-teams based on geography to reduce communication friction and time zone delays.

<details>
<summary>Detailed Remediation</summary>

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | Global teams require "Asynchronous Ops" and "Digital Culture." Supporting varied perspectives requires making communication accessible to everyone. |
| **PMI Mindset** | Inclusion isn't just about being in the meeting; it's about having an equitable voice through an async-friendly model. |
| **The Trap** | Mandating cameras is a reactive move that doesn't address the underlying issue of inequitable communication flow. |
| **Source Link** | `guide/03-team-leadership/building-teams.md` |

</details>

### Question 6
**Enabler:** 4 | **Methodology:** Predictive

**Scenario:**
The Project Sponsor frequently contacts individual developers directly to ask for "quick fixes" or status updates, bypassing the Project Manager. These interruptions are causing context-switching and a 15% increase in team stress. The Project Manager has already mentioned the communication plan in a general meeting, but the behavior continues.

**Question:**
What is the MOST effective way for the Project Manager to represent the voice of the team?

- **Correct:** Meet privately with the Sponsor to explain the impact of interruptions on productivity and reinforce the Work Authorization System.
- **Distractor 1:** Instruct the team to ignore all direct requests from the Sponsor and refer them back to the Project Manager.
- **Distractor 2:** Create a dedicated "Sponsor Support" role within the team to handle all direct requests without involving others.
- **Distractor 3:** Document the interruptions in the Issue Log and present the data at the next Steering Committee meeting.

<details>
<summary>Detailed Remediation</summary>

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | Representing the team involves protecting them from interruptions. The Work Authorization System is a way to control how work begins. |
| **PMI Mindset** | The PM must be the "heat shield" for the team through direct, assertive communication with high-power stakeholders. |
| **The Trap** | Presenting the data at a committee meeting is too passive and delayed for a problem impacting the team right now. |
| **Source Link** | `guide/08-execution/executing-work.md` |

</details>

### Question 7
**Enabler:** 7 | **Methodology:** Hybrid

**Scenario:**
In a hybrid project, the quality assurance (QA) team is struggling to keep up with the agile development team. The QA lead complains that they are often not told when a feature is ready for testing until the very end of the sprint, leading to a bottleneck. The development team claims that they don't have time to update the testing log because they are focused on meeting the sprint goal.

**Question:**
What is the BEST action to establish clear roles and responsibilities?

- **Correct:** Facilitate a session to update the RACI matrix and include QA "Sign-off" as a mandatory part of the Definition of Done.
- **Distractor 1:** Hire additional QA testers to match the velocity of the development team and reduce the bottleneck.
- **Distractor 2:** Instruct the QA team to wait until the end of every two sprints to perform a large batch of regression testing.
- **Distractor 3:** Tell the developers to stop coding three days before the end of the sprint to allow QA to catch up.

<details>
<summary>Detailed Remediation</summary>

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | The "Definition of Done" (DoD) is a critical execution tool. The PM should use a RACI to ensure work flows without quality gaps. |
| **PMI Mindset** | Process problems are solved by clarifying agreements and definitions, not just by adding more resources. |
| **The Trap** | Adding more people might help temporarily, but it doesn't solve the communication breakdown between the two groups. |
| **Source Link** | `guide/08-execution/executing-work.md` |

</details>

### Question 8
**Enabler:** 3 | **Methodology:** Agile

**Scenario:**
A senior developer on an agile team is "cherry-picking" the most interesting and complex tasks from the sprint backlog, leaving repetitive tasks for the junior members. This is causing resentment and preventing the junior members from developing the skills needed for complex work. The senior developer argues that they are the most efficient person for the difficult tasks.

**Question:**
What action should the Project Manager (Scrum Master) take to solve this problem?

- **Correct:** Facilitate a team discussion during the next retrospective to review the team charter and the principle of shared accountability.
- **Distractor 1:** Assign specific tasks to each team member during sprint planning to ensure an even distribution of work.
- **Distractor 2:** Publicly recognize the senior developer's efficiency to motivate the junior members to work harder.
- **Distractor 3:** Remove the senior developer from the team to protect the morale and development of the other members.

<details>
<summary>Detailed Remediation</summary>

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | Agile teams are self-organizing. Solving problems involves referring back to working agreements like the Team Charter. |
| **PMI Mindset** | PMs should use retrospectives to let the team solve their own dynamics. Intervening by assigning tasks destroys self-organization. |
| **The Trap** | Rewarding the senior developer would reinforce the negative behavior and further alienate the rest of the team. |
| **Source Link** | `guide/03-team-leadership/building-teams.md` |

### Question 9
**Enabler:** 6 | **Methodology:** Hybrid

**Scenario:**
A project has transitioned from a predictive model to a hybrid model. The core infrastructure team, which remains predictive, is confused about why the requirements keep changing. They have started to refuse any work requests that are not accompanied by a formal, approved change request from the CCB.

**Question:**
What leadership style should the Project Manager adopt to resolve this conflict?

- **Correct:** Coaching (S2) to explain the "why" behind the hybrid model and facilitate collaboration between the two groups.
- **Distractor 1:** Directing (S1) to mandate that the infrastructure team must accept all requests from the agile team without formal approval.
- **Distractor 2:** Supporting (S3) to allow the teams to find their own way of working without direct management intervention.
- **Distractor 3:** Delegating (S4) since both teams are technically competent and have their own internal leads.

<details>
<summary>Detailed Remediation</summary>

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | The teams are in the "Storming" phase. The Coaching style (S2) is high direction and high support, needed to bridge the gap in understanding. |
| **PMI Mindset** | Hybrid leaders must be "Bridge-Oriented," explaining the system of work while supporting the emotional transition. |
| **The Trap** | Simply supporting is insufficient when there is a fundamental process conflict that requires the PM's facilitation. |
| **Source Link** | `guide/03-team-leadership/team-development.md` |

### Question 10
**Enabler:** 1 | **Methodology:** Predictive

**Scenario:**
During a kickoff, two key functional managers disagree on who has the authority to approve the final safety documentation. This disagreement is creating tension among the team members, and the project schedule is at risk.

**Question:**
What is the FIRST thing the Project Manager should do to establish clear expectations?

- **Correct:** Consult the Project Charter and the organizational governance guidelines to clarify the decision-making authority.
- **Distractor 1:** Ask the Project Sponsor to make a final decision on which functional manager has the authority.
- **Distractor 2:** Facilitate a voting session among the team members to decide which manager they prefer to work with.
- **Distractor 3:** Document the disagreement in the Risk Register and continue with the project until the first milestone.

<details>
<summary>Detailed Remediation</summary>

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | The Project Charter is the "Source of Truth" for authority and governance. PMs must align on purpose and authority early. |
| **PMI Mindset** | Always look at the governance documents (Charter/Plan) before escalating to the Sponsor. |
| **The Trap** | Escalating to the Sponsor is a common reactive mistake. The PM should first check existing documentation. |
| **Source Link** | `guide/03-team-leadership/building-teams.md` |

### Question 11
**Enabler:** 2 | **Methodology:** Agile

**Scenario:**
A Scrum team is struggling to finish their tasks by the end of each sprint. The Project Manager notices that team members wait for the daily standup to report blockers, even when they occur early in the afternoon of the previous day. The team says they don't want to "interrupt the flow of others."

**Question:**
What should the Project Manager do to empower the team to solve problems more effectively?

- **Correct:** Encourage the team to use a "Stop the Line" mentality where impediments are raised and addressed immediately.
- **Distractor 1:** Implement a more detailed status reporting system where team members must update their blockers every four hours.
- **Distractor 2:** Act as the primary contact for all blockers and promise to resolve any issue within two hours of it being reported.
- **Distractor 3:** Schedule a second daily standup in the afternoon to catch any blockers that occurred during the morning.

<details>
<summary>Detailed Remediation</summary>

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | Empowerment involves removing impediments to restore flow. Blockers should be removed immediately rather than waiting for ceremonies. |
| **PMI Mindset** | Agile teams must be proactive. Servant leadership involves coaching the team to manage their own flow efficiently. |
| **The Trap** | Adding more meetings or more reporting adds waste and decreases team autonomy. |

### Question 12
**Enabler:** 5 | **Methodology:** Predictive

**Scenario:**
A project team includes a senior technical expert who frequently dismisses the ideas of younger team members. As a result, the younger members have stopped contributing, and the Project Manager is concerned that the project is missing out on innovative solutions.

**Question:**
What is the BEST action for the Project Manager to take to support varied perspectives?

- **Correct:** Meet with the expert privately to discuss the importance of psychological safety and mentor them on inclusive leadership.
- **Distractor 1:** Publicly reprimand the senior expert during the next meeting to show the team that dismissing ideas is not tolerated.
- **Distractor 2:** Create a separate "innovation task force" that only includes the younger members to work without interference.
- **Distractor 3:** Ignore the behavior as long as the senior expert continues to deliver high-quality technical work on schedule.

<summary>Detailed Remediation</summary>

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | Psychological safety is the #1 predictor of success. Mentoring the expert addresses the root cause while maintaining their contribution. |
| **PMI Mindset** | Manage performance issues privately. The PM should aim to coach behavioral gaps rather than just punishing or ignoring them. |
| **The Trap** | Creating a separate group is a "silo" approach that fails to fix the team's culture and creates "us vs. them" dynamics. |

### Question 13
**Enabler:** 4 | **Methodology:** Hybrid

**Scenario:**
The organization is undergoing a major budget cut, and there are rumors that the project might be cancelled. The team members are anxious, leading to a drop in productivity. The Project Manager has no definitive information from the leadership yet but is being asked by the team for updates.

**Question:**
How should the Project Manager represent the voice of the team in this situation?

- **Correct:** Proactively advocate for the project's value to leadership while being transparent with the team about what is currently known.
- **Distractor 1:** Tell the team that their jobs are safe to maintain morale, even though no such guarantee has been given.
- **Distractor 2:** Instruct the team to focus only on their work and stop asking questions about the budget to prevent distraction.
- **Distractor 3:** Wait until a formal decision is made by the leadership before communicating anything to the team.

### Question 14
**Enabler:** 7 | **Methodology:** Predictive

**Scenario:**
A project is falling behind because team members are unsure of who needs to approve their work. The current RACI chart hasn't been updated to reflect recent staff changes and a change in the quality review process.

**Question:**
What should the Project Manager do to establish clear roles and responsibilities?

- **Correct:** Lead a collaborative session with the current team to update the RACI matrix and confirm everyone's understanding.
- **Distractor 1:** Individually assign approval authority to the most senior person in each functional area and notify the team via email.
- **Distractor 2:** Tell the team to continue as they are for now and wait for the next phase gate to update the project documentation.
- **Distractor 3:** Hire a dedicated Quality Manager to handle all approvals and remove the burden from the technical team.

<details>
<summary>Detailed Remediation</summary>

| Aspect | Details |

### Question 15
**Enabler:** 3 | **Methodology:** Hybrid

**Scenario:**
A hybrid project team is using a Kanban board. The Project Manager notices that the "Testing" column has ten items, while the "In Progress" column has only two. Developers are starting new tasks because they say they are "not testers."

**Question:**
How should the Project Manager solve this problem to maintain the flow of work?

- **Correct:** Facilitate a team meeting to establish "Work in Progress" (WIP) limits and encourage "Swarming" to clear the bottleneck.
- **Distractor 1:** Hire temporary contractors to clear the testing column so the developers can continue with their specialized work.
- **Distractor 2:** Instruct the developers to stop working entirely until the testers have cleared all items in the testing column.
- **Distractor 3:** Update the schedule baseline to account for the longer cycle time and inform the stakeholders.

<details>
<summary>Detailed Remediation</summary>

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | Visual management and removing impediments are essential. WIP limits and swarming are standard tools for managing flow in hybrid environments. |
| **PMI Mindset** | Team members should be "T-shaped," helping in other areas to maintain flow. "Not my job" is an execution anti-pattern. |
| **The Trap** | Hiring more people is expensive and doesn't fix the underlying process issue of uncontrolled work-in-progress. |

### Question 16
**Enabler:** 6 | **Methodology:** Predictive

**Scenario:**
A team is in the "Storming" stage, with two senior engineers constantly arguing over the choice of database technology. Their conflict is beginning to divide the team. The Project Manager has a strong technical background and knows which database is objectively better.

**Question:**
What leadership action should the Project Manager take?

- **Correct:** Facilitate a structured decision-making session where both engineers present data against agreed-upon criteria to reach consensus.
- **Distractor 1:** Use their technical authority to make the final decision immediately to stop the arguing and restore productivity.
- **Distractor 2:** Ask the Project Sponsor to choose the database technology to avoid appearing biased toward either engineer.
- **Distractor 3:** Move one of the engineers to a different project to eliminate the personality clash and restore team harmony.

### Question 17
**Enabler:** 2 | **Methodology:** Hybrid

**Scenario:**
An organization is moving to a hybrid model. The Project Manager wants to empower the team to make more local decisions, but the team members seem afraid to take any initiative, frequently asking for permission for minor changes.

**Question:**
What is the Project Manager's BEST move to foster empowerment?

- **Correct:** Model "Fallibility" by sharing their own past mistakes and creating a "Safe-to-Fail" environment for small experiments.
- **Distractor 1:** Mandate that the team must make at least three independent decisions every week without consulting the Project Manager.
- **Distractor 2:** Delegate all decision-making authority to the team immediately and stop attending their technical planning meetings.
- **Distractor 3:** Reward the first person who makes a successful independent decision with a significant financial bonus.

### Question 18
**Enabler:** 1 | **Methodology:** Agile

**Scenario:**
During a retrospective, the team realizes that their "Definition of Done" is too vague, leading to several stories being returned by the Product Owner for failing to meet basic security standards.

**Question:**
What is the MOST important action for the Project Manager (Scrum Master) to take?

- **Correct:** Facilitate a workshop to refine the Definition of Done to include specific security check-points and acceptance criteria.
- **Distractor 1:** Create a separate "Security Team" to review all work before it is shown to the Product Owner.
- **Distractor 2:** Assign a single "Security Lead" within the team who is responsible for all security-related failures.
- **Distractor 3:** Tell the team to spend an extra two days on every story to ensure that "nothing is missed" in the future.

### Question 19
**Enabler:** 3 | **Methodology:** Predictive

**Scenario:**
A key project resource is consistently working 60 hours a week to keep the project on schedule, while others are working 40 hours. This resource's error rate has doubled in the last month, and they have become irritable.

**Question:**
How should the Project Manager solve this problem?

- **Correct:** Meet with the resource privately to discuss their workload and redistribute some of their tasks to other team members.
- **Distractor 1:** Provide the resource with a special "Achievement" award to recognize their hard work and dedication.
- **Distractor 2:** Hire an additional junior resource to assist the overworked senior person with administrative tasks.
- **Distractor 3:** Instruct the rest of the team to also work 60 hours a week to ensure equity in the workload.

### Question 20
**Enabler:** 5 | **Methodology:** Hybrid

**Scenario:**
A project team is composed of seasoned veterans who prefer traditional documentation and younger developers who prefer informal communication. The veterans feel the younger members are "sloppy," while the younger members feel the veterans are slowing the project down.

**Question:**
What should the Project Manager do to support these varied experiences?

### Question 21
**Enabler:** 7 | **Methodology:** Agile

**Scenario:**
An agile team is consistently missing their sprint goals because they are waiting for "the expert" to finish their part. The team's skills matrix shows that only one person knows how to perform the final integration testing.

**Question:**
What is the BEST way for the Project Manager (Scrum Master) to establish clear roles and responsibilities?

- **Correct:** Facilitate a cross-training plan where the expert mentors other team members on integration testing during the next two sprints.
- **Distractor 1:** Update the RACI to formalize the expert as the only person allowed to perform integration testing to ensure quality.
- **Distractor 2:** Request the HR department to hire another expert in integration testing to eliminate the single point of failure.

### Question 44
**Enabler:** 5 | **Methodology:** Predictive

**Scenario:**
The US creative lead wants "bold and aggressive" colors, while the Japan local lead wants "subtle and harmonious." They are in a deep conflict over the global campaign.

**Question:**
What is the BEST way for the Project Manager to support these varied perspectives?

- **Correct:** Facilitate a "Cultural Intelligence" session to understand color meanings in both markets and find a shared palette.
- **Distractor 1:** Decide in favor of the US lead because headquarters is in the US and they have final brand say.
- **Distractor 2:** Create two separate campaigns with different colors for each market, doubling the project's cost.
- **Distractor 3:** Tell the leads to stop arguing and use the "Standard Corporate Blue" to avoid controversy.

### Question 45
**Enabler:** 6 | **Methodology:** Hybrid

**Scenario:**
A project team has been "Performing," but the scope was expanded and three new inexperienced members joined. Friction is rising.

**Question:**
What leadership style should the Project Manager adopt?

- **Correct:** Shift back to Coaching (S2) to integrate new members and re-establish team norms and standards.
- **Distractor 1:** Stay in a Delegating (S4) style and let the original team members manage the new members.
- **Distractor 2:** Use a Directing (S1) style to mandate a strict bootcamp for new members to catch them up.
- **Distractor 3:** Adopt a Supporting (S3) style to facilitate social gatherings and help the team members bond.

| **Core Logic** | Adding new members often knocks a team from Performing back to Storming. The style must revert to Coaching (S2). |
| **PMI Mindset** | Recognize regression and adapt leadership accordingly. Do not ignore the rising team friction. |
| **The Trap** | Staying in Delegating (S4) when the team has regressed will lead to a total breakdown in productivity. |

### Question 46
**Enabler:** 7 | **Methodology:** Agile

**Scenario:**
The Project Sponsor wants a detailed WBS and Gantt chart for an agile project to see exactly what will be delivered over six months.

**Question:**
What should the Project Manager (Scrum Master) do to establish clear roles?

### Question 47
**Enabler:** 1 | **Methodology:** Hybrid

**Scenario:**
A shared resource is being pulled into syncs and meetings for both teams, leaving them with little time for actual work.

**Question:**
What should the Project Manager do to establish better expectations at the team level?

- **Correct:** Facilitate a session to align the communication plan and allow for asynchronous updates where possible.
- **Distractor 1:** Tell the resource to pick the meeting they feel is most important and skip the others.
- **Distractor 2:** Schedule all project meetings at the same time and force the resource to delegate their attendance.
- **Distractor 3:** Request a second resource from the functional manager so each team has its own dedicated person.

### Question 48
**Enabler:** 2 | **Methodology:** Predictive

**Scenario:**
The Project Manager wants to increase autonomy. Currently, the team needs approval for any technical decision taking more than four hours.

**Question:**
What is the BEST way for the Project Manager to empower the team?

- **Correct:** Increase "Decision Rights" by allowing any technical decision that doesn't impact project triple constraints.
- **Distractor 1:** Tell the team that they can now take eight hours to make a decision before needing approval.
- **Distractor 2:** Delegate all technical decisions to the most senior member and have them approve everyone else's work.
- **Distractor 3:** Remove all approval requirements and tell the team to "do what they think is best."

**Scenario:**
The team discovers an API they were planning to use is deprecated and will shut down in two weeks.

**Question:**
How should the Project Manager (Scrum Master) solve this problem?

- **Correct:** Facilitate an immediate triage session with the team and Product Owner to re-prioritize and address the risk.
- **Distractor 1:** Tell the team to keep working on current stories and deal with the shutdown when it actually happens.
- **Distractor 2:** Cancel the sprint and spend the next two weeks researching alternative APIs.
- **Distractor 3:** Instruct the team to work overtime to finish all stories using the deprecated API before it shuts down.

### Question 50
**Enabler:** 7 | **Methodology:** Predictive

**Scenario:**
Team members are spending 10% of their week filling out forms for a complex Work Authorization System. They complain it is "Bureaucracy."

**Question:**
What should the Project Manager do to establish clearer and more efficient roles?

- **Correct:** Review the Work Authorization process and streamline it to focus only on high-risk or high-cost tasks.
- **Distractor 1:** Tell the team the forms are a mandatory part of compliance and they must continue to fill them out.
- **Distractor 2:** Eliminate the Work Authorization System entirely to increase the team's velocity and morale.
- **Distractor 3:** Hire a "Project Administrator" to fill out all the forms for the team so they can focus on technical work.

##  Key Takeaways for People Task 3

1.  **Safety First**: Psychological safety is the #1 predictor of success. If a team is quiet or hiding mistakes, you are failing as a leader.
2.  **Adapt Your Style**: Leadership isn't a static trait; it's a response to team maturity. Use Tuckman's Model and Situational Leadership (SLII) to match your style to the team's current stage.
3.  **Servant Leadership**: Your primary job is to "clear the path." Whether it's a technical blocker, a functional manager, or a bureaucratic process, if it slows the team down, it's your problem to solve.
4.  **Motivate Intrinsically**: Once fair pay (Hygiene) is met, people are driven by **Autonomy** (Control), **Mastery** (Growth), and **Purpose** (Meaning). Align tasks to these needs.
5.  **Conflict is Normal**: Don't suppress conflict in the "Storming" stage. Facilitate it so the team learns how to reach consensus and move to "Norming."
6.  **Protect the Flow**: Representing the team means protecting them from external "Scope Creep" and stakeholder interruptions. Use the Work Authorization System or Sprint rules as your "Heat Shield."
