### Question 1

<strong>Enabler:</strong> 1 | <strong>Methodology:</strong> Predictive

<strong>Scenario:</strong>
During the initiation phase of a multi-million dollar infrastructure project, the project manager is developing the stakeholder register. The project involves a state government, three local municipalities, and several environmental advocacy groups. A senior executive from the state government has been identified as having high influence but has expressed low interest in the project's day-to-day operations.

<strong>Question:</strong>
According to the stakeholder classification guidelines, which engagement strategy should the project manager primarily employ for this senior executive?

- <strong>Correct:</strong> Keep the stakeholder satisfied by providing regular high-level summaries and ensuring their specific success criteria are met.
- <strong>Distractor 1:</strong> Manage the stakeholder closely by involving them in weekly technical design reviews and detailed status meetings.
- <strong>Distractor 2:</strong> Monitor the stakeholder with minimal effort, providing only the publicly available project newsletters.
- <strong>Distractor 3:</strong> Keep the stakeholder informed by sending detailed daily progress reports and technical documentation.

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | High Power / Low Interest stakeholders fall into the "Keep Satisfied" quadrant. The goal is to ensure their needs are met without overwhelming them with information they find irrelevant. |
| **PMI Mindset** | The PM must adapt the communication style and frequency based on the power/interest mapping to optimize engagement and resource usage. |
| **The Trap** | The trap is assuming a high-power stakeholder needs "Managed Closely," which would actually annoy a low-interest executive. |

### Question 2

<strong>Enabler:</strong> 2 | <strong>Methodology:</strong> Predictive

<strong>Scenario:</strong>
A project manager is leading a global software implementation project. During a one-on-one interview with a functional manager from the finance department, the manager states, "I need to ensure that my team doesn't have to spend more than two hours a week on training for this new system." The project manager notes this in the stakeholder register.

<strong>Question:</strong>
How should this statement be classified in the stakeholder register to best facilitate alignment of expectations later in the project?

- <strong>Correct:</strong> As a stakeholder requirement that defines a constraint on the project's training and transition plan.
- <strong>Distractor 1:</strong> As a stakeholder success criterion that will determine if the project is considered a success by the finance department.
- <strong>Distractor 2:</strong> As a project risk that indicates the finance team may not be sufficiently trained on the new system.
- <strong>Distractor 3:</strong> As a communication preference regarding the frequency of updates about the training schedule.

<summary>Detailed Remediation</summary>

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | Specific constraints or needs stated by stakeholders are "Requirements." In this case, the time limitation is a constraint on how the PM designs the training. |
| **PMI Mindset** | Identifying and classifying expectations correctly allows the PM to address them in the project management plan. |
| **The Trap** | It is tempting to call this a success criterion, but success criteria are outcomes (e.g., "zero errors"), whereas this is a constraint on the process (the training). |

### Question 3

<strong>Enabler:</strong> 3 | <strong>Methodology:</strong> Predictive

<strong>Scenario:</strong>
Two key stakeholders in a construction project have conflicting expectations regarding the final landscaping of a corporate campus. One stakeholder demands a minimalist, low-maintenance design to save on long-term costs, while the other insists on a lush, diverse botanical garden to enhance the company's brand image. The project charter mentions "environmental excellence" as a high-level goal.

<strong>Question:</strong>
What is the most effective first action for the project manager to take to align these stakeholder expectations?

- <strong>Correct:</strong> Facilitate a joint meeting to review the project's strategic goals in the charter and explore options that balance both maintenance costs and branding value.
- <strong>Distractor 1:</strong> Escalate the conflict to the project sponsor and request a final decision on the landscaping design.
- <strong>Distractor 2:</strong> Choose the low-maintenance design as it aligns more closely with the project's budget constraints and cost-efficiency.
- <strong>Distractor 3:</strong> Ask the design team to create two separate plans and have the stakeholders vote on which one they prefer.

<details>
<summary>Detailed Remediation</summary>

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | When expectations conflict, the PM should first facilitate a discussion and use the project's foundational documents (like the Charter) as a "North Star" to find common ground. |
| **PMI Mindset** | The PM acts as a facilitator, seeking win-win solutions or compromises that align with the project's business case and strategic objectives. |
| **The Trap** | Escalating to the sponsor is a premature move; the PM should first attempt to resolve the alignment issue through facilitation. |

### Question 4

<strong>Enabler:</strong> 4 | <strong>Methodology:</strong> Predictive

<strong>Scenario:</strong>
A project manager notices that a junior stakeholder from the procurement department is struggling to understand the impact of the project's new vendor selection criteria on their department's established processes. This misunderstanding is causing delays in contract approvals. The project manager identifies this as a mentoring opportunity.

<strong>Question:</strong>
What is the best way for the project manager to act on this mentoring opportunity to align expectations?

- <strong>Correct:</strong> Schedule a series of brief working sessions with the stakeholder to explain the rationale behind the new criteria and how they support the project's overall goals.
- <strong>Distractor 1:</strong> Ask the procurement department head to provide additional training to the junior stakeholder on standard procurement practices.
- <strong>Distractor 2:</strong> Document the delays in the issue log and report the stakeholder's performance to their functional manager.
- <strong>Distractor 3:</strong> Reassign the procurement tasks to a more experienced stakeholder who already understands the new criteria.

<summary>Detailed Remediation</summary>

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | Mentoring involves direct engagement to build understanding and capability. Explaining the "why" helps align the stakeholder's expectations with the project's needs. |
| **PMI Mindset** | Servant leadership involves identifying gaps in stakeholder understanding and proactively coaching them to ensure project success. |
| **The Trap** | Delegating the training to a functional manager is less effective for project-specific alignment than direct mentoring by the PM. |

### Question 5

<strong>Enabler:</strong> 1 | <strong>Methodology:</strong> Predictive

<strong>Scenario:</strong>
A project manager is working on a high-visibility project that involves several external vendors. One vendor provides a critical component but has a history of poor communication and missed deadlines on other projects. The project manager wants to ensure this vendor is categorized correctly to manage their expectations and performance.

<strong>Question:</strong>
Which classification in the stakeholder register would be most appropriate for this vendor to ensure proper attention is given to their influence?

- <strong>Correct:</strong> Outward influence with a strategy of "Manage Closely" due to the high risk they pose to the critical path.
- <strong>Distractor 1:</strong> External stakeholder with a strategy of "Monitor" since they are contractually obligated to deliver.
- <strong>Distractor 2:</strong> Sideward influence with a strategy of "Keep Informed" as they are a peer organization in the project ecosystem.
- <strong>Distractor 3:</strong> Downward influence with a strategy of "Supportive" because the project team depends on their deliverables.

<details>
<summary>Detailed Remediation</summary>

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | Vendors are "Outward" stakeholders. Given the criticality of their component and their history, they have high power/influence over the project's success and must be managed closely. |
| **PMI Mindset** | The PM must recognize when a stakeholder's potential impact warrants more intensive engagement than their formal position might suggest. |
| **The Trap** | Assuming "External" automatically means "Monitor" or "Keep Informed" ignores the specific risk and influence profile of this critical vendor. |

### Question 6

<strong>Enabler:</strong> 2 | <strong>Methodology:</strong> Predictive

<strong>Scenario:</strong>
During a stakeholder workshop, the project manager realizes that the marketing team expects the project to deliver a full suite of promotional videos, while the project's approved scope only includes the raw footage for the videos. The budget was finalized based on the raw footage only.

<strong>Question:</strong>
What should the project manager do first to address this gap in expectations?

- <strong>Correct:</strong> Review the project charter and approved scope statement with the marketing team to clarify the project's boundaries and budget.
- <strong>Distractor 1:</strong> Submit a change request to increase the budget and include the production of the promotional videos in the scope.
- <strong>Distractor 2:</strong> Negotiate with the project team to see if they can produce the videos within the existing budget and timeline.
- <strong>Distractor 3:</strong> Inform the marketing team that their expectations are unrealistic and that they will need to find their own budget for the videos.

<details>
<summary>Detailed Remediation</summary>

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | When expectations exceed scope, the PM must first return to the approved baseline documents (Charter, Scope Statement) to realign stakeholders with the project's reality. |
| **PMI Mindset** | Managing expectations requires transparency and a firm grounding in the project's authorized boundaries. |
| **The Trap** | Submitting a change request immediately is reactive; the first step is to communicate the current reality and align expectations. |

### Question 7

<strong>Enabler:</strong> 3 | <strong>Methodology:</strong> Agile

<strong>Scenario:</strong>
In an agile project developing a new e-commerce platform, the Product Owner wants to prioritize features that drive immediate revenue, while the Technical Lead insists on prioritizing architectural improvements to ensure long-term scalability. The stakeholders are becoming frustrated with the conflicting priorities in the backlog.

<strong>Question:</strong>
How should the project manager (Scrum Master) facilitate alignment between these stakeholders?

- <strong>Correct:</strong> Facilitate a collaborative session to map the architectural work to future business value, helping the Product Owner understand how scalability enables revenue growth.
- <strong>Distractor 1:</strong> Allow the Product Owner to make the final decision on prioritization, as they are ultimately responsible for the product's value.
- <strong>Distractor 2:</strong> Direct the team to alternate between business features and architectural work in every sprint to ensure both parties are satisfied.
- <strong>Distractor 3:</strong> Escalate the conflict to the Agile Coach or the PMO to provide a standard framework for technical debt vs. feature development.

<details>
<summary>Detailed Remediation</summary>

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | In Agile, the PM facilitates alignment by helping stakeholders see the "Value" in different types of work. Connecting technical debt to business outcomes is key. |
| **PMI Mindset** | Facilitating shared understanding and collaborative decision-making is more effective than making unilateral decisions or just splitting the difference. |
| **The Trap** | While the Product Owner has authority, ignoring the Technical Lead's concerns without facilitation leads to poor long-term outcomes and technical debt. |

### Question 8

<strong>Enabler:</strong> 2 | <strong>Methodology:</strong> Agile

<strong>Scenario:</strong>
During a Sprint Review, several stakeholders express surprise that a specific feature they were expecting was not included in the increment. The Product Owner explains that it was moved down the backlog during the last refinement session due to changing market conditions.

<strong>Question:</strong>
What is the best action for the project manager to take to prevent this misalignment in the future?

- <strong>Correct:</strong> Encourage the Product Owner to involve key stakeholders more frequently in backlog refinement or provide more transparency into the prioritized list.
- <strong>Distractor 1:</strong> Update the Communications Management Plan to require a formal email notification whenever a high-priority item is moved in the backlog.
- <strong>Distractor 2:</strong> Revert the backlog changes and ensure the feature is included in the very next sprint to regain stakeholder trust.
- <strong>Distractor 3:</strong> Explain to the stakeholders that in Agile, the backlog is dynamic and they should expect frequent changes without notice.

<details>
<summary>Detailed Remediation</summary>

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | Agile relies on transparency and frequent engagement. If stakeholders are surprised, the "Pull" communication (visibility into the backlog) or the engagement frequency is failing. |
| **PMI Mindset** | The PM should focus on improving the feedback loops and transparency rather than adding bureaucratic "Push" notifications. |
| **The Trap** | Blaming the Agile methodology ("expect changes without notice") is defensive and fails to address the underlying communication gap. |

### Question 9

<strong>Enabler:</strong> 1 | <strong>Methodology:</strong> Agile

<strong>Scenario:</strong>
A project team is transitioning from a predictive to an agile approach. A senior stakeholder, who is used to receiving detailed Gantt charts and monthly status reports, is now being asked to attend bi-weekly Sprint Reviews. They are resistant and complain that the new process is a "waste of time."

<strong>Question:</strong>
How should the project manager categorize and address this stakeholder's expectations?

- <strong>Correct:</strong> Categorize the stakeholder as "Resistant" in the engagement assessment matrix and use a one-on-one session to demonstrate how Sprint Reviews provide more frequent and tangible value.
- <strong>Distractor 1:</strong> Categorize the stakeholder as "Neutral" and continue to send them the monthly status reports they are used to, alongside the invitation to Sprint Reviews.
- <strong>Distractor 2:</strong> Categorize the stakeholder as "External" to the agile process and exempt them from the meetings, providing a summary report instead.
- <strong>Distractor 3:</strong> Categorize the stakeholder as "High Power / Low Interest" and move them to a strategy of "Keep Satisfied" with minimal engagement.

<details>
<summary>Detailed Remediation</summary>

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | Transitioning stakeholders requires identifying their current state (Resistant) and using targeted engagement (demonstrating value) to move them toward support. |
| **PMI Mindset** | Resistance to change is common; the PM must act as a change agent, educating stakeholders on the benefits of the new way of working. |
| **The Trap** | Continuing old habits (Gantt charts) while trying to be agile (Sprint Reviews) creates confusion and doesn't solve the resistance. |

### Question 10

<strong>Enabler:</strong> 4 | <strong>Methodology:</strong> Agile

<strong>Scenario:</strong>
During a retrospective, the agile team identifies that the lack of domain expertise among the stakeholders is leading to poorly defined user stories and frequent rework. A junior Product Owner is particularly struggling to facilitate effective story-mapping sessions with the business units.

<strong>Question:</strong>
How should the project manager (Scrum Master) act on this mentoring opportunity to align expectations?

- <strong>Correct:</strong> Coach the Product Owner on story-mapping techniques and facilitate the first few sessions jointly to ensure expectations are clearly captured.
- <strong>Distractor 1:</strong> Suggest the team hire a professional business analyst to take over the responsibility of writing user stories from the Product Owner.
- <strong>Distractor 2:</strong> Ask the stakeholders to attend a mandatory "Agile 101" training session to learn how to write better user stories.
- <strong>Distractor 3:</strong> Take over the story-mapping sessions yourself to ensure the project stays on schedule and requirements are aligned.

<details>
<summary>Detailed Remediation</summary>

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | The Scrum Master's role is to coach the team and the Product Owner. Direct mentoring in the specific area of struggle (story mapping) addresses the root cause of the misalignment. |
| **PMI Mindset** | Servant leadership involves empowering others through coaching rather than taking over their responsibilities or adding external resources. |
| **The Trap** | "Taking over" is a common trap that undermines the Product Owner's role and fails to build the team's long-term capability. |
| **Source Link** | guide/04-stakeholder/communication-planning.md |

### Question 11

<strong>Enabler:</strong> 3 | <strong>Methodology:</strong> Agile

<strong>Scenario:</strong>
A project team is using an agile approach for a highly innovative product. One key stakeholder is worried about the lack of a "Fixed Date" for the final release, while another stakeholder is most concerned with the product having a "Fixed Set" of features. The Product Owner is struggling to manage these competing expectations.

<strong>Question:</strong>
What is the best way for the project manager to facilitate alignment here?

- <strong>Correct:</strong> Facilitate a workshop to help stakeholders understand the "Iron Triangle" in an agile context, emphasizing that they can fix either date or scope, but the other must remain flexible to manage quality and risk.
- <strong>Distractor 1:</strong> Propose a hybrid approach where the date is fixed but the scope is managed through agile sprints, ensuring both stakeholders get what they want.
- <strong>Distractor 2:</strong> Create a detailed project schedule with estimated dates for every feature in the backlog to provide the appearance of a fixed plan.
- <strong>Distractor 3:</strong> Tell both stakeholders that in Agile, neither the date nor the scope can be fixed, and they must trust the team's velocity.

<details>
<summary>Detailed Remediation</summary>

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | Aligning expectations often requires educating stakeholders on the fundamental constraints of project management (Scope, Schedule, Cost, Quality). |
| **PMI Mindset** | The PM provides clarity on trade-offs, helping stakeholders make informed decisions about priorities. |
| **The Trap** | Proposing a hybrid approach without first explaining the trade-offs might lead to "fixed date AND fixed scope," which is a recipe for failure. |

### Question 12

<strong>Enabler:</strong> 1 | <strong>Methodology:</strong> Hybrid

<strong>Scenario:</strong>
A project manager is overseeing a project with a predictive foundation (construction of a data center) and an agile execution layer (software deployment on the servers). The IT operations team is highly interested in the software but has no influence over the construction phase.

<strong>Question:</strong>
How should the project manager categorize this IT operations team to effectively align their expectations across the project phases?

- <strong>Correct:</strong> Categorize them as "Keep Informed" during the construction phase and "Manage Closely" as the project transitions into the software deployment phase.
- <strong>Distractor 1:</strong> Categorize them as "High Power / High Interest" throughout the entire project to ensure they are always engaged and ready for the handover.
- <strong>Distractor 2:</strong> Categorize them as "Downward influence" since they are the end-users of the data center and will receive the final product.
- <strong>Distractor 3:</strong> Categorize them as "External" to the construction phase and only add them to the stakeholder register once the agile phase begins.

<details>
<summary>Detailed Remediation</summary>

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | Stakeholder influence and interest change over time. In a hybrid project, the PM must adjust categorization based on the active phase and the stakeholder's relevance to it. |
| **PMI Mindset** | The Stakeholder Register is a living document. Categorization must reflect the current project reality. |
| **The Trap** | Keeping a stakeholder "High Power / High Interest" when they have no influence over the current work is an inefficient use of communication resources. |

### Question 13

<strong>Enabler:</strong> 2 | <strong>Methodology:</strong> Hybrid

<strong>Scenario:</strong>
A hybrid project is using a predictive approach for regulatory compliance reporting and an agile approach for the development of the user interface. A regulator requires a detailed audit trail of all changes, while the agile team prefers lightweight documentation.

<strong>Question:</strong>
How should the project manager align these conflicting documentation expectations?

- <strong>Correct:</strong> Incorporate the regulator's audit trail requirements into the agile team's "Definition of Done" for each user story to ensure compliance is built-in.
- <strong>Distractor 1:</strong> Assign a separate "Compliance Officer" to document the agile team's work after each sprint to avoid slowing down the developers.
- <strong>Distractor 2:</strong> Inform the regulator that the agile portion of the project will use a different documentation standard and provide a summary report at the end.
- <strong>Distractor 3:</strong> Ask the agile team to switch to a fully predictive approach for all documentation to ensure they meet the regulator's expectations.

<details>
<summary>Detailed Remediation</summary>

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | In hybrid projects, "hard" constraints (like compliance) must be integrated into the "flexible" processes (like Agile sprints) to ensure all expectations are met. |
| **PMI Mindset** | The PM finds ways to satisfy high-priority stakeholder needs (regulators) without completely abandoning the benefits of the chosen methodology. |
| **The Trap** | Creating a separate compliance silo (Distractor 1) often leads to late-stage discovery of compliance gaps and rework. |

### Question 14

<strong>Enabler:</strong> 3 | <strong>Methodology:</strong> Hybrid

<strong>Scenario:</strong>
In a hybrid project, the senior leadership (using predictive metrics) is concerned that the project is "behind schedule" because only 20% of the total budget has been spent, even though the agile team has delivered 50% of the high-value features.

<strong>Question:</strong>
What is the most effective way for the project manager to facilitate alignment between the leadership's expectations and the project's actual progress?

- <strong>Correct:</strong> Present a "Hybrid Dashboard" that combines Earned Value Management (EVM) for the predictive components with a Feature Burnup chart for the agile components to show value delivery.
- <strong>Distractor 1:</strong> Translate the agile progress into a traditional Gantt chart format to give the leadership the "percent complete" metrics they are expecting.
- <strong>Distractor 2:</strong> Explain to the leadership that budget spend is not a valid metric for agile projects and they should only focus on the feature delivery.
- <strong>Distractor 3:</strong> Accelerate the budget spend on the predictive components to ensure the project looks "on track" according to the traditional metrics.

<details>
<summary>Detailed Remediation</summary>

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | Hybrid projects require hybrid reporting. The PM must facilitate alignment by providing metrics that speak to both traditional and agile stakeholders. |
| **PMI Mindset** | The PM bridges the gap between different management styles by providing a holistic view of project health and value. |
| **The Trap** | Trying to "force" agile progress into a Gantt chart (Distractor 1) can be misleading and hides the true nature of iterative value delivery. |

### Question 15

<strong>Enabler:</strong> 4 | <strong>Methodology:</strong> Hybrid

<strong>Scenario:</strong>
A project manager in a hybrid environment notices that the functional managers (who follow predictive cycles) are not providing resources to the agile team on time, as they do not understand the urgency of the two-week sprint cycles.

<strong>Question:</strong>
What action should the project manager take to act on this mentoring opportunity and align expectations?

- <strong>Correct:</strong> Host a "Hybrid Awareness" session for functional managers to explain the sprint cadence and the critical role of timely resource availability in an agile execution.
- <strong>Distractor 1:</strong> Escalate the resource delays to the project sponsor and request that the functional managers be penalized for missing sprint deadlines.
- <strong>Distractor 2:</strong> Adjust the agile team's sprint duration to four weeks to better align with the functional managers' slower predictive planning cycles.
- <strong>Distractor 3:</strong> Hire external contractors to replace the internal resources who are being delayed by the functional managers.

<details>
<summary>Detailed Remediation</summary>

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | When misalignment stems from a lack of process understanding, the PM uses mentoring/coaching to bridge the gap and ensure the "ways of working" are understood by all. |

### Question 16

<strong>Enabler:</strong> 1 | <strong>Methodology:</strong> Predictive

<strong>Scenario:</strong>
A project manager is taking over a large-scale enterprise resource planning (ERP) project that is halfway through the execution phase. The previous project manager left an outdated stakeholder register. The new project manager learns that a recently appointed Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) is concerned about the project's data privacy controls.

<strong>Question:</strong>
What is the project manager's most immediate task to ensure the CISO's expectations are aligned with the project?

- <strong>Correct:</strong> Update the stakeholder register with the CISO's information, assess their power and interest, and schedule a meeting to understand their specific security requirements.
- <strong>Distractor 1:</strong> Invite the CISO to the next steering committee meeting to present their concerns to the project sponsor.
- <strong>Distractor 2:</strong> Review the project's security architecture and send a comprehensive report to the CISO to prove that all privacy controls are already in place.
- <strong>Distractor 3:</strong> Ask the project's technical lead to handle all future communications with the CISO to ensure technical accuracy.

| **Core Logic** | When a new key stakeholder is identified, the first step is always to update the stakeholder register and then assess their needs to align expectations. |
| **PMI Mindset** | The PM is proactive in identifying and engaging new stakeholders to prevent late-stage surprises or resistance. |
| **The Trap** | Sending a report (Distractor 2) before understanding the CISO's specific concerns is a "Push" communication that may not address the actual misalignment. |

### Question 17

<strong>Enabler:</strong> 2 | <strong>Methodology:</strong> Predictive

<strong>Scenario:</strong>
During a phase-gate review, a stakeholder from the legal department expresses concern that the project is not following a specific international data protection regulation that was updated recently. The project manager was unaware of this update, as it wasn't in the initial requirements.

<strong>Question:</strong>
How should the project manager handle this identified expectation from the legal stakeholder?

- <strong>Correct:</strong> Document the new regulation as a requirement change in the issue log and initiate the formal change control process to assess the impact on scope and budget.
- <strong>Distractor 1:</strong> Inform the legal stakeholder that since the regulation was updated after the project started, it is outside of the current project's scope.
- <strong>Distractor 2:</strong> Immediately stop all work on the project until the legal requirements are fully analyzed and implemented to avoid non-compliance risks.
- <strong>Distractor 3:</strong> Update the stakeholder register to show that the legal department's interest has increased, but wait until the next phase to address the requirement.

<details>
<summary>Detailed Remediation</summary>

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | New requirements or expectations that impact the baseline must go through the formal Integrated Change Control (ICC) process in a predictive environment. |
| **PMI Mindset** | Compliance and legal requirements are high priority. The PM must assess the impact and follow the established governance for any changes. |
| **The Trap** | Simply telling the stakeholder it's "outside scope" (Distractor 1) ignores the project's obligation to remain compliant and fails to align with the organization's needs. |

### Question 18

<strong>Enabler:</strong> 3 | <strong>Methodology:</strong> Predictive

<strong>Scenario:</strong>
A project manager is facilitating a meeting between the internal software development team and an external hosting provider. The internal team expects "unlimited" server access for testing, while the provider's contract only allows for "controlled" access during specific windows. This misalignment is threatening the testing schedule.

<strong>Question:</strong>
What is the best way for the project manager to facilitate a resolution?

- <strong>Correct:</strong> Review the Service Level Agreement (SLA) with both parties and facilitate a negotiation to define specific, expanded access windows that meet the team's needs within the provider's security constraints.
- <strong>Distractor 1:</strong> Direct the external provider to grant unlimited access to ensure the project stays on schedule, as the project's success is the highest priority.
- <strong>Distractor 2:</strong> Tell the internal team that they must adapt their testing schedule to the existing contract terms as defined by the hosting provider.
- <strong>Distractor 3:</strong> Escalate the issue to the procurement department to renegotiate the entire hosting contract to include unlimited access.

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | Facilitation involves finding a middle ground that respects contractual constraints while meeting project needs. Reviewing the "Source of Truth" (the SLA) is the starting point. |
| **PMI Mindset** | The PM uses negotiation and facilitation to resolve conflicts between internal and external parties without immediately resorting to escalation. |
| **The Trap** | "Directing" a vendor to ignore their contract (Distractor 1) is unprofessional and likely to fail or lead to legal issues. |

### Question 19

<strong>Enabler:</strong> 4 | <strong>Methodology:</strong> Predictive

<strong>Scenario:</strong>
A project manager observes that a functional manager is consistently rejecting the project's change requests because they do not understand how the changes benefit their department. The project manager decides this is a mentoring opportunity to align the manager's expectations with the project's strategic value.

<strong>Question:</strong>
What action should the project manager take?

- <strong>Correct:</strong> Invite the functional manager to a one-on-one session to walk through the project's business case and explain how the requested changes directly support the organization's long-term goals.
- <strong>Distractor 1:</strong> Ask the project sponsor to speak with the functional manager and emphasize the importance of the project to the company's success.
- <strong>Distractor 2:</strong> Include more detailed technical data in future change requests to ensure the functional manager has all the information they need to make a decision.
- <strong>Distractor 3:</strong> Change the project's governance structure so that the functional manager's approval is no longer required for most change requests.

### Question 20

<strong>Enabler:</strong> 1 | <strong>Methodology:</strong> Predictive

<strong>Scenario:</strong>
A project manager is working on a high-stakes merger and acquisition project. There are dozens of stakeholders across both organizations. To manage communication efficiently, the project manager needs to group stakeholders based on their common interests and expectations.

<strong>Question:</strong>
Which tool or technique is most appropriate for this categorization to ensure that the communication plan is targeted correctly?

- <strong>Correct:</strong> Stakeholder Mapping/Representation, such as a Salience Model or a Power/Interest Grid, to identify groups with similar profiles.

### Question 21

<strong>Enabler:</strong> 2 | <strong>Methodology:</strong> Predictive

<strong>Scenario:</strong>
In a large construction project, a community group is concerned about the noise levels during the night. They have not been formally identified as "High Power," but they have a "High Urgency" because their quality of life is being affected immediately.

<strong>Question:</strong>
According to the Salience Model, how should the project manager prioritize this group's expectations?

- <strong>Correct:</strong> As "Distant" or "Demanding" stakeholders who require immediate attention and specific communication to address their urgent concerns.
- <strong>Distractor 1:</strong> As "Low Priority" stakeholders because they lack the organizational power to stop the project or change the budget.
- <strong>Distractor 2:</strong> As "Sponsors" because their high urgency gives them temporary authority over the project's schedule.
- <strong>Distractor 3:</strong> As "Internal Stakeholders" since their concerns are now directly affecting the project's day-to-day operations.

### Question 22

<strong>Enabler:</strong> 3 | <strong>Methodology:</strong> Agile

<strong>Scenario:</strong>
An agile team is working on a product with multiple competing "internal" stakeholders (Sales, Marketing, and Operations). Each group wants their features prioritized in the next sprint, leading to heated arguments during the planning session.

<strong>Question:</strong>
What is the most effective way for the Scrum Master to facilitate alignment of these expectations?

- <strong>Correct:</strong> Facilitate a "Weighted Shortest Job First" (WSJF) or a "Buy a Feature" workshop to help the stakeholders collaboratively rank the backlog based on business value and effort.
- <strong>Distractor 1:</strong> Have the Product Owner make a final list and present it to the stakeholders as a non-negotiable decision.
- <strong>Distractor 2:</strong> Allow the team to decide which features they want to work on based on their technical interest and velocity.
- <strong>Distractor 3:</strong> Increase the team's velocity by adding more developers so that all stakeholders' requests can be met in the same sprint.

### Question 23

<strong>Enabler:</strong> 4 | <strong>Methodology:</strong> Agile

<strong>Scenario:</strong>
An agile project manager notices that the senior leadership team is frequently interrupting the development team during the sprint to ask for status updates or small "emergency" features. This indicates they don't understand the concept of a protected sprint.

<strong>Question:</strong>
How should the project manager act on this mentoring opportunity to align the leadership's expectations?

- <strong>Correct:</strong> Coach the leadership team on the agile principle of self-organization and the importance of the Sprint Review as the formal venue for updates and feedback.
- <strong>Distractor 1:</strong> Set up a real-time automated dashboard that gives leadership access to every developer's task list and progress at any time.
- <strong>Distractor 2:</strong> Reprimand the developers for speaking with the leadership and direct them to ignore all requests that don't come through the Product Owner.

### Question 25

<strong>Enabler:</strong> 2 | <strong>Methodology:</strong> Agile

<strong>Scenario:</strong>
During a Sprint Planning session, a developer asks, "What does 'success' actually look like for this specific feature?" The Product Owner provides a vague answer, and the team seems confused.

<strong>Question:</strong>
What is the best way for the project manager to facilitate the identification of clear stakeholder expectations here?

- <strong>Correct:</strong> Encourage the use of "Acceptance Criteria" for the user story, ensuring they are specific, measurable, and agreed upon by the stakeholders.
- <strong>Distractor 1:</strong> Ask the developer to use their best judgment and then see if the stakeholder likes it during the Sprint Review.
- <strong>Distractor 2:</strong> Tell the Product Owner to write a detailed 10-page functional specification document for the feature before the sprint begins.
- <strong>Distractor 3:</strong> Document the Product Owner's vague answer in the meeting minutes and move on to the next item in the backlog.

### Question 26

<strong>Enabler:</strong> 3 | <strong>Methodology:</strong> Agile

<strong>Scenario:</strong>
An agile team is facing a "Scope Creep" problem where stakeholders are constantly adding "small" items to the sprint backlog after the sprint has already started. This is causing the team to miss their sprint goals.

<strong>Question:</strong>
How should the Scrum Master facilitate a discussion to realign these stakeholders' expectations?

- <strong>Correct:</strong> Use the "Sprint Burndown" chart to show stakeholders how mid-sprint additions impact the team's ability to finish the committed work, and redirect them to the Product Backlog.
- <strong>Distractor 1:</strong> Negotiate with the team to work overtime to accommodate the new requests without missing the original sprint goals.
- <strong>Distractor 2:</strong> Accept the new requests but tell the stakeholders that other, more important features will have to be moved to the next sprint.
- <strong>Distractor 3:</strong> Ban all stakeholders from speaking to the development team during the sprint to prevent them from making any new requests.

### Question 27

<strong>Enabler:</strong> 1 | <strong>Methodology:</strong> Hybrid

<strong>Scenario:</strong>
A project manager is implementing a new HR system. The project follows a predictive approach for data migration and an agile approach for the user interface. The "Data Stewards" from various departments are only concerned with the migration, while the "Employee Experience" team is only concerned with the interface.

<strong>Question:</strong>
How should the project manager categorize these two groups to ensure their expectations are aligned with the relevant project components?

- <strong>Correct:</strong> Group them by "Impact Area" in the stakeholder register, assigning specific engagement owners and communication channels for each group.
- <strong>Distractor 1:</strong> Categorize them all as "Internal Stakeholders" and send the same weekly project update to both groups to ensure transparency.
- <strong>Distractor 2:</strong> Treat the Data Stewards as "High Power" and the Employee Experience team as "Low Power" because data migration is technically more difficult.
- <strong>Distractor 3:</strong> Only engage the Data Stewards during the first half of the project and the Employee Experience team during the second half.

### Question 28

<strong>Enabler:</strong> 2 | <strong>Methodology:</strong> Hybrid

<strong>Scenario:</strong>
In a hybrid project, the "Project Steering Committee" expects a fixed budget and a detailed ROI analysis (Predictive mindset), while the "Product Innovation Lab" expects the freedom to pivot based on user feedback (Agile mindset).

<strong>Question:</strong>
What is the most important action for the project manager to take to align these expectations?

- <strong>Correct:</strong> Define clear "Gated Funding" milestones where the agile team must demonstrate specific value or learning to the Steering Committee to unlock the next round of budget.
- <strong>Distractor 1:</strong> Convince the Steering Committee to adopt a fully agile "Venture Capital" funding model where they provide the entire budget upfront with no strings attached.
- <strong>Distractor 2:</strong> Tell the Innovation Lab that they must provide a full 3-year feature roadmap before they can receive any funding for their agile experiments.
- <strong>Distractor 3:</strong> Maintain two separate project plans and two separate budgets to keep the two groups from conflicting with each other.

<strong>Scenario:</strong>
A hybrid project manager is leading a global rollout. The European teams insist on following a strict "Waterfall" deployment schedule due to labor laws, while the North American teams want to use a "Continuous Deployment" agile model.

<strong>Question:</strong>
How should the project manager facilitate alignment of these regional expectations?

- <strong>Correct:</strong> Facilitate a workshop to develop a "Regional Tailoring" strategy within the Project Management Plan, allowing for different deployment cadences while maintaining a single global reporting standard.
- <strong>Distractor 1:</strong> Mandate a single "Waterfall" deployment for everyone to ensure consistency and easier global management.
- <strong>Distractor 2:</strong> Mandate a single "Agile" deployment for everyone and tell the European teams they must negotiate with their local labor unions to allow it.

<strong>Scenario:</strong>
A project manager is working on a construction project in a sensitive ecological area. Several environmental NGOs have been vocal about their concerns. One group has high influence through the media, while another has high influence through legal challenges.

<strong>Question:</strong>
How should the project manager categorize these two groups in the stakeholder register to prioritize engagement effectively?

- <strong>Correct:</strong> Categorize both as "External" and "Outward" with a "Manage Closely" strategy, but use "Push" communication for the legal group and "Interactive" communication for the media-heavy group.
- <strong>Distractor 1:</strong> Categorize both as "External" and "Sideward" and provide them with the same monthly environmental impact report.
- <strong>Distractor 2:</strong> Treat the legal group as a "Risk" and the media group as a "Stakeholder," keeping their information in separate documents.
- <strong>Distractor 3:</strong> Categorize both as "Monitor" since they do not have direct authority over the project's budget or schedule.

### Question 41

<strong>Enabler:</strong> 3 | <strong>Methodology:</strong> Agile

<strong>Scenario:</strong>
A key stakeholder is consistently unhappy with the product increments shown in the Sprint Reviews, claiming they "aren't what I imagined," even though they meet the agreed-upon acceptance criteria.

<strong>Question:</strong>
How should the project manager facilitate a better alignment of expectations?

- <strong>Correct:</strong> Facilitate more frequent, informal "Mid-Sprint Demos" or "Backlog Refinement" sessions with this specific stakeholder to catch misalignments earlier.
- <strong>Distractor 1:</strong> Tell the stakeholder that since the work meets the acceptance criteria, their feedback is invalid and cannot be addressed in the current sprint.
- <strong>Distractor 2:</strong> Ask the Product Owner to write more detailed and rigid user stories to prevent any room for imagination or interpretation.
- <strong>Distractor 3:</strong> Suggest that the stakeholder be replaced with someone who has a better understanding of the agile process.

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | If the formal cycles (Sprint Reviews) are failing, increasing the frequency and informality of feedback loops (Mid-Sprint Demos) is the standard agile response to misalignment. |
| **PMI Mindset** | The PM should focus on building the relationship and improving the feedback mechanism rather than being defensive. |
| **The Trap** | Rigid user stories (Distractor 2) go against the agile principle of "Responding to Change" and can stifle innovation. |

### Question 42

<strong>Enabler:</strong> 4 | <strong>Methodology:</strong> Agile

<strong>Scenario:</strong>
An agile team is struggling because the "Subject Matter Experts" (SMEs) from the business units are not available to answer questions during the sprint, as they are being prioritized for their day-to-day operational tasks.

<strong>Question:</strong>
How should the project manager act on this mentoring opportunity to align the organization's expectations with the project's needs?

- <strong>Correct:</strong> Mentor the functional managers of the SMEs on the "Cost of Delay" and how their lack of availability is causing rework and extending the project's timeline.
- <strong>Distractor 1:</strong> Train the development team to make their own decisions without the SMEs so the project can move forward faster.
- <strong>Distractor 2:</strong> Request that the project be put on hold until the SMEs can be fully dedicated to the project for at least 20 hours a week.
- <strong>Distractor 3:</strong> Document the lack of SME availability in the risk register and inform the stakeholders that the project will likely be late.

| **Core Logic** | Mentoring functional managers on agile economics (Cost of Delay) helps them understand the value of providing resources and aligns their priorities with the project. |
| **PMI Mindset** | The PM should influence the organizational environment to support the project's chosen methodology. |
| **The Trap** | Making decisions without SMEs (Distractor 1) often leads to a product that doesn't meet the business needs, resulting in failure. |

### Question 43

<strong>Enabler:</strong> 1 | <strong>Methodology:</strong> Agile

<strong>Scenario:</strong>
An agile project manager is working with a large group of "Internal" stakeholders who all have different ideas about the product's vision. The project manager wants to ensure they are categorized correctly to facilitate a consensus.

<strong>Question:</strong>
Which technique is best for aligning these internal stakeholders around a single vision during initiation?

- <strong>Correct:</strong> A "Vision Box" or "Product Vision Statement" workshop where stakeholders collaboratively define the target customer, key benefits, and unique value proposition.
- <strong>Distractor 1:</strong> A detailed "RACI Matrix" that shows who is responsible for every part of the product vision.
- <strong>Distractor 2:</strong> A "Power/Interest Grid" to identify which stakeholder has the most power to decide the vision unilaterally.
- <strong>Distractor 3:</strong> A "Monte Carlo Simulation" to predict which version of the vision is most likely to lead to financial success.

<details>
<summary>Detailed Remediation</summary>

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | Collaborative "Visioning" tools (Vision Box, Vision Statement) are designed to categorize and align diverse stakeholder expectations into a single, cohesive goal. |
| **PMI Mindset** | Shared vision is the foundation of agile success and should be built through collaboration rather than authority. |
| **The Trap** | Using Power/Interest (Distractor 2) to pick a single "winner" ignores the value of consensus and can lead to long-term resistance from other stakeholders. |

### Question 44

<strong>Enabler:</strong> 2 | <strong>Methodology:</strong> Agile

<strong>Scenario:</strong>
A team is using a "Pull" system like Kanban. A senior stakeholder is frustrated because they can't see "when" their specific feature will be finished, as there no fixed sprint schedule.

<strong>Question:</strong>
What is the best way for the project manager to identify and align with this stakeholder's expectations?

- <strong>Correct:</strong> Use a "Lead Time" or "Cycle Time" histogram to provide a data-driven probabilistic estimate of when the feature will likely be completed based on past performance.
- <strong>Distractor 1:</strong> Create a "fake" sprint schedule for this stakeholder to give them the sense of predictability they are looking for.
- <strong>Distractor 2:</strong> Tell the stakeholder that in Kanban, it is impossible to predict dates and they must simply wait until the feature moves to the "Done" column.
- <strong>Distractor 3:</strong> Move the stakeholder's feature to the very top of the "In Progress" column to ensure it is finished as quickly as possible.

<summary>Detailed Remediation</summary>

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | Agile metrics (Lead/Cycle Time) allow for "Probabilistic Forecasting," which aligns stakeholder expectations with the reality of a flow-based system. |
| **PMI Mindset** | The PM uses data to provide realistic transparency and manage expectations without making false promises. |
| **The Trap** | Telling a stakeholder "it's impossible to predict" (Distractor 2) is unprofessional and fails to use the tools available in the methodology. |

### Question 45

<strong>Enabler:</strong> 3 | <strong>Methodology:</strong> Agile

<strong>Scenario:</strong>
During a Sprint Review, a stakeholder from the security department identifies a major vulnerability in the increment that was just demonstrated. The team is defensive, arguing that "Security wasn't in the user story."

<strong>Question:</strong>
How should the project manager facilitate a resolution that aligns everyone's expectations?

- <strong>Correct:</strong> Facilitate a session to update the "Definition of Done" to include security checks, ensuring that security expectations are built into every future increment.
- <strong>Distractor 1:</strong> Tell the security stakeholder that their feedback is too late and should have been provided during the planning session.
- <strong>Distractor 2:</strong> Direct the team to fix the vulnerability immediately, even if it means missing the sprint goal for other features.
- <strong>Distractor 3:</strong> Create a separate "Security Backlog" and tell the team they can work on it whenever they have free time between sprints.

<details>
<summary>Detailed Remediation</summary>

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | The "Definition of Done" (DoD) is the primary tool for aligning global expectations (like security, quality, or compliance) with the team's work. |
| **PMI Mindset** | The PM looks for systemic solutions (updating the DoD) rather than blaming individuals or just fixing the symptom. |
| **The Trap** | Fixing it immediately (Distractor 2) without updating the DoD means the same mistake will likely happen again. |

### Question 46

<strong>Enabler:</strong> 4 | <strong>Methodology:</strong> Agile

<strong>Scenario:</strong>
An agile team is working on a new product for a highly regulated industry. The internal "Compliance Officers" are struggling to understand how to perform their audits in an agile environment where things change every two weeks.

<strong>Question:</strong>
How should the project manager act on this mentoring opportunity to align the officers' expectations?

- <strong>Correct:</strong> Invite the Compliance Officers to participate in "Sprint Planning" and "Sprint Reviews" to see how compliance can be verified incrementally rather than at the very end.
- <strong>Distractor 1:</strong> Tell the Compliance Officers that they need to wait until the final release to perform their audits, as agile doesn't support incremental auditing.
- <strong>Distractor 2:</strong> Provide the officers with a copy of the Agile Manifesto and tell them to find a way to make their auditing process "more agile."
- <strong>Distractor 3:</strong> Hire an external "Agile Compliance Consultant" to handle all interactions with the internal compliance department.

### Question 47

<strong>Enabler:</strong> 1 | <strong>Methodology:</strong> Hybrid

<strong>Scenario:</strong>
A project manager is overseeing a "Smart City" project. The infrastructure (Predictive) is being built by the city's public works department, and the software (Agile) is being developed by a local tech startup. The two groups have very different cultures and expectations.

<strong>Question:</strong>
How should the project manager categorize these two groups in the stakeholder register to facilitate alignment?

- <strong>Correct:</strong> Categorize them as "Sub-teams" with a shared "Interface Agreement" that defines how their distinct methodologies and expectations will overlap.
- <strong>Distractor 1:</strong> Treat the tech startup as an "External Vendor" and the public works department as the "Internal Customer."
- <strong>Distractor 2:</strong> Group them both as "Core Team Members" and require them to follow the same set of project management rules and cadences.
- <strong>Distractor 3:</strong> Only include the public works department in the stakeholder register, as they are the ones who ultimately own the city's infrastructure.

<details>
<summary>Detailed Remediation</summary>

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | In hybrid projects with diverse sub-teams, an "Interface Agreement" (or Working Agreement) is essential for aligning expectations at the points where the methodologies meet. |
| **PMI Mindset** | The PM manages the "White Space" between different teams and methodologies to ensure a cohesive final product. |
| **The Trap** | Forcing them to follow the same rules (Distractor 2) ignores the legitimate reasons why they are using different methodologies in the first place. |

### Question 48

<strong>Enabler:</strong> 2 | <strong>Methodology:</strong> Hybrid

<strong>Scenario:</strong>
In a hybrid project, the "Marketing Team" expects to be able to change the UI design at any time (Agile mindset), but the "Hardware Engineering Team" needs the UI dimensions fixed six months in advance to order the physical screens (Predictive mindset).

<strong>Question:</strong>
What is the most effective way for the project manager to align these expectations?

- <strong>Correct:</strong> Facilitate a workshop to identify the "Last Responsible Moment" for the UI dimensions—the latest possible date the design can change before the hardware order must be placed.
- <strong>Distractor 1:</strong> Tell the Marketing Team that they must fix their UI design now to ensure the hardware can be ordered on time.
- <strong>Distractor 2:</strong> Tell the Hardware Team that they need to find a more flexible screen supplier who can accept changes even after the order is placed.
- <strong>Distractor 3:</strong> Flip a coin to decide which team's expectations will be prioritized, and document the decision in the project charter.

| **Core Logic** | The "Last Responsible Moment" is a key hybrid/lean concept for aligning agile flexibility with predictive constraints. |
| **PMI Mindset** | The PM identifies the critical dependencies and uses them to set realistic boundaries for all stakeholders. |
| **The Trap** | Forcing a decision too early (Distractor 1) limits the value of the agile approach, while ignoring the hardware constraint (Distractor 2) leads to project failure. |

### Question 49

<strong>Enabler:</strong> 3 | <strong>Methodology:</strong> Hybrid

<strong>Scenario:</strong>
A hybrid project is facing a budget cut. The "Predictive" workstream has already spent 80% of its budget, while the "Agile" workstream has only spent 20% but has 70% of its work remaining.

<strong>Question:</strong>
How should the project manager facilitate a discussion with the sponsor to align expectations about the project's scope?

- <strong>Correct:</strong> Present a "Value-Based Analysis" that shows which remaining features (from either workstream) provide the highest ROI, and propose a new scope baseline that maximizes value within the reduced budget.
- <strong>Distractor 1:</strong> Suggest cutting the "Agile" budget by 50% since it has the most money remaining, to protect the "Predictive" work that is almost finished.
- <strong>Distractor 2:</strong> Ask the "Predictive" team to work for free for the last 20% of the project to ensure all scope can be delivered as originally planned.
- <strong>Distractor 3:</strong> Tell the sponsor that the budget cut makes the project impossible and recommend that the entire project be cancelled immediately.

<details>
<summary>Detailed Remediation</summary>

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | In any project, but especially hybrid ones, scope alignment during budget cuts should be driven by "Business Value" and ROI, not just by which methodology has more money left. |
| **PMI Mindset** | The PM acts as a business-minded advisor, helping the sponsor make the best decision for the organization's bottom line. |
| **The Trap** | Cutting the agile budget (Distractor 1) just because it has more money ignores the fact that those features might be the most valuable part of the project. |

### Question 50

<strong>Enabler:</strong> 4 | <strong>Methodology:</strong> Hybrid

<strong>Scenario:</strong>
A project manager in a traditional "Waterfall" company is using a hybrid approach for the first time. They notice that the senior executives are confused by the different types of reports they are receiving.

<strong>Question:</strong>
What action should the project manager take to act on this mentoring opportunity to align the executives' expectations?

- <strong>Correct:</strong> Create an "Executive Hybrid Guide" that explains how to read the new reports and how the two methodologies combine to provide a more holistic view of project health.
- <strong>Distractor 1:</strong> Stop sending the new agile reports and only provide the traditional Waterfall reports that the executives are comfortable with.
- <strong>Distractor 2:</strong> Schedule a mandatory 3-day "Agile Certification" course for all senior executives to ensure they understand the new terminology.
- <strong>Distractor 3:</strong> Tell the executives that if they don't understand the reports, they should hire a consultant to interpret them for them.

###  Alignment Pro-Tips
1. <strong>Source of Truth First:</strong> When expectations conflict, always return to the Project Charter or approved Scope Statement. These are your authorized boundaries.
2. <strong>Dynamic Register:</strong> The Stakeholder Register is never "done." Update it immediately when a new stakeholder appears or an existing one's attitude shifts.
3. <strong>Value over Volume:</strong> In Agile and Hybrid, align expectations by demonstrating value (demos) rather than just sending status reports.
4. <strong>Bridge the Gap:</strong> In Hybrid environments, use "Interface Agreements" or "Gated Funding" to satisfy both predictive governance and agile flexibility.
5. <strong>Mentoring is Engagement:</strong> Use mentoring as a strategic tool to move stakeholders from "Resistant" to "Supportive" by educating them on the project's business case.
