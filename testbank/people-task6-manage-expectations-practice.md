# Practice Exam: People Task 6 - Manage Stakeholder Expectations

### Question 1

<strong>Enabler:</strong> 1 | <strong>Methodology:</strong> Predictive

<strong>Scenario:</strong>
During the initial phase of a large-scale infrastructure project, a key regulatory stakeholder expresses concern that the project will interfere with local wildlife habitats, an expectation not explicitly detailed in the project charter. The project manager needs to ensure this expectation is properly integrated into the project's strategy to avoid future delays.

<strong>Question:</strong>
What is the FIRST action the project manager should take to address this expectation?

- <strong>Correct:</strong> Conduct a one-on-one meeting with the stakeholder to surface and document the specific environmental requirements and impact thresholds.
- <strong>Distractor 1:</strong> Update the risk register to include potential delays from environmental protests and assign a mitigation owner.
- <strong>Distractor 2:</strong> Submit a change request to the Change Control Board to add environmental monitoring to the project scope.
- <strong>Distractor 3:</strong> Refer the stakeholder to the project sponsor to discuss the high-level strategic alignment of the project's goals.

| **Core Logic** | According to the Expectation Management Framework, the first step is to surface expectations explicitly. One-on-one meetings are effective for active listening and building intimacy as part of the Trust Equation. |
| **PMI Mindset** | Always seek to understand before acting or escalating. Documenting the specific expectation is the foundation for alignment. |
| **The Trap** | Updating the risk register is a later step; you must first understand what the expectation actually is before you can assess its risk. |

### Question 2

<strong>Enabler:</strong> 3 | <strong>Methodology:</strong> Agile

<strong>Scenario:</strong>
A project team is halfway through a sprint when a senior executive, who hasn't attended previous reviews, expresses disappointment that the product's user interface does not match their vision of "modern aesthetics." The executive's feedback suggests their expectations for the visual design are significantly different from the current development path.

<strong>Question:</strong>
How should the project manager (Scrum Master) respond to this gap in expectations?

- <strong>Correct:</strong> Invite the executive to the next Sprint Review to provide direct feedback on the working increment and facilitate a discussion with the Product Owner.
- <strong>Distractor 1:</strong> Immediately halt the current sprint and conduct a redesign workshop to incorporate the executive's visual preferences.
- <strong>Distractor 2:</strong> Ask the Product Owner to update the Definition of Done to include "modern aesthetics" as a mandatory criterion for all stories.
- <strong>Distractor 3:</strong> Request the team to create a separate prototype specifically for the executive to approve before continuing with the backlog.

| **Core Logic** | In Agile, Sprint Reviews are the primary mechanism for continuous validation and expectation monitoring. It allows for course correction based on working software rather than abstract concepts. |
| **PMI Mindset** | Use established ceremonies to manage engagement. The Product Owner is responsible for the backlog, but stakeholders provide the feedback necessary for alignment. |
| **The Trap** | Halting a sprint is an extreme measure; Agile relies on the feedback loop at the end of the iteration to adjust the backlog. |

### Question 3

<strong>Enabler:</strong> 2 | <strong>Methodology:</strong> Hybrid

<strong>Scenario:</strong>
A project uses a predictive approach for hardware procurement and an agile approach for software development. During a monthly steering committee meeting, the Finance Director expresses concern that the software features are not being delivered in a sequence that maximizes early return on investment (ROI), which was their primary expectation.

<strong>Question:</strong>
What should the project manager do to align project outcomes with the Finance Director's expectations?

- <strong>Correct:</strong> Facilitate a session between the Finance Director and the Product Owner to re-prioritize the product backlog based on business value and ROI.
- <strong>Distractor 1:</strong> Update the schedule baseline to reflect the Finance Director's desired delivery dates for all software modules.
- <strong>Distractor 2:</strong> Create a detailed work breakdown structure (WBS) for the software component to provide more visibility into the delivery sequence.
- <strong>Distractor 3:</strong> Suggest that the Finance Director reviews the monthly status reports which detail the cost performance index (CPI) and schedule performance.

<details>

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | Aligning outcomes requires adjusting the delivery strategy. In hybrid/agile environments, this is done through backlog prioritization focused on business value. |
| **PMI Mindset** | The project manager facilitates alignment between stakeholders and the product vision. Business value is the primary driver for prioritization in modern PM. |
| **The Trap** | Updating the schedule baseline is a predictive response that doesn't address the underlying need for value-based sequencing in the agile portion of the project. |

### Question 4

<strong>Enabler:</strong> 1 | <strong>Methodology:</strong> Predictive

<strong>Scenario:</strong>
A project manager is taking over a project in execution. While reviewing the stakeholder register, the project manager notices that several department heads are listed as "Neutral," but rumors suggest they are unhappy with the project's impact on their team's daily operations.

<strong>Question:</strong>
What is the BEST action for the project manager to take next?

- <strong>Correct:</strong> Conduct 1:1 "listening" meetings with each department head to perform a root cause analysis of their concerns.
- <strong>Distractor 1:</strong> Update the stakeholder engagement plan to increase the frequency of project status emails to these department heads.
- <strong>Distractor 2:</strong> Invite the department heads to the next project board meeting to publicly voice their concerns to the sponsor.
- <strong>Distractor 3:</strong> Re-classify the department heads as "Resistant" in the stakeholder register and update the risk register accordingly.

<details>
<summary>Detailed Remediation</summary>

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | When engagement is slipping or expectations are unclear, 1:1 check-ins are essential for relationship building and surfacing deep-seated concerns. |
| **PMI Mindset** | Radical transparency and active listening are pillars of trust. Identifying the root cause of resistance is the first step in managing it. |
| **The Trap** | Increasing emails (communication) is not the same as engagement. Without understanding the concern, more emails might increase frustration. |

### Question 5

<strong>Enabler:</strong> 2 | <strong>Methodology:</strong> Agile

<strong>Scenario:</strong>
A stakeholder constantly asks for status updates via phone calls and instant messages, despite having access to the team's Kanban board and automated dashboards. The team feels these interruptions are impacting their velocity.

<strong>Question:</strong>
How should the project manager address this behavior to maintain alignment with the project's working agreements?

- <strong>Correct:</strong> Meet with the stakeholder to understand why the existing dashboards are not meeting their needs and provide training on how to interpret the visual data.
- <strong>Distractor 1:</strong> Inform the stakeholder that they are only allowed to receive updates during the formal Sprint Review sessions.
- <strong>Distractor 2:</strong> Assign a team member to spend one hour each day providing a personalized report to this specific stakeholder.
- <strong>Distractor 3:</strong> Escalate the stakeholder's behavior to the Product Owner as an impediment to the team's self-organization.

<details>
<summary>Detailed Remediation</summary>

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | Monitoring communications ensures people get the right info. If existing reports aren't used, the PM must investigate why (root cause) and tailor the approach. |
| **PMI Mindset** | Respect the team's flow while serving the stakeholder's need for information. Education and tailoring are better than rigid enforcement. |
| **The Trap** | Simply banning the stakeholder from asking questions ignores the underlying need for information and could damage trust. |

### Question 6

<strong>Enabler:</strong> 3 | <strong>Methodology:</strong> Predictive

<strong>Scenario:</strong>
A project has a strict cost baseline. During a progress review, the project manager identifies that the Cost Performance Index (CPI) is 0.85 and the Schedule Performance Index (SPI) is 1.10. The sponsor's primary expectation is to stay within the original budget.

<strong>Question:</strong>
What is the MOST appropriate action for the project manager?

- <strong>Correct:</strong> Perform a root cause analysis of the cost variance and present options to the sponsor, including potential scope reductions to protect the budget.
- <strong>Distractor 1:</strong> Immediately stop all non-essential work and redirect resources to the critical path to improve the SPI further.
- <strong>Distractor 2:</strong> Submit a change request to increase the budget by 15% to match the current CPI trend and ensure project completion.
- <strong>Distractor 3:</strong> Tell the team to reduce quality inspections to save costs and bring the CPI back to 1.0.

<details>
<summary>Detailed Remediation</summary>

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | When performance deviates, the PM must analyze (RCA) and provide decision-ready information (options) to the authority (Sponsor) based on their priorities. |
| **PMI Mindset** | "No surprises" is a hallmark of trust. Transparency about the budget overrun and proactive management of options are required. |
| **The Trap** | Increasing the budget without analysis or options is poor governance; reducing quality is never a recommended PMI path. |

### Question 7

<strong>Enabler:</strong> 1 | <strong>Methodology:</strong> Hybrid

<strong>Scenario:</strong>
In a hybrid project, the business stakeholders are accustomed to detailed monthly reports, but the development team is using a burnup chart to track progress. The stakeholders are confused and believe the project is behind because the burnup chart doesn't show "percent complete" for the entire project.

<strong>Question:</strong>
What should the project manager do to manage these expectations?

- <strong>Correct:</strong> Create a hybrid dashboard that translates the burnup data into a milestone-based progress view that aligns with the stakeholders' mental model.
- <strong>Distractor 1:</strong> Mandate that the team stops using agile metrics and switches back to traditional Gantt chart reporting for all project components.
- <strong>Distractor 2:</strong> Tell the stakeholders that they must attend a three-day training course on agile methodologies before they can receive any more status updates.
- <strong>Distractor 3:</strong> Continue using the burnup chart as-is, explaining that it is the most accurate way to represent progress in an adaptive environment.

<details>
<summary>Detailed Remediation</summary>

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | PMs must tailor communication to the audience. Translating technical or agile data into business-relevant information (WPI to WPR) is a core control function. |
| **PMI Mindset** | Meet stakeholders where they are. Effective communication is about the *receiver's* understanding, not just the sender's method. |
| **The Trap** | Forcing stakeholders to adapt to the team's metrics without bridge-building leads to frustration and a perceived loss of control. |

### Question 8

<strong>Enabler:</strong> 2 | <strong>Methodology:</strong> Agile

<strong>Scenario:</strong>
A Product Owner keeps adding high-priority stories to the middle of a sprint, claiming they are "critical customer expectations." The team is becoming frustrated as they cannot finish the work they committed to during sprint planning.

<strong>Question:</strong>
As the Scrum Master, what is the BEST way to maintain the alignment of outcomes with expectations while protecting the team?

- <strong>Correct:</strong> Facilitate a discussion with the Product Owner about the impact of mid-sprint changes on velocity and suggest adding the new items to the backlog for the next sprint.
- <strong>Distractor 1:</strong> Direct the team to work overtime to ensure all new stories and original commitments are completed by the end of the sprint.
- <strong>Distractor 2:</strong> Inform the Product Owner that once a sprint starts, no changes are allowed under any circumstances per the Scrum Guide.
- <strong>Distractor 3:</strong> Automatically extend the sprint duration by one week every time a "critical" story is added to ensure completion.

<details>
<summary>Detailed Remediation</summary>

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | Expectation management involves validating expectations against reality (team capacity). Mid-sprint changes disrupt flow and predictability. |
| **PMI Mindset** | Protect the team's process while collaborating with the Product Owner to ensure value delivery. Use retrospectives and 1:1s to address process violations. |
| **The Trap** | Overtime is not a sustainable solution and violates the agile principle of sustainable pace. |

### Question 9

<strong>Enabler:</strong> 3 | <strong>Methodology:</strong> Predictive

<strong>Scenario:</strong>
A project has reached a major milestone, and the deliverable has been handed over for User Acceptance Testing (UAT). A key stakeholder refuses to sign off, stating, "I thought it would do more than this," even though the deliverable meets all documented requirements.

<strong>Question:</strong>
What should the project manager have done differently to avoid this situation?

- <strong>Correct:</strong> Conducted regular demos of the intermediate products to visualize progress and "surface" implicit expectations early.
- <strong>Distractor 1:</strong> Ensured that the stakeholder was the one who personally wrote every requirement in the project's scope statement.
- <strong>Distractor 2:</strong> Provided a more detailed RACI matrix that clearly defined the stakeholder's role as a "Consulted" rather than "Accountable" party.
- <strong>Distractor 3:</strong> Included a penalty clause in the project charter for any stakeholder who delays the sign-off process without technical justification.

<details>
<summary>Detailed Remediation</summary>

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | The Expectation Management Framework emphasizes "Visualize Progress" and "Surface Expectations." Demos are the best way to bridge the gap between "documented requirements" and "mental models." |
| **PMI Mindset** | Continuous validation, even in predictive projects, prevents major "expectation shocks" at the end of the project. |
| **The Trap** | Even if a stakeholder writes the requirements, their *expectation* of how those requirements will look in reality can drift. |

### Question 10

<strong>Enabler:</strong> 1 | <strong>Methodology:</strong> Agile

<strong>Scenario:</strong>
A new stakeholder joins the project mid-way through the development of a complex AI-driven tool. They have a history of being highly resistant to AI automation in their previous roles.

<strong>Question:</strong>
What is the FIRST thing the project manager should do to manage this stakeholder's expectations?

- <strong>Correct:</strong> Review the stakeholder register and update the stakeholder engagement plan after holding an introductory meeting to understand their specific fears.
- <strong>Distractor 1:</strong> Send them the project charter and the latest three status reports to ensure they are fully caught up on the project's progress.
- <strong>Distractor 2:</strong> Ask the project sponsor to speak with the new stakeholder to ensure they understand that the project is a high priority for the organization.
- <strong>Distractor 3:</strong> Ignore the stakeholder's past history and wait for them to express a concern before taking any specific engagement actions.

<details>
<summary>Detailed Remediation</summary>

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | Resistance is often a symptom of unmanaged fear. The first step is to identify the root cause through direct engagement and update the engagement strategy accordingly. |
| **PMI Mindset** | Be proactive with new stakeholders. Use the "Resistance Diagnosis Framework" to categorize their concerns and plan interventions. |
| **The Trap** | Sending documents is "communication," not "engagement." It doesn't address the emotional or psychological root of the resistance. |

### Question 11

<strong>Enabler:</strong> 2 | <strong>Methodology:</strong> Predictive

<strong>Scenario:</strong>
During a status meeting, a project manager realizes that two key stakeholders have conflicting expectations regarding the final quality standards of the project. One prioritizes "speed to market," while the other prioritizes "zero-defect reliability."

<strong>Question:</strong>
What is the BEST way for the project manager to resolve this conflict and align outcomes?

- <strong>Correct:</strong> Facilitate a trade-off analysis session with both stakeholders to define and document the acceptable quality thresholds and "Definition of Done."
- <strong>Distractor 1:</strong> Choose the "zero-defect" standard as it is always safer for the project manager's professional reputation.
- <strong>Distractor 2:</strong> Escalate the conflict to the project sponsor and ask them to make a final decision on which stakeholder's expectation is more important.
- <strong>Distractor 3:</strong> Alternate between the two standards for different deliverables to ensure both stakeholders feel partially satisfied.

<details>
<summary>Detailed Remediation</summary>

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | Aligning early involves addressing gaps before they become conflicts. A trade-off analysis helps stakeholders understand constraints and reach a consensus. |
| **PMI Mindset** | The PM is a facilitator. Use data and constraints (Triple Constraint) to help stakeholders make informed decisions about priorities. |
| **The Trap** | Escalation should only happen after the PM has tried to facilitate a resolution; choosing one side arbitrarily damages the relationship with the other. |
| **Source Link** | guide/04-stakeholder/stakeholder-engagement.md |

### Question 12

<strong>Enabler:</strong> 3 | <strong>Methodology:</strong> Hybrid

<strong>Scenario:</strong>
A project's steering committee receives a monthly report showing all green status indicators. However, an informal survey of end-users reveals significant dissatisfaction with the upcoming change, citing a lack of training and clear communication about "WIIFM" (What's In It For Me).

<strong>Question:</strong>
What does this situation indicate about the project manager's monitoring process?

- <strong>Correct:</strong> The monitoring process is focused on work performance data but is failing to monitor stakeholder engagement and sentiment effectively.
- <strong>Distractor 1:</strong> The project is performing exceptionally well, and the end-user dissatisfaction is a natural part of any organizational change.
- <strong>Distractor 2:</strong> The communication plan is being followed perfectly because the steering committee is receiving their reports on time.
- <strong>Distractor 3:</strong> The end-users are not "key stakeholders," so their satisfaction is not a primary metric for project success.

<details>
<summary>Detailed Remediation</summary>

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | Monitoring includes measuring engagement effectiveness and adjusting strategy. "Green" reports that hide user resistance are a failure of sentiment tracking. |
| **PMI Mindset** | Look beyond the "hard" data of schedule and cost. Stakeholder sentiment is a leading indicator of project risk and long-term success. |
| **The Trap** | Following a plan (Communication Plan) that isn't producing the desired result (Engagement) means the plan needs to be monitored and adjusted. |

### Question 13

<strong>Enabler:</strong> 1 | <strong>Methodology:</strong> Agile

<strong>Scenario:</strong>
An agile team is working on a new mobile app. The Product Owner informs the team that a major competitor just released a feature that our app doesn't have, and the "market expectation" has shifted overnight.

<strong>Question:</strong>
How should the project manager (Scrum Master) help the team respond to this new expectation?

- <strong>Correct:</strong> Support the Product Owner in conducting a backlog refinement session to assess the value of adding the new feature in the next iteration.
- <strong>Distractor 1:</strong> Tell the team to start working on the new feature immediately to ensure they are not left behind by the competitor.
- <strong>Distractor 2:</strong> Advise the Product Owner that changing the backlog mid-release is "scope creep" and should be avoided to protect the project's stability.
- <strong>Distractor 3:</strong> Update the risk register to note the competitor's new feature and wait for the end-of-project retrospective to discuss it.

<details>
<summary>Detailed Remediation</summary>

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | Agile is designed for "Continuous Validation" and responding to change. Market shifts are identified as new expectations that must be refined and prioritized. |
| **PMI Mindset** | Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Use the established process of refinement and planning to incorporate changes. |
| **The Trap** | Working on it "immediately" without refinement or prioritization disrupts the current sprint and ignores the Product Owner's role. |
| **Source Link** | guide/04-stakeholder/stakeholder-engagement.md |

### Question 14

<strong>Enabler:</strong> 2 | <strong>Methodology:</strong> Predictive

<strong>Scenario:</strong>
A project manager has documented all stakeholder expectations in an "Expectations Matrix." During a mid-project review, it becomes clear that the project's budget will not support one of the non-essential expectations previously agreed upon.

<strong>Question:</strong>
What is the BEST action for the project manager to take to maintain alignment?

- <strong>Correct:</strong> Meet with the affected stakeholders to explain the budget constraints, show the impact analysis, and negotiate a revised expectation or deferral.
- <strong>Distractor 1:</strong> Quietly remove the expectation from the project scope and hope the stakeholders don't notice until the very end of the project.
- <strong>Distractor 2:</strong> Request additional funding from the management reserve to ensure all expectations, even non-essential ones, are met to maintain stakeholder happiness.
- <strong>Distractor 3:</strong> Tell the stakeholders that the project charter takes precedence and their non-essential expectations are no longer valid.

<details>
<summary>Detailed Remediation</summary>

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | When reality changes (budget constraints), the PM must "reset expectations quickly" through radical transparency and negotiation. |
| **PMI Mindset** | Trust is built through reliability and intimacy. Hiding a change (lack of transparency) or being rigid (lack of empathy) destroys trust. |
| **The Trap** | Using management reserve for non-essential expectations that were previously agreed upon but are now unfeasible is poor resource management. |

### Question 15

<strong>Enabler:</strong> 3 | <strong>Methodology:</strong> Hybrid

<strong>Scenario:</strong>
A project manager is using a Cumulative Flow Diagram (CFD) to monitor the progress of a hybrid project's software component. They notice the "Testing" band is widening significantly over the last three weeks, while the "Done" band remains flat. Stakeholders are expecting a release in two weeks.

<strong>Question:</strong>
What is the MOST important action for the project manager to take regarding stakeholder expectations?

- <strong>Correct:</strong> Communicate the bottleneck to stakeholders immediately and provide a revised forecast based on the current cycle time and flow stability.
- <strong>Distractor 1:</strong> Ask the developers to start working on new features to ensure the "In Progress" band also continues to grow.
- <strong>Distractor 2:</strong> Re-baseline the schedule immediately to hide the delay from the stakeholders until the testing bottleneck is resolved.
- <strong>Distractor 3:</strong> Ignore the CFD trend as it is an agile metric and focus on the milestone dates in the predictive portion of the project plan.

<details>
<summary>Detailed Remediation</summary>

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | CFD widening in a column indicates a bottleneck. "No Surprises" means the PM must communicate this trend as an early warning of a missed deadline. |
| **PMI Mindset** | Use visual progress indicators to drive honest conversations. A widening band is a leading indicator that the "Done" date is at risk. |
| **The Trap** | Re-baselining to "hide" a delay is unethical and violates the principle of radical transparency. |

### Question 16

<strong>Enabler:</strong> 1 | <strong>Methodology:</strong> Predictive

<strong>Scenario:</strong>
During a project kick-off, a stakeholder asks, "How will this project affect my department's annual bonus structure?" The project manager realizes this is a personal expectation that was not part of the business case or project planning.

<strong>Question:</strong>
What should the project manager do with this information?

- <strong>Correct:</strong> Document the concern in the stakeholder register and set up a follow-up meeting with the stakeholder and HR to clarify the project's impact on bonuses.
- <strong>Distractor 1:</strong> Tell the stakeholder that personal bonuses are not part of the project's scope and refuse to discuss the matter further.
- <strong>Distractor 2:</strong> Add a new project objective to "Ensure all department bonuses are protected" to keep the stakeholder supportive.
- <strong>Distractor 3:</strong> Inform the stakeholder that their question is inappropriate for a project kick-off and ask them to focus on the project's technical goals.

<details>
<summary>Detailed Remediation</summary>

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | Managing expectations starts with "Surfacing" them. Even if an expectation is outside the PM's direct control, it must be acknowledged and addressed to maintain trust. |
| **PMI Mindset** | Address the "WIIFM" (What's In It For Me) for stakeholders. If they fear a negative personal impact, they will likely become resistant. |
| **The Trap** | Dismissing a personal concern as "out of scope" is a common mistake that leads to silent withdrawal or active opposition. |

### Question 17

<strong>Enabler:</strong> 2 | <strong>Methodology:</strong> Agile

<strong>Scenario:</strong>
An agile team is consistently delivering its committed story points, but the customer is still unhappy during Sprint Reviews, stating that the features "don't feel right" for the end-users.

<strong>Question:</strong>
Which action should the Scrum Master suggest to the Product Owner to better align the outcomes with customer expectations?

- <strong>Correct:</strong> Increase the frequency of user feedback by including actual end-users in the Sprint Reviews or conducting mid-sprint "hallway usability tests."
- <strong>Distractor 1:</strong> Tell the team to work harder on their technical excellence so that the features are of higher quality, even if the scope is the same.
- <strong>Distractor 2:</strong> Ask the customer to provide a more detailed "Requirements Specification Document" instead of using user stories.
- <strong>Distractor 3:</strong> Change the team's velocity targets to be more aggressive so that more features are delivered in each sprint.

<details>
<summary>Detailed Remediation</summary>

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | When the "what" is being delivered but the "how" or "why" is missing the mark, the answer is to increase the frequency of involvement and feedback loops. |
| **PMI Mindset** | Stakeholders are participants, not observers. Direct feedback from end-users is the most effective way to correct course on user experience. |
| **The Trap** | Velocity is a measure of capacity, not quality or "user feel." Delivering more of the wrong thing faster doesn't solve the problem. |

### Question 18

<strong>Enabler:</strong> 3 | <strong>Methodology:</strong> Predictive

<strong>Scenario:</strong>
A project manager is monitoring the project's risks and notices that a "Supportive" stakeholder's engagement has slipped to "Neutral" after their request for a specific reporting format was denied due to time constraints.

<strong>Question:</strong>
What is the BEST way to respond to this change in engagement?

- <strong>Correct:</strong> Re-evaluate the communications plan to see if a compromise can be reached that meets the stakeholder's reporting needs without over-burdening the team.
- <strong>Distractor 1:</strong> Accept that not all stakeholders can be kept supportive and focus on the ones who are still actively helping the project.
- <strong>Distractor 2:</strong> Escalate the stakeholder's lack of support to their manager and ask them to remind the stakeholder of the project's importance.
- <strong>Distractor 3:</strong> Offer to include the stakeholder in more meetings to make up for the fact that they are not getting the reports they wanted.

<details>
<summary>Detailed Remediation</summary>

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | Engagement slippage is a leading indicator of risk. Responding involves "Direct engagement + plan updates" (Stakeholder Engagement or Communications Plan). |
| **PMI Mindset** | Use reciprocity. By trying to meet their reporting needs (even partially), you show that you value their input and care about their perspective. |
| **The Trap** | Inviting someone to *more* meetings is often a punishment, not a reward, especially if they are already feeling overwhelmed or unheard. |

### Question 19

<strong>Enabler:</strong> 1 | <strong>Methodology:</strong> Hybrid

<strong>Scenario:</strong>
A project manager is using a "WIIFM Mapping Template" to prepare for a meeting with a resistant Finance Manager. The Finance Manager is worried that the new automated system will lead to errors that they will be held accountable for.

<strong>Question:</strong>
Based on the Trust Equation, which factor should the project manager focus on to build trust with this stakeholder?

- <strong>Correct:</strong> Intimacy—by creating a safe space for the Finance Manager to share their specific fears and ensuring their concerns are addressed in the test plan.
- <strong>Distractor 1:</strong> Credibility—by showing the Finance Manager the project manager's PMP certification and years of experience with similar systems.
- <strong>Distractor 2:</strong> Reliability—by promising that the system will be 100% error-free on the first day of launch.
- <strong>Distractor 3:</strong> Self-Orientation—by explaining how successful this project will make the project manager's own career look to the executives.

<details>
<summary>Detailed Remediation</summary>

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | Intimacy in the Trust Equation refers to making the stakeholder feel safe sharing fears. Addressing these fears in the test plan validates their concerns. |
| **PMI Mindset** | High self-orientation destroys trust. Focusing on the stakeholder's needs (low self-orientation) and creating safety (intimacy) builds it. |
| **The Trap** | Credibility is important, but it doesn't address the stakeholder's *fear*. Promising 100% error-free is unrealistic and damages reliability. |

### Question 20

<strong>Enabler:</strong> 2 | <strong>Methodology:</strong> Agile

<strong>Scenario:</strong>
A Product Owner and the development team have different "mental pictures" of what a "ready" user story looks like. This is leading to wasted time during sprint planning and missed expectations during the review.

<strong>Question:</strong>
What is the MOST effective tool to align these expectations?

- <strong>Correct:</strong> Collaboratively define and document a "Definition of Ready" (DoR) that specifies the criteria a story must meet before being pulled into a sprint.
- <strong>Distractor 1:</strong> Ask the Scrum Master to write all the user stories to ensure they are consistent and meet the team's technical standards.
- <strong>Distractor 2:</strong> Use a more complex project management software that forces the Product Owner to fill out 20 different fields for every story.
- <strong>Distractor 3:</strong> Increase the length of the Sprint Planning meeting to 8 hours to ensure every detail of every story is discussed in depth.

<details>
<summary>Detailed Remediation</summary>

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | Aligning early involves documenting agreements. A "Definition of Ready" (DoR) ensures shared understanding of what is needed to start work. |
| **PMI Mindset** | Use quality gates (DoR, DoD) to prevent "undone work" and "inconsistent quality" caused by mismatched expectations. |
| **The Trap** | The Scrum Master shouldn't write stories (that's the PO's role); more complex software often increases "Self-Orientation" and reduces "Intimacy." |

### Question 21

<strong>Enabler:</strong> 3 | <strong>Methodology:</strong> Predictive

<strong>Scenario:</strong>
A project manager is reviewing the "Work Performance Information" (WPI) for a project and notes that while the project is technically on track, the "Stakeholder Satisfaction Survey" results have dropped from 90% to 70% in the last quarter.

<strong>Question:</strong>
What should the project manager do FIRST?

- <strong>Correct:</strong> Analyze the survey comments to identify specific themes of dissatisfaction and hold a focus group with a subset of stakeholders.
- <strong>Distractor 1:</strong> Update the project's RAG status to "Red" and alert the sponsor that the project is failing to meet its objectives.
- <strong>Distractor 2:</strong> Disregard the survey results as "subjective data" and focus on the "objective" CPI and SPI metrics which are still positive.
- <strong>Distractor 3:</strong> Immediately increase the frequency of all project communications by 50% to ensure stakeholders feel more "informed."

### Question 22

<strong>Enabler:</strong> 1 | <strong>Methodology:</strong> Hybrid

<strong>Scenario:</strong>
In a hybrid project, the hardware team is using a "Critical Path" schedule, while the software team is using a "Product Backlog." A major delay in hardware delivery is going to impact the software team's ability to test their next increment.

<strong>Question:</strong>
How should the project manager manage the software team's expectations regarding this delay?

- <strong>Correct:</strong> Transparently communicate the hardware delay, assess the impact on the software roadmap, and help the team re-prioritize stories that don't depend on the hardware.
- <strong>Distractor 1:</strong> Tell the software team to "keep working as planned" and hope the hardware team can find a way to crash their schedule to catch up.
- <strong>Distractor 2:</strong> Blame the hardware team during the software team's daily standup to ensure the software team knows it's not their fault.
- <strong>Distractor 3:</strong> Ask the software team to work on "documentation only" for the next month until the hardware arrives.

### Question 23

<strong>Enabler:</strong> 2 | <strong>Methodology:</strong> Predictive

<strong>Scenario:</strong>
A stakeholder asks for a "minor change" to a report layout during a casual hallway conversation. The project manager knows this change will take only two hours of work.

<strong>Question:</strong>
What is the MOST appropriate way to manage this expectation?

- <strong>Correct:</strong> Ask the stakeholder to submit a formal change request or document it yourself and route it through the agreed-upon change control process.
- <strong>Distractor 1:</strong> Do the change immediately as a "favor" to the stakeholder to build "Reciprocity" and improve their engagement.
- <strong>Distractor 2:</strong> Tell the stakeholder that "hallway changes" are strictly forbidden and they should only speak to the PM during formal meetings.
- <strong>Distractor 3:</strong> Tell the team to do the work but don't record the hours spent on it so that the project's CPI isn't affected.

### Question 24

<strong>Enabler:</strong> 3 | <strong>Methodology:</strong> Agile

<strong>Scenario:</strong>
A project manager (Scrum Master) notices that the Product Owner is consistently late to Sprint Reviews and seems distracted during the team's demos.

<strong>Question:</strong>
What is the BEST action for the Scrum Master to take to respond to this behavior?

- <strong>Correct:</strong> Schedule a private 1:1 with the Product Owner to understand if they are feeling overwhelmed or if the project's value is no longer clear to them.
- <strong>Distractor 1:</strong> Publicly call out the Product Owner's lack of commitment during the next Sprint Review to shame them into better behavior.
- <strong>Distractor 2:</strong> Assume the Product Owner is busy with more important things and start making backlog decisions on their behalf.
- <strong>Distractor 3:</strong> Report the Product Owner's behavior to the project sponsor and request that a more "engaged" Product Owner be assigned.

### Question 25

<strong>Enabler:</strong> 1 | <strong>Methodology:</strong> Predictive

<strong>Scenario:</strong>
A project manager is conducting a "WIIFM" analysis for a new project. They identify that the project will significantly reduce the manual workload for the Operations team, but it will also require them to learn a complex new software system.

<strong>Question:</strong>
How should the project manager frame the "WIIFM" message to the Operations team?

- <strong>Correct:</strong> "This project will reduce your manual reporting time by 30% and give you a certification in a market-leading platform, increasing your future career value."
- <strong>Distractor 1:</strong> "This project is mandatory for the company's survival, and you are expected to learn the new software on your own time."
- <strong>Distractor 2:</strong> "The new system is much more advanced than the old one, and you'll be able to do your job much faster than you do now."
- <strong>Distractor 3:</strong> "The executives believe this system is the best choice for the company, so we all need to get on board to ensure it succeeds."

<summary>Detailed Remediation</summary>

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | A good WIIFM message focuses on the *specific benefits* to the stakeholder (time saved, career growth) while acknowledging the change required. |
| **PMI Mindset** | Use "Influence Strategies" like reciprocity and liking. By highlighting the value to *them* (the Ops team), you reduce resistance to the change. |
| **The Trap** | General statements like "do your job faster" are less effective than specific, quantifiable benefits that address their likely fears (learning curve). |

### Question 26

<strong>Enabler:</strong> 2 | <strong>Methodology:</strong> Predictive

<strong>Scenario:</strong>
A project's scope baseline was updated six months ago to include a new regulatory requirement. However, a key stakeholder recently complained that the final deliverable doesn't meet the "intent" of the regulation, despite matching the approved requirements document exactly.

<strong>Question:</strong>
What is the MOST likely cause of this expectation gap?

- <strong>Correct:</strong> The project manager focused on "Requirements Verification" but failed to conduct "Scope Validation" sessions with the stakeholder during development.
- <strong>Distractor 1:</strong> The stakeholder did not read the 200-page requirements document that was sent to them for approval six months ago.
- <strong>Distractor 2:</strong> The project manager did not use a complex enough configuration management system to track the different versions of the regulation.
- <strong>Distractor 3:</strong> The team's development velocity was too low, causing the stakeholder to lose interest in the project's details.

<summary>Detailed Remediation</summary>

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | Verification is about "doing the thing right" (matches spec). Validation is about "doing the right thing" (matches intent). Regular validation prevents late-stage shocks. |
| **PMI Mindset** | Use "Demos and Reviews" as continuous validity checks. Even in predictive, early and frequent validation of intent is superior to late-stage formal sign-off. |
| **The Trap** | Blaming the stakeholder for not reading a long document is a common reactive mistake. The PM's job is to ensure understanding through visualization. |

<strong>Scenario:</strong>
A team's burndown chart shows a "flat line" for five consecutive days during a two-week sprint. Stakeholders who monitor the dashboard are becoming anxious and are starting to ask for daily status meetings.

<strong>Question:</strong>
How should the project manager (Scrum Master) manage these stakeholders' expectations while protecting the team?

- <strong>Correct:</strong> Acknowledge the flat line, explain the specific blocker or "large story" causing the visual plateau, and invite stakeholders to the daily standup as observers.
- <strong>Distractor 1:</strong> Direct the team to update their tasks in the software daily, even if no work was completed, to make the burndown chart look like it's progressing.
- <strong>Distractor 2:</strong> Refuse the daily status meetings and tell the stakeholders that they must wait until the Sprint Review to get any information.
- <strong>Distractor 3:</strong> Cancel the current sprint and re-plan the work into smaller stories to ensure the burndown chart always shows a downward trend.

### Question 28

<strong>Enabler:</strong> 1 | <strong>Methodology:</strong> Hybrid

<strong>Scenario:</strong>
A project manager is working on a hybrid project where the marketing department expects a "big bang" launch event, but the IT department is planning a "phased rollout" to manage technical risk.

<strong>Question:</strong>
What is the FIRST action the project manager should take to align these expectations?

- <strong>Correct:</strong> Facilitate a joint session between Marketing and IT to map out the dependencies and risks of both approaches and reach a compromise "Launch Strategy."
- <strong>Distractor 1:</strong> Side with the IT department as technical risk is more important than marketing visibility in a project's long-term success.
- <strong>Distractor 2:</strong> Side with the Marketing department as they are the primary "customer" of the project's business value.
- <strong>Distractor 3:</strong> Create two separate project plans and let each department follow their own strategy until the final week before launch.

### Question 29

<strong>Enabler:</strong> 2 | <strong>Methodology:</strong> Predictive

<strong>Scenario:</strong>
A project is consistently under budget (CPI = 1.20) but behind schedule (SPI = 0.80). The key stakeholder's primary expectation is to meet a specific market-entry date, regardless of cost.

<strong>Question:</strong>
Based on these expectations, what is the BEST recommendation for the project manager to make?

- <strong>Correct:</strong> Propose a "Crashing" strategy to the sponsor, using the excess budget to add resources to the critical path activities.
- <strong>Distractor 1:</strong> Suggest a "Fast-Tracking" strategy to overlap activities, as it is a lower-cost way to recover the schedule.
- <strong>Distractor 2:</strong> Recommend "Reducing Scope" to ensure the project meets the deadline within the original budget.
- <strong>Distractor 3:</strong> Advise the team to work harder and hope that the schedule performance improves naturally in the next quarter.

<details>
<summary>Detailed Remediation</summary>

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | Crashing adds cost to save time. Since the stakeholder prioritizes the date over cost and there is budget available (CPI > 1.0), crashing is the most aligned choice. |
| **PMI Mindset** | Tailor the recovery action to the stakeholder's priorities. Fast-tracking increases rework risk, which might further delay a critical market-entry date. |
| **The Trap** | Fast-tracking is often the default choice to "save money," but if money isn't the constraint, crashing is usually more effective and less risky for quality. |

### Question 30

<strong>Enabler:</strong> 3 | <strong>Methodology:</strong> Agile

<strong>Scenario:</strong>
During a Sprint Review, a stakeholder provides feedback that a feature is "perfect" but then mentions three other features they now expect because of how well this one works.

<strong>Question:</strong>
How should the project manager (Scrum Master) help the Product Owner manage this situation?

- <strong>Correct:</strong> Ensure the new expectations are captured as new user stories in the product backlog for future refinement and prioritization.
- <strong>Distractor 1:</strong> Advise the Product Owner to add the new features to the current sprint immediately while the stakeholder is still feeling positive.
- <strong>Distractor 2:</strong> Remind the stakeholder that the project scope was fixed at the start and no new features can be added at this stage.
- <strong>Distractor 3:</strong> Ask the development team to estimate the new features during the Sprint Review so a decision can be made on the spot.

<details>
<summary>Detailed Remediation</summary>

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | In Agile, feedback is welcomed and managed through the backlog. Capturing new expectations as stories allows for formal value-based prioritization later. |
| **PMI Mindset** | Demos build trust and "Surface" new expectations. Use the established agile process (backlog refinement) rather than making ad-hoc decisions. |
| **The Trap** | Adding work to the current sprint disrupts the team's commitment and flow; refusing changes violates agile principles. |

### Question 31

<strong>Enabler:</strong> 1 | <strong>Methodology:</strong> Predictive

<strong>Scenario:</strong>
A project manager is taking over a project where the previous PM was fired for "lack of transparency." The stakeholders are skeptical and suspicious of all project data being presented.

<strong>Question:</strong>
According to the Trust Equation, which factor should the new project manager focus on to rebuild the relationship MOST quickly?

- <strong>Correct:</strong> Reliability—by consistently meeting every small commitment made to the stakeholders, no matter how minor.
- <strong>Distractor 1:</strong> Intimacy—by sharing personal stories about their own past failures to show they are "human."
- <strong>Distractor 2:</strong> Credibility—by providing a detailed list of all their professional certifications and academic achievements.

### Question 32

<strong>Enabler:</strong> 2 | <strong>Methodology:</strong> Hybrid

<strong>Scenario:</strong>
A project's steering committee expects a fixed-price contract for a vendor, but the vendor's work is being managed using an agile framework due to high uncertainty in the requirements.

<strong>Question:</strong>
What is the BEST way for the project manager to align these conflicting expectations?

- <strong>Correct:</strong> Propose a "Graduated Fixed Price" or "Fixed Price Incentive" contract that provides cost certainty for the steering committee while allowing for scope flexibility.
- <strong>Distractor 1:</strong> Tell the steering committee that they must use a "Time and Materials" contract because agile doesn't support fixed-price agreements.
- <strong>Distractor 2:</strong> Force the vendor to commit to a fixed-scope backlog, effectively turning the agile process into a "Waterfall" project.

<strong>Scenario:</strong>
An agile team's velocity has dropped by 20% over the last three sprints. The Product Owner is concerned that the "Expectation of Value" for the next release will not be met.

<strong>Question:</strong>
What should the Scrum Master do to monitor and respond to this situation effectively?

- <strong>Correct:</strong> Facilitate a retrospective to identify the root cause of the velocity drop (e.g., technical debt, blockers, or team morale) and communicate the revised forecast to stakeholders.
- <strong>Distractor 1:</strong> Increase the team's velocity targets by 20% in the next sprint to "make up" for the lost productivity.
- <strong>Distractor 2:</strong> Tell the team to stop doing retrospectives and use that time for development work to increase their throughput.
- <strong>Distractor 3:</strong> Tell the Product Owner to "lower their expectations" without providing any data-based reason for the drop in performance.

A project manager is identifying stakeholders for a new global project. They realize that the cultural expectations regarding "authority" and "decision-making" vary significantly between the regions involved.

<strong>Question:</strong>
What tool or technique is BEST for managing these diverse expectations?

- <strong>Correct:</strong> Use a "Stakeholder Engagement Assessment Matrix" and cultural awareness training to tailor engagement strategies for each region.
- <strong>Distractor 1:</strong> Mandate a single, "Global Standard" for communication and decision-making to ensure consistency across the project.
- <strong>Distractor 2:</strong> Only communicate with the regional leads and assume they will manage the expectations of their own local teams.

A project has a "Hard Deadline" due to a regulatory change. The team is using an agile approach for the software but is struggling with the "Definition of Done" for the final compliance check.

<strong>Question:</strong>
How can the project manager align the team's work with the compliance expectation?

- <strong>Correct:</strong> Include a "Compliance Lead" in the backlog refinement sessions and update the "Definition of Done" to include formal regulatory validation.
- <strong>Distractor 1:</strong> Wait until the end of the project to perform a single, massive "Compliance Audit" to avoid slowing down the team's development sprints.
- <strong>Distractor 2:</strong> Ask the development team to read the 500-page compliance manual and sign a document saying they have followed all the rules.

A project's risk register shows a high-probability risk that a key supplier will go bankrupt. The project manager has a "Fallback Plan" to use a more expensive supplier if this happens. The sponsor expects the project to stay on budget.

<strong>Question:</strong>
What is the BEST way to manage the sponsor's expectations regarding this risk?

- <strong>Correct:</strong> Inform the sponsor of the risk and the fallback plan now, explaining the potential impact on the "Management Reserve" or "Contingency" if the risk occurs.
- <strong>Distractor 1:</strong> Wait until the supplier actually goes bankrupt before telling the sponsor anything to avoid causing "unnecessary anxiety."
- <strong>Distractor 2:</strong> Tell the sponsor that the project is "guaranteed" to stay on budget because you have already identified all the risks.

<strong>Question:</strong>
As the Scrum Master, how should you facilitate the management of these conflicting expectations?

- <strong>Correct:</strong> Facilitate a "Spike" or a "Technical Feasibility Workshop" where the team and Marketing can explore options and understand the architectural constraints.
- <strong>Distractor 1:</strong> Side with the Development Team and tell Marketing that their ideas are impossible and should be removed from the backlog.

<strong>Scenario:</strong>
A project manager is creating a "Stakeholder Engagement Plan" for a project with many "Resistant" stakeholders. The project is critical for the organization's long-term sustainability but will result in job losses for several departments.

<strong>Question:</strong>
What is the MOST ethical and effective strategy for managing these stakeholders' expectations?

- <strong>Correct:</strong> Use "Radical Transparency" to communicate the hard truths about job losses, while highlighting the support and "new opportunities" (outplacement, retraining) available to them.

- <strong>Correct:</strong> Perform a "Trend Analysis" to forecast the "Estimate at Completion" (EAC) and initiate a discussion with the sponsor about "Value-Based Scope Prioritization" to stay within budget.
- <strong>Distractor 1:</strong> Wait until the budget is 90% spent before telling the sponsor that the project is running over.
- <strong>Distractor 2:</strong> Ask the team to work 10 hours of unpaid overtime each week to reduce the "Actual Cost" of the labor.
- <strong>Distractor 3:</strong> Suggest that the sponsor uses the "Management Reserve" to cover the cost overrun without needing to change the project's scope.

| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | Proactive monitoring involves using "Trend Analysis" to provide early warning. "No Surprises" means presenting the problem and the "Scope Trade-off" option early. |
| **PMI Mindset** | Use EVM metrics (EAC) to drive decisions. Addressing cost trends before they consume the contingency is the essence of "Control." |
| **The Trap** | Using Management Reserve for a systemic cost overrun is a "band-aid" that doesn't fix the underlying productivity or estimating issue. |

### Question 42

<strong>Enabler:</strong> 3 | <strong>Methodology:</strong> Agile

<strong>Scenario:</strong>
During a Retrospective, the team realizes that several "Supportive" stakeholders have stopped attending the Sprint Reviews.

<strong>Question:</strong>
What should the Scrum Master suggest as the BEST way to respond to this disengagement?

- <strong>Correct:</strong> Reach out to the stakeholders 1:1 to find out if the reviews are no longer valuable to them and look for ways to "Tailor" the demo format.
- <strong>Distractor 1:</strong> Mandate that all stakeholders attend the reviews by marking them "Required" in the calendar invites and BCCing their managers.
- <strong>Distractor 2:</strong> Assume that because the project is going well, the stakeholders don't feel the need to attend, and focus on the team's internal work.
- <strong>Distractor 3:</strong> Stop doing the Sprint Reviews entirely and send a PDF of the "Done" stories to the stakeholders instead.

<details>
<summary>Detailed Remediation</summary>

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | "Signs Engagement is Slipping" (missing demos) should be investigated through "Direct 1:1 check-ins." The PM must find the root cause of the disengagement. |
| **PMI Mindset** | Demos beat status reports. If stakeholders aren't coming, the "Value" or "Format" of the demo likely needs to be improved to meet their expectations. |
| **The Trap** | Forcing attendance or giving up on the ceremony both fail to address the underlying relationship or communication issue. |

### Question 43

<strong>Enabler:</strong> 1 | <strong>Methodology:</strong> Hybrid

<strong>Scenario:</strong>
A project manager is launching a "Sustainability" project. The local community (external stakeholders) expects the project to use 100% renewable energy, but the project charter only specifies "at least 50%."

<strong>Question:</strong>
What is the BEST way to manage this expectation gap?

- <strong>Correct:</strong> Hold a "Town Hall" or "Community Forum" to explain the project's constraints, share the 50% plan, and co-create an "Expansion Roadmap" for the future.
- <strong>Distractor 1:</strong> Ignore the community's expectation as they are not the primary "internal" customers and they don't provide the project's funding.
- <strong>Distractor 2:</strong> Change the project's scope to 100% renewable energy immediately to avoid any "bad press" or community resistance.
- <strong>Distractor 3:</strong> Tell the community that "the project charter is confidential" and they should trust that the company is doing its best.

<details>
<summary>Detailed Remediation</summary>

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | "Surface Expectations" and "Align Early." Engaging external stakeholders in a "Co-Creation" process builds trust and shared ownership, even when constraints differ. |
| **PMI Mindset** | Use "Influence Strategies" like reciprocity and liking. By involving them in the roadmap, you address their "WIIFM" and build a long-term coalition. |
| **The Trap** | Ignoring external stakeholders often leads to "Active Opposition" (lawsuits, protests) that can delay or kill a project. |

### Question 44

<strong>Enabler:</strong> 2 | <strong>Methodology:</strong> Predictive

<strong>Scenario:</strong>
A project manager identifies that two different department heads have a "Conflict of Interest" regarding which software platform the project should use. One department head is a "Resistant" stakeholder, while the other is "Leading."

<strong>Question:</strong>
What is the BEST way to handle this conflict?

- <strong>Correct:</strong> Facilitate a session with both department heads and the project sponsor to evaluate both platforms against the "Project Objectives" and "ROI" criteria.
- <strong>Distractor 1:</strong> Choose the platform favored by the "Leading" stakeholder as they are more supportive of the project's overall success.
- <strong>Distractor 2:</strong> Choose the platform favored by the "Resistant" stakeholder to try and "Convert" them into a supporter.
- <strong>Distractor 3:</strong> Let the two department heads decide for themselves, and if they can't agree, delay the project until they do.

<details>
<summary>Detailed Remediation</summary>

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | "Align Early" involves using objective data (Objectives, ROI) and sponsor involvement for "high-level political alignment" when peers are in conflict. |
| **PMI Mindset** | The PM facilitates the decision process. Escalation to the sponsor is appropriate when strategic alignment or cross-departmental conflict is involved. |
| **The Trap** | Choosing one side arbitrarily based on their "Support" level is biased and ignores the best outcome for the organization. |

### Question 45

<strong>Enabler:</strong> 3 | <strong>Methodology:</strong> Agile

<strong>Scenario:</strong>
An agile team is working on a project with a very high "Defect Escape Rate" from their sprints into the UAT phase. Stakeholders are losing confidence in the team's ability to deliver quality software.

<strong>Question:</strong>
What is the MOST appropriate way to respond to these stakeholders' expectations for quality?

- <strong>Correct:</strong> Update the team's "Definition of Done" to include more rigorous testing and invite stakeholders to a "Quality Deep-Dive" retrospective to show the improvements.
- <strong>Distractor 1:</strong> Tell the stakeholders that "bugs are normal in agile" and they should just be happy with the high velocity of the team.
- <strong>Distractor 2:</strong> Hire a separate "QA Team" to find all the bugs at the end of the project so the development team can stay focused on new features.
- <strong>Distractor 3:</strong> Blame the "UAT Team" for finding too many bugs and suggest that they should be less critical during their testing sessions.

<details>
<summary>Detailed Remediation</summary>

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | A high escape rate is a quality failure. Responding involves "Direct engagement + process adjustment" (DoD). Showing improvements in a retrospective builds credibility. |
| **PMI Mindset** | Use "Root Cause Analysis" (RCA) and "Continuous Improvement." Quality is a core pillar of trust (Reliability). |
| **The Trap** | Dismissing quality concerns as "not agile" or shifting blame destroys the PM's "Credibility" and the team's reputation. |

### Question 46

<strong>Enabler:</strong> 1 | <strong>Methodology:</strong> Predictive

<strong>Scenario:</strong>
During a project's "Closing Phase," a stakeholder mentions that they never received the "Operational Training" they expected to get before the system went live.

<strong>Question:</strong>
Where should the project manager have identified this expectation initially?

- <strong>Correct:</strong> In the "Stakeholder Register" and "Communications Plan," which should have been updated after the initial "Expectation Surfacing" meetings.
- <strong>Distractor 1:</strong> In the "Risk Register," as failing to train people is a significant threat to project success.
- <strong>Distractor 2:</strong> In the "Project Charter," as all high-level expectations must be documented there for the project to be authorized.
- <strong>Distractor 3:</strong> In the "Issue Log," as the lack of training is an active problem that needs a resolution owner.

<details>
<summary>Detailed Remediation</summary>

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | Identifying expectations happens during analysis. The "Stakeholder Register" captures *what* they expect, and the "Communications/Engagement Plan" captures *how* you will meet it. |
| **PMI Mindset** | "No Surprises" at closing. Regular check-ins on "expectation drift" would have caught this missing training expectation much earlier in the project. |
| **The Trap** | While it *becomes* an issue and a risk, the *identification* of the expectation should have happened during the stakeholder analysis/planning phase. |

### Question 47

<strong>Enabler:</strong> 2 | <strong>Methodology:</strong> Hybrid

<strong>Scenario:</strong>
A project's "Scope Baseline" includes 50 features. The "Agile Team" realizes that 10 of these features are "Low Value" and will take 20% of the remaining budget.

<strong>Question:</strong>
How should the project manager manage the stakeholders' expectations regarding these low-value features?

- <strong>Correct:</strong> Facilitate a "Value Discovery" session with stakeholders to show the data on low ROI and propose "Pivot or Defer" options for those features.
- <strong>Distractor 1:</strong> Build the features anyway because they are in the "Scope Baseline" and the stakeholders expect them to be delivered.
- <strong>Distractor 2:</strong> Quietly remove the features from the backlog and use the saved budget to "Gold Plate" the high-value features.
- <strong>Distractor 3:</strong> Tell the team to work faster so they can finish all 50 features within the original budget, even if they are low value.

<details>
<summary>Detailed Remediation</summary>

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | "Align Early" involve comparing expectations (scope) to reality (value/ROI). "No Surprises" means presenting the trade-off decision to stakeholders. |
| **PMI Mindset** | Focus on "Value Delivery." In modern PM, it's better to deliver the right value than to strictly follow a plan that includes waste. |
| **The Trap** | Blindly following a baseline that includes waste is a "Waterfall" trap that ignores the organization's best interest (ROI). |

### Question 48

<strong>Enabler:</strong> 3 | <strong>Methodology:</strong> Agile

<strong>Scenario:</strong>
An agile team's "Cycle Time" is increasing, but their "Velocity" is staying the same because they are starting many new stories but not finishing them.

<strong>Question:</strong>
As the Scrum Master, how should you communicate this trend to stakeholders who are expecting a release in four weeks?

- <strong>Correct:</strong> Use a "Cumulative Flow Diagram" (CFD) to show the widening "In Progress" band and explain that the "Done" date is at risk unless the team limits WIP.
- <strong>Distractor 1:</strong> Show only the "Velocity" chart, as it is still stable and will make the stakeholders feel that the project is on track.
- <strong>Distractor 2:</strong> Tell the team to work overtime to finish all the "In Progress" stories before the next Sprint Review.
- <strong>Distractor 3:</strong> Tell the stakeholders that "Cycle Time is a technical metric" and it doesn't have any impact on the project's final delivery date.

<details>
<summary>Detailed Remediation</summary>

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | "Visual Progress" (CFD) builds confidence. A widening "In Progress" band is a leading indicator of a missed deadline. "Radical Transparency" requires sharing this warning. |
| **PMI Mindset** | Don't use "Vanity Metrics" (stable velocity) to hide "Real Risks" (increasing cycle time/unstable flow). |
| **The Trap** | High velocity with many open stories is "Technical Debt" or "Work in Progress" that has zero value until it's "Done." |

### Question 49

<strong>Enabler:</strong> 1 | <strong>Methodology:</strong> Predictive

<strong>Scenario:</strong>
A project manager is presenting the "Project Success Criteria" to a group of stakeholders. One stakeholder says, "I don't care about the budget; I only care that this system is easy for my team to use."

<strong>Question:</strong>
How should the project manager adjust their "Expectation Management Strategy" for this stakeholder?

- <strong>Correct:</strong> Update the stakeholder register to note their "User Experience" (UX) focus and ensure they are invited to all "Usability Demos" and "UX Design Reviews."
- <strong>Distractor 1:</strong> Remind the stakeholder that "Budget" is one of the three core pillars of the Triple Constraint and they must care about it.
- <strong>Distractor 2:</strong> Categorize this stakeholder as "Unaware" because they don't seem to understand the project's formal success metrics.
- <strong>Distractor 3:</strong> Ignore the stakeholder's comment and continue to send them the "Monthly Financial Variance" reports as planned.

<details>

| Aspect | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Core Logic** | "Tailor Engagement" to what the stakeholder cares about. By involving them in what they value (UX), you build "Intimacy" and a supportive relationship. |
| **PMI Mindset** | Meet stakeholders where they are. Their personal "success criteria" (ease of use) might be more important to their engagement than the PM's "hard metrics." |
| **The Trap** | Forcing stakeholders to care about things they don't care about (e.g., budget) is a "Low Empathy" approach that leads to disengagement. |

### Question 50

<strong>Enabler:</strong> 2 | <strong>Methodology:</strong> Hybrid

<strong>Scenario:</strong>
A project's "Product Vision" was recently changed by the CEO. The "Marketing Team" is excited about the new direction, but the "Operations Team" is resistant, as they were already halfway through training for the old vision.

<strong>Question:</strong>
What is the BEST action for the project manager to take to align these teams' expectations?

- <strong>Correct:</strong> Facilitate a "Pivot Workshop" where the CEO explains the *Strategic Why* behind the change, and the project manager outlines the support available for retraining the Operations team.
- <strong>Distractor 1:</strong> Tell the Operations team that "orders are orders" and they must stop complaining and start learning the new system immediately.
- <strong>Distractor 2:</strong> Side with the Operations team and tell the CEO that the change is "too late" and will cause the project to fail.
- <strong>Distractor 3:</strong> Tell the Marketing team to "keep the change a secret" from the Operations team until the new training materials are 100% complete.

| **Core Logic** | "Align Early" involves explaining the "WIIFM" and the "Strategic Why" from the highest authority (CEO) to reduce resistance and rebuild the coalition. |
| **PMI Mindset** | Use "Radical Transparency" and "Sponsor Support" for political alignment. Address the root cause of resistance (wasted effort/fear) with empathy and a plan. |
| **The Trap** | Hiding a change or being authoritative ("orders are orders") destroyed trust and increases the likelihood of "Active Opposition" or "Silent Withdrawal." |

##  Key Takeaways: Expectations Pro-Tips

1. <strong>Surface Implicit Expectations Early:</strong> Use demos, prototypes, and 1:1 meetings to uncover what stakeholders *think* they want, not just what they wrote in requirements.
2. <strong>The Trust Equation is Your Compass:</strong> If trust is low, focus on **Reliability** (meeting small commitments) and **Intimacy** (creating safe spaces for fears).
3. <strong>No Surprises Rule:</strong> Communicate trends (declining velocity, rising costs, widening CFD bands) as early warning signals, even before they hit a threshold.
4. **Stakeholders are Participants, not Observers:** In Agile and Hybrid, involve stakeholders in the flow (Reviews, DoD workshops) to ensure continuous alignment.
5. <strong>WIIFM is the Key to Resistance:</strong> Address the "What's In It For Me" from the stakeholder's specific perspective to neutralize fear-based opposition.
6. <strong>Analyze Before Acting:</strong> When a gap appears, confirm the data and perform a Root Cause Analysis (RCA) before proposing recovery options or submitting change requests.
