# Chapter 5 – Core Project Management Concepts and Tools

By the end of her first month, Sarah has learned how to choose a way of working (Chapter 4). But she realizes: *Choosing the right approach is only half the battle. I still need to manage scope, schedule, cost, quality, risks, and stakeholders—regardless of whether I am working predictively, agilely, or hybrid.*

This chapter covers the core concepts and tools that underpin all project management, regardless of methodology. These are the fundamentals that appear across the Exam Content Outline and that every practicing project manager must understand.

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:

- Identify and engage stakeholders effectively, understanding their needs, influence, and expectations
- Manage scope, schedule, and cost as integrated constraints that require trade-off decisions
- Apply quality thinking to ensure deliverables meet stakeholder needs
- Identify and manage risks as both threats and opportunities
- Use data and metrics to make informed project decisions
- Understand the emerging role of AI in project management and its ethical implications
- Recognize ethical dilemmas in project work and apply professional responsibility standards

These concepts thread through every project, at every level, in every industry. Understanding them deeply will serve you well on the exam and in your career.

## 5.1 Stakeholders and Stakeholder Engagement: The Foundation of Everything

Sarah quickly learns that the technical side of project management (creating schedules, tracking budgets) is only part of the job. The harder part is understanding *people*: who cares about this project, what do they care about, how much influence do they have, and how do I keep them engaged and aligned?

### 5.1.1 Who Are Stakeholders?

A stakeholder is anyone who has an interest in, is affected by, or can affect the project.

This sounds simple, but it is deceptively broad. Stakeholders include:

- **Project sponsors** – who fund the work and have strategic interest
- **Project team members** – who do the work
- **Business stakeholders** – who use or benefit from the outcome
- **End users** – who ultimately use the deliverable
- **Regulatory bodies** – who enforce compliance
- **Vendors and contractors** – who supply goods or services
- **Community members** – who might be affected by the project's outcomes
- **Competitors** – who might be interested in the project's success or failure
- **Internal support functions** – like HR, IT, Finance, who enable the work
- **Even silent or future stakeholders** – people who are not yet visible but who will care once the project's impact becomes clear

### 5.1.2 Sarah's Stakeholder Challenge: The Office Renovation

In the office renovation project, Sarah initially thinks: *"The key stakeholders are the facilities team, the CFO, and the department heads."*

But in her second week, reality hits. She gets pulled into conversations with:

- **The CEO** – who cares about the move date (it is tied to a press announcement about the company's new direction)
- **IT leaders** – who have very specific requirements about network infrastructure that were not in the original scope discussion
- **Facilities** – who care about ongoing maintenance and energy efficiency
- **Department heads** – who worry about disruption to their teams during the move
- **Individual employees** – who are anxious about their workspace and commute
- **The building contractor** – who has their own timeline and constraints
- **Regulatory inspectors** – who will sign off on compliance
- **Future employees** – who have not been hired yet but will work in this space
- **Landlord of the current space** – who has requirements about how the space must be left

Sarah realizes: *Different stakeholders care about completely different things. The CFO cares about cost. The CEO cares about the launch date. Employees care about their workspace. IT cares about infrastructure. Regulators care about compliance. If I do not understand what each group cares about, I will disappoint someone.*

### 5.1.3 Stakeholder Analysis: Understanding Power and Interest

Sarah learns a framework for thinking about stakeholders systematically: **Power/Interest Grid**

| Power / Interest | High Interest | Low Interest |
|------------------|---------------|-------------|
| **High Power** | **Manage Closely** – These stakeholders have both power and interest. They shape the project significantly. Sarah must communicate frequently, involve them in decisions, and keep them satisfied. | **Keep Satisfied** – These stakeholders have power but low current interest. Sarah must keep them informed and happy so they do not become blockers. They could become Manage Closely if their interest increases. |
| **Low Power** | **Keep Informed** – These stakeholders care deeply but have limited ability to influence outcomes. Sarah should listen to them, acknowledge their concerns, and communicate transparently, but primary decisions rest with higher-power stakeholders. | **Monitor** – These stakeholders have neither high power nor high interest. Sarah monitors them to catch any changes (e.g., an employee who becomes a department head and suddenly has more influence). |

**Sarah's office renovation stakeholder map:**

- **Manage Closely**: CFO, CEO, VP of Facilities, General Contractor
  - These shape the project's scope, budget, timeline, and major decisions
  - Sarah has weekly meetings with them, involves them in decisions, escalates issues quickly

- **Keep Satisfied**: VP of IT, Facilities manager's team, Major department heads
  - They have influence but are not micromanaging
  - Sarah briefs them monthly, incorporates their feedback, keeps them in the loop

- **Keep Informed**: Individual employees, Regulatory inspectors (before sign-off)
  - They care but are not decision-makers
  - Sarah sends periodic updates, holds open forums, listens to concerns

- **Monitor**: Current landlord, Competitors, Future employees
  - Low power and interest currently, but Sarah watches for changes

### 5.1.4 Stakeholder Engagement: Beyond Just Informing

Sarah learns that *stakeholder engagement is not the same as stakeholder communication*. Communication is one-way: you tell them something. Engagement is two-way: you involve them, listen to them, respond to them.

For **Manage Closely** stakeholders:

- Involve them in planning and decision-making
- Seek their input before finalizing major decisions
- Address their concerns directly and promptly
- Provide them with transparency and honesty about risks and issues
- Example: Sarah holds a planning workshop with the CFO and CEO to discuss the scope and confirm the budget before moving forward with contractor bids

For **Keep Satisfied** stakeholders:

- Provide regular updates (monthly, in this case)
- Solicit feedback and acknowledge it
- Involve them in decisions that affect them directly
- Manage expectations about what can and cannot be accommodated
- Example: Sarah presents the IT infrastructure plan to the VP of IT, asks for feedback, and incorporates their input

For **Keep Informed** stakeholders:

- Provide clear, accessible communication
- Listen to their concerns and acknowledge them
- Explain how their feedback is being addressed (or why it cannot be)
- Create forums where they can ask questions
- Example: Sarah holds a town hall for employees, explains the move timeline, shows photos of the new office, and answers questions about their workspaces

For **Monitor** stakeholders:

- Track their level of interest and influence
- Re-classify them if circumstances change
- Provide basic information in case they become more involved
- Example: Sarah watches the current landlord's communications about the lease exit; if they raise concerns, Sarah escalates

### 5.1.5 Stakeholder Expectations: The Hidden Problem

Sarah encounters a subtle but critical issue midway through the office project: *Different stakeholders have different expectations about what success looks like.*

- **CEO**: Success = move-in on the announced date
- **CFO**: Success = stay within budget
- **Department heads**: Success = their team has good workspaces and minimal disruption
- **Employees**: Success = a modern, comfortable office with good parking and food options
- **Contractor**: Success = clear specifications, timely payments, minimal change orders

If Sarah does not actively manage these expectations, she ends up disappointing people. For example:

- If the CEO prioritizes the date and Sarah spends an extra $500K to hit it, the CFO is unhappy
- If the CFO prioritizes budget and Sarah cuts corners on quality, employees are unhappy
- If Sarah promises employees private offices but the budget only allows open space, everyone is unhappy

Sarah learns: **You must surface and align expectations early.** This means:

1. **Ask** what success looks like for each group
2. **Identify conflicts** where expectations are incompatible
3. **Facilitate trade-off discussions** where stakeholders understand what they are choosing
4. **Document agreements** so expectations are clear and shared
5. **Communicate transparently** when circumstances change (e.g., "We can either move in on time or stay under budget, but not both; which matters more?")

### 5.1.6 Stakeholder Engagement in Different Ways of Working

Sarah realizes that stakeholder engagement looks different depending on the approach:

**In Predictive Contexts (Office Renovation):**

- Stakeholders are involved heavily upfront in scope definition and planning
- Major decisions go through a governance process (change control board)
- Communication is formal: status reports, milestone reviews, structured escalation
- Surprise and change are minimized through clear planning and change control
- Stakeholder satisfaction is measured against the baseline: Did you hit the deadline? Stay in budget?

**In Agile Contexts (Expense System):**

- The product owner is a key stakeholder who is involved continuously
- Other stakeholders (users, sponsors) provide frequent feedback through demos and reviews
- Communication is informal and continuous: daily stand-ups, sprint demos, retrospectives
- Change and learning are expected; the question is whether you are learning fast enough
- Stakeholder satisfaction is measured by whether the deliverables actually solve their problems

**In Hybrid Contexts (Transformation Program):**

- Steering committee stakeholders are involved at phase gates; they see a roadmap
- Team-level stakeholders (users, process owners) are involved in sprints and pilots
- Communication has two channels: formal program reports for executives, informal sprints for teams
- The challenge is ensuring that top-level and team-level stakeholders are aligned
- Sarah must translate between the languages: "What we learned in the pilot affects the program roadmap"

### 5.1.7 Common Stakeholder Engagement Mistakes

Sarah observes several mistakes that other project managers make:

**Mistake 1: Assuming you know what stakeholders care about**

- **The problem**: You guess at stakeholder priorities instead of asking
- **The consequence**: You optimize for the wrong things, disappoint stakeholders, and face unexpected resistance
- **Sarah's example**: A colleague assumes the CEO only cares about cost. But the CEO actually cares more about the move date (for brand positioning). The colleague cuts quality to save money, the CEO is unhappy
- **The fix**: Ask stakeholders directly: "What does success look like for you?"

**Mistake 2: Treating all stakeholders the same**

- **The problem**: You communicate equally to everyone, confusing those who need detail with those who need summaries
- **The consequence**: High-power stakeholders feel micromanaged; low-power stakeholders feel ignored
- **Sarah's example**: She tries to send the same detailed status report to everyone. The CEO does not have time for 20-page reports; the contractor needs those details
- **The fix**: Tailor communication to each stakeholder's needs and power/interest

**Mistake 3: Engaging too late**

- **The problem**: You make decisions, then tell stakeholders instead of involving them
- **The consequence**: Stakeholders feel they were not heard, they push back, decisions get reversed, timelines slip
- **Sarah's example**: The facilities team finalizes the layout without involving department heads. Department heads hate it, demand changes, timeline slips
- **The fix**: Engage early and often, especially with high-power stakeholders

**Mistake 4: Not addressing conflicts between stakeholder expectations**

- **The problem**: Different stakeholders want incompatible things, and you try to satisfy everyone
- **The consequence**: You make trade-offs invisibly, some stakeholders feel blindsided, project fails
- **Sarah's example**: She promises the CEO the move will be on time, promises the CFO to stay under budget, but these are incompatible. When she has to choose, someone is upset
- **The fix**: Surface conflicts, facilitate discussions where stakeholders choose trade-offs, document the decisions

**Mistake 5: Assuming engagement is a one-time event**

- **The problem**: You engage stakeholders at the start, then assume they stay aligned throughout the project
- **The consequence**: Priorities shift, new people join the project, circumstances change—and you have not updated stakeholder expectations
- **Sarah's example**: In month 1, she meets with the CFO about the budget. In month 6, company revenue drops, the CFO's priorities change—but Sarah is still operating on month 1 assumptions
- **The fix**: Engagement is continuous. Re-baseline expectations when circumstances change

### 5.1.8 On the Exam: Stakeholder Engagement Scenarios

Exam questions test stakeholder engagement by presenting a scenario with stakeholder conflict or misalignment, and asking you to choose the best response.

**Common question patterns:**

- *"A key stakeholder is unhappy with the team's direction. What should you do?"*
- *"Two stakeholders have conflicting priorities. How should you handle this?"*
- *"A stakeholder just raised a concern that was not surfaced before. How do you proceed?"*

**Red flag answers:**

- Ignore the stakeholder or dismiss their concern
- Promise that both stakeholders will get what they want without discussing trade-offs
- Make decisions without involving stakeholders
- Assume the stakeholder's needs without asking

**Good answers:**

- Engage the stakeholder directly and understand their concern
- Identify the root cause (misaligned expectations, conflicting priorities, missing information)
- Facilitate a discussion with all affected stakeholders
- Help stakeholders understand trade-offs and make informed decisions
- Document decisions and communicate them clearly
- Adjust the project plan if necessary
- Follow up to confirm the stakeholder's satisfaction
