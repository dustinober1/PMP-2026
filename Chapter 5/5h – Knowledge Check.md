### 5.h.1 Scenario-Based Questions

1. **Stakeholder and Scope Challenge:**

You are managing a transformation project with a firm 12-month deadline. You have identified three key stakeholders: (1) the CFO, who cares most about cost control; (2) the CTO, who cares most about technical quality; (3) the business unit heads, who care most about adoption and minimizing disruption. Early in the project, you realize that all three objectives cannot be fully met: better quality takes more time and money; lower costs might mean less training and support, which hurts adoption.

What should you do?

A) Assure all stakeholders that you will meet all their objectives; you just need to work harder
B) Choose the CFO's objective (cost control) as the priority; the others are secondary
C) Facilitate a discussion with all three stakeholders to agree on trade-offs and priorities
D) Make the trade-off decisions yourself and inform stakeholders after the fact

**Expected answer: C**

Explanation: Stakeholder management is about engaging stakeholders, understanding their priorities, and making conscious trade-off decisions together. Option C is the only one that does this. Option A is unrealistic. Option B arbitrarily prioritizes one stakeholder. Option D makes decisions without engagement.

2. **Schedule and Cost Trade-off:**

Your office renovation project is now in Month 15 of an 18-month timeline. The foundation and structural work is complete, but MEP (mechanical, electrical, plumbing) systems are behind schedule due to supply chain delays. The critical path shows that if MEP slips another 2 weeks, the entire project will miss the 18-month move-in date.

The sponsor calls and says: "How much would it cost to accelerate MEP and hit the deadline?"

You estimate that accelerating MEP by 2 weeks would cost an additional $200K (overtime, expedited shipping, bringing in another contractor).

The original MEP budget was $800K. The total project budget is $4.2M.

What is your recommendation?

A) "The cost is acceptable. Let's accelerate and hit the deadline."
B) "The cost is too high. We should slip the deadline by 2 weeks and accept the delay."
C) "I need more information. Let me analyze the options with you."
D) "Let's reduce scope elsewhere to pay for the acceleration."

**Expected answer: C**

Explanation: This is a trade-off decision that requires understanding the business impact. Option C is correct because it includes investigation. You should ask: (1) How critical is the 18-month date to the business? (2) What is the cost of a 2-week delay? (3) Are there other options? (4) What are the risks of acceleration?

If the CEO's press announcement is tied to Month 18, the delay could be costly (lost marketing opportunity, brand damage). In that case, $200K might be acceptable. If the deadline is flexible, the delay might be preferable.

3. **Quality vs. Schedule:**

You are managing the expense system project. You are in Sprint 5. The sprint goal is to deliver the mobile-responsive expense submission feature. The sprint ends Friday.

On Wednesday, the QA team discovers a bug in the mobile feature: on certain devices, the submit button is not clickable. The QA team estimates fixing this will take 1 day, pushing the feature to next sprint.

The product owner is anxious: "Users are waiting for this feature. Can we release it without fixing this bug?"

What should you do?

A) Release the feature with the bug. Users probably won't encounter it.
B) Fix the bug, even if it means pushing the feature to next sprint.
C) Ask the product owner to make the trade-off decision: Quality or speed?
D) Compromise: Spend a few hours trying to fix the bug, and release if you make progress.

**Expected answer: C (or B, depending on severity)**

Explanation: This is a quality trade-off that requires explicit decision-making. Option C is best because it involves the product owner. If the submit button is not clickable, that is a critical bug (feature does not work). Option B is appropriate.

If the bug is minor (tooltip does not display on one device type), Option C with the decision to release might be acceptable.

The key: Do not hide the bug or release silently knowing it is broken. Make the trade-off explicit and let the product owner decide, understanding the consequences.

4. **Risk Management:**

You are managing the transformation program. In a pilot sprint, a team discovers that the new collaborative meeting format (which the program is trying to roll out) actually reduces team productivity. The team is less efficient with the new format than the old one.

This is a significant finding because the program has committed to rolling out this new format company-wide in Phase 3 (in 6 months).

What should you do?

A) Ignore the pilot finding. One team's experience does not represent everyone. Proceed with Phase 3 rollout.
B) Cancel the transformation program. The new format does not work.
C) Escalate to the program steering committee with the finding. Explore options.
D) Ask the pilot team to try harder with the new format. Maybe they just need practice.

**Expected answer: C**

Explanation: This is a risk that has materialized (the practice does not work as hoped). The appropriate response is to escalate and explore options. Option C is correct. The steering committee should decide: Do we modify the practice? Do we pilot with different teams? Do we adjust the Phase 3 rollout plan?

Options A and D ignore the evidence. Option B is too drastic (there might be other pilots that work).

5. **Data-Informed Decision:**

Your project is halfway through its planned duration. You pull metrics:

- Schedule: CPI = 0.95 (95% of value delivered per dollar spent), SPI = 0.90 (90% of schedule complete for 50% of time elapsed)
- Quality: Defect rate is 2 defects per 100 story points (higher than your target of 0.5)
- Team: Velocity is 8 story points per sprint (stable), but team morale scores dropped from 7.5 to 5.0 on a 10-point scale

What do these metrics signal, and what should you do?

A) Everything looks fine. We are on track. Continue as is.
B) The project is ahead of schedule (CPI is above 1.0), so we can relax.
C) Multiple signals indicate problems: Behind schedule (SPI), quality issues (high defect rate), team stress (low morale). Investigate and take action.
D) The metrics are contradictory. Ignore them and rely on intuition.

**Expected answer: C**

Explanation: Option C correctly interprets the data:

- SPI = 0.90 means we are at 50% progress at 55% of time elapsed. We are behind schedule.
- CPI = 0.95 means we are spending slightly more than planned per unit of value. Costs are okay but not great.
- High defect rate signals quality is suffering.
- Low morale signals team stress and burnout risk.

Together, these point to a problem: The project is behind, quality is not meeting standards, and the team is stressed. You should investigate root causes and take action (e.g., remove blockers, adjust scope, add support, address burnout).

Options A and B miss the signals. Option D ignores data.

6. **Ethics:**

You are managing a project with a tight timeline. A team member is working long hours (60+ per week) to try to meet the schedule. You notice they look exhausted and have made several mistakes.

The sponsor calls: "How is the team doing? Are we going to hit the deadline?"

What should you do?

A) Tell the sponsor everything is fine and the deadline will be met. Do not mention the team member's stress.
B) Tell the sponsor we are on track to meet the deadline because the team is working hard. Ask the sponsor to push the deadline back anyway.
C) Tell the sponsor: "We are pushing hard to meet the deadline, but I am concerned about team burnout. At this pace, we risk quality issues and staff turnover. Let me show you options: (1) Extend the deadline. (2) Reduce scope. (3) Add resources. Each has trade-offs."
D) Quietly cut the team member's hours without involving the sponsor or the team.

**Expected answer: C**

Explanation: This is an ethics question testing professional responsibility and honesty. Option C is correct because it:

1. Is honest about the situation (the team is stressed)
2. Raises the concern (burnout risk)
3. Explains the consequences (quality issues, turnover)
4. Offers options with trade-offs
5. Lets the sponsor make an informed decision

Options A and B are dishonest. Option D is paternalistic and does not address the real problem.

7. **Integration Challenge:**

You are managing a complex project with multiple stakeholder groups:

- Executive sponsor: Wants the project to deliver significant cost savings (30% reduction in operating costs)
- Department heads: Want minimal disruption to their operations during the transition
- Employees: Want to keep their jobs and are worried about layoffs
- Regulatory body: Requires the company to maintain service levels during the transition
- Finance team: Wants to spend as little as possible to achieve the savings

You discover a conflict: To achieve the 30% cost savings, you will likely need to reduce headcount. But the employees are worried about layoffs, and the regulatory body requires you to maintain service levels (which means you cannot eliminate positions without a plan).

How do you navigate this?

A) Recommend the sponsor proceed with layoffs to achieve the savings. That is what they want.
B) Recommend not doing the project because it will harm employees.
C) Initiate a discussion with all stakeholders to understand the real business problem and explore options.
D) Recommend the project but hide the layoff implications from employees until the decision is final.

**Expected answer: C**

Explanation: This is an integration question testing stakeholder management, ethical responsibility, and scope clarity.

Option C is correct because it:

1. Acknowledges the conflict (cost savings vs. job security vs. service levels)
2. Engages stakeholders (do not decide in a vacuum)
3. Explores options (maybe there are ways to achieve savings without layoffs; maybe the stakeholders prioritize differently than assumed)
4. Acts ethically (do not hide information or blindside people)

Options A, B, and D all fail to address the real conflict and engage stakeholders appropriately.

## 5.h.8 Summary

Chapter 5 covered the core project management concepts and tools that underpin all project work:

- **Stakeholders**: Identify who cares about the project. Understand their needs, influence, and expectations. Engage them appropriately.
- **Scope, schedule, cost**: Understand the triple constraint and how trade-offs work. Make conscious decisions about priorities.
- **Quality**: Define what good looks like. Ensure deliverables meet both requirements and user needs. Balance quality with other constraints.
- **Risk**: Identify threats and opportunities. Assess probability and impact. Develop response strategies. Monitor continuously.
- **Data and metrics**: Use data to inform decisions, combined with judgment and context. Look for trends, not single data points.
- **AI and emerging tech**: Understand how AI affects project management. Manage AI projects with experimentation and learning in mind. Address ethics and bias.
- **Ethics and professional responsibility**: Act with integrity. Engage stakeholders. Make conscious trade-offs. Speak up when something is wrong.

In the next chapter, we will move into Part 3 and dive into the People Domain: how to build and lead teams, engage stakeholders, manage conflict, and develop others.
