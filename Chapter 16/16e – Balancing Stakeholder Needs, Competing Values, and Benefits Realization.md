## Introduction

Four months into the transformation program, Sarah convened a stakeholder alignment meeting that revealed a fundamental challenge: **Different stakeholders wanted fundamentally different things.**

The CFO wanted ROI: "Invest in what shows financial return. Cut costs elsewhere."

The Chief People Officer wanted culture and engagement: "This transformation is a chance to build a more inclusive, engaged organization. Don't sacrifice culture for speed."

The Chief Customer Officer wanted speed: "We're losing market share. Fast execution matters more than perfect implementation."

The CIO wanted technical excellence: "We rush this implementation, we'll spend the next 5 years fixing technical debt. Let's build it right."

The Facilities Director wanted sustainability: "Climate change is real. We should make environmental impact a consideration."

And Sarah (as program manager) wanted: Benefits realization, sustainable delivery, stakeholder alignment, and successful organizational change.

These weren't contradictory perspectives born of miscommunication. They were **legitimate competing values** that reflected different parts of the organization's mission and different stakeholder responsibilities.

This section teaches you how to navigate this reality: how to acknowledge competing values, facilitate explicit conversations about trade-offs, and make decisions that are transparent and have stakeholder consent—even when not everyone gets exactly what they want.

## How Different Stakeholders Define Value

The same project can create very different kinds of value for different stakeholders:

### Stakeholder Value Perspectives

**CFO / Finance Leadership**
- Primary measure: Financial ROI, cost savings, revenue generation
- Trade-off: Willing to extend timeline for better financial return
- Risk: Cost-cutting that creates long-term value loss
- Question they ask: "What's the annual financial benefit? How long is payback period?"

**Chief People Officer / HR Leadership**
- Primary measure: Employee engagement, capability building, culture reinforcement
- Trade-off: Willing to invest in change management and capability development; resists burning out teams
- Risk: Culture damage from rushed implementation or unsustainable pace
- Question they ask: "How does this impact our team? Are we building capability? Is this sustainable?"

**Customer-facing Leaders (COO, Chief Customer Officer)**
- Primary measure: Customer impact, market responsiveness, time-to-value
- Trade-off: Willing to prioritize speed; may push for MVP approach
- Risk: Incomplete solutions that disappoint customers or create rework
- Question they ask: "When will customers see value? How fast are we moving?"

**Technical Leaders (CIO, Chief Architect)**
- Primary measure: Technical quality, scalability, sustainability of architecture
- Trade-off: Willing to extend timeline for clean architecture; resists quick fixes that create debt
- Risk: Perfectionism that delays delivery indefinitely
- Question they ask: "Will this architecture support us for 5+ years? What's our technical debt?"

**Operations Leadership**
- Primary measure: Operational efficiency, reliability, maintainability
- Trade-off: Willing to invest in quality and sustainability; resists systems that create high maintenance burden
- Risk: Systems optimized for handoff and efficiency but missing business value
- Question they ask: "Can we operate this reliably? What's the ongoing cost?"

**Sustainability / ESG Leaders**
- Primary measure: Environmental impact, social responsibility, governance integrity
- Trade-off: Willing to invest in responsible practices; resists ignoring long-term impact
- Risk: Sustainability seen as "nice-to-have" and cut under cost pressure
- Question they ask: "What's the environmental/social/governance impact? Is this sustainable?"

**Front-Line Employees / End Users**
- Primary measure: How the change affects their work, workload, capability, job security
- Trade-off: Willing to adopt change if it makes work easier or more meaningful; resistant if it creates extra burden
- Risk: Adoption failure if change is poorly designed for actual work
- Question they ask: "How does this change my work? Will it make things better for me?"

**Executive Sponsor / CEO**
- Primary measure: Strategic impact, competitive advantage, organizational effectiveness
- Trade-off: Willing to trade off some short-term financial return for strategic positioning
- Risk: Unclear priority leads to misalignment across stakeholders
- Question they ask: "Does this advance our strategic direction? What's the competitive impact?"

## The Value Perspectives Matrix

A useful way to map this complexity:

| **Stakeholder** | **Primary Value Driver** | **Willingness to Invest** | **Risk** | **Common Trade-Off** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **CFO** | Financial ROI, cost savings | Low (cost-conscious) | Cuts corners, creates long-term costs | "Reduce scope, reduce cost" |
| **CPO** | Culture, engagement, capability | High (value-driven) | Over-invests in non-essential change management | "Extend timeline for culture building" |
| **CIO** | Technical quality, architecture | Medium (quality-conscious) | Perfectionism delays delivery | "Extend timeline for architecture quality" |
| **COO** | Operational efficiency, reliability | Medium (quality/cost balanced) | Systems that work but are expensive to maintain | "Optimize for operational cost" |
| **Customers** | Speed to value, solution quality | High (when aligned) | May accept reduced quality for speed; later regret | "Fast MVP vs. complete solution" |
| **Front-line Teams** | Job impact, ease of use, job security | Medium (depends on change) | Adoption failure if poorly designed for actual work | "User-friendly design vs. feature completeness" |
| **ESG** | Sustainability, responsibility, governance | Low initially, high once prioritized | Often deferred; creates long-term cost when issues emerge | "Sustainable practices vs. short-term cost" |

## The Competing Values Conversation Framework

When different stakeholders have different value priorities, don't hide it. Instead, use this framework:

### Step 1: Surface the Competing Values Explicitly

**What to say**:
"We have different stakeholders with different legitimate value priorities. Let's name them explicitly:
- Finance wants to minimize cost and maximize ROI
- People leadership wants to build culture and capability sustainably
- Product leadership wants speed to market and customer impact
- Technical leadership wants a scalable, maintainable architecture

These aren't conflicts to hide. They're trade-offs we need to navigate consciously."

**Why**: Naming competing values makes them discussable. Hiding them creates resentment and misalignment.

### Step 2: Understand the Rationale

**What to do**: Ask each stakeholder group to explain why their value priority matters:

**Finance**: "Our organization has limited capital. Every dollar invested here is a dollar not invested elsewhere. We need projects that deliver measurable financial return so we can justify investment to the board."

**People**: "Burned-out teams quit. Culture damage from rushed change takes years to recover from. We've learned (painfully) that sustainable pace and genuine change management are not optional—they're investments in organizational capability."

**Product**: "We're losing market share. Competitors move faster than we do. We need to demonstrate value to customers quickly or we risk irrelevance. Market responsiveness matters."

**Technical**: "Last transformation, we took shortcuts on architecture. Now we're paying for it—every feature takes 30% longer because of technical debt. Let's not repeat that mistake."

**Why**: When people understand the rationale, they become more sympathetic to the other perspective, even if they don't agree.

### Step 3: Identify What's Non-Negotiable

**What to ask**: "For your value priority, what's non-negotiable? What could you compromise on?"

**Example answers**:

**Finance**:
- Non-negotiable: "Project must deliver positive ROI within 18 months"
- Negotiable: "How we achieve that (scope, timeline, approach)"

**People**:
- Non-negotiable: "We cannot work more than 50-hour weeks on average"
- Negotiable: "Some weeks busier than others; acceptable if overall sustainable"

**Product**:
- Non-negotiable: "We need initial value delivery within 6 months"
- Negotiable: "MVP with phased enhancement acceptable if roadmap is clear"

**Technical**:
- Non-negotiable: "Architecture must support 5+ year lifecycle; no quick fixes that create rework"
- Negotiable: "We can do phased refactoring if foundation is solid"

**Why**: Understanding what's truly non-negotiable vs. negotiable narrows the conversation.

### Step 4: Explore Integration Opportunities

**What to ask**: "Are there solutions that satisfy multiple value priorities?"

**Examples**:

**Scenario**: Finance wants cost reduction; People wants sustainable pace
- **Integration**: "Sustainable pace often improves quality, which reduces rework and cost. Short-term investment in sustainability practices pays back in lower long-term costs."

**Scenario**: Product wants speed; Technical wants quality
- **Integration**: "MVP approach + solid architecture foundation satisfies both: Fast to market with core features (speed), built on clean architecture (quality). Phases 2+ add features without technical rework (quality continues)."

**Scenario**: Finance wants cost reduction; ESG wants sustainability
- **Integration**: "Sustainable practices (energy efficiency, responsible sourcing, diversity) have upfront cost but long-term savings and risk mitigation. Total cost of ownership favors sustainability."

**When there's true integration**: Everyone wins. Celebrate it.

### Step 5: Make Value-Based Trade-Offs Explicitly

**When integration isn't possible**, you must acknowledge the trade-off. Use this format:

"We have competing value priorities that can't both be fully satisfied. Here are the options:

**Option A: Prioritize Speed**
- Benefit: Faster time-to-market; revenue impact sooner
- Cost: Reduced architecture quality; 15% higher maintenance cost long-term; 12-month timeline for full technical remediation
- Stakeholder impact: Product leadership happy; Finance happy (fast ROI); Technical leadership concerned; People concerned (likely overtime)

**Option B: Prioritize Quality**
- Benefit: Solid architecture; lower long-term maintenance; sustainable pace
- Cost: 4-month extended timeline; delayed revenue; 12% higher development cost upfront
- Stakeholder impact: Technical leadership happy; People leadership happy; Finance concerned (delayed ROI); Product leadership concerned (competitive pressure)

**Option C: Hybrid (MVP + Phased)**
- Benefit: Fast core delivery; solid foundation; phased feature delivery
- Cost: Requires discipline to maintain architecture quality during MVP; phased delivery requires clear roadmap and stakeholder patience
- Stakeholder impact: Everyone somewhat satisfied; requires governance to maintain quality discipline

Which trade-off do we accept?"

### Step 6: Ensure Informed Consent

**What to do**:
- Make sure stakeholders understand the choice they're making and the consequences
- Get explicit approval from key stakeholders
- Document the decision and rationale
- Track actual consequences vs. predicted consequences

**Document format**:
```
DECISION: We are prioritizing [X value priority]

TRADE-OFF: This means accepting [Y consequence] rather than [Z consequence]

STAKEHOLDER IMPACT:
- Finance: [Impact]
- People: [Impact]
- Technical: [Impact]
- Product: [Impact]

RATIONALE: We made this choice because [business rationale]

APPROVAL:
- CFO: [Signed]
- CPO: [Signed]
- CIO: [Signed]
- Program Lead: [Signed]

CONTINGENCY: If [condition changes], we will revisit this decision
```

**Why**: Documented, informed decisions prevent later claims of "We didn't understand the trade-off" or "Things have changed."

## Common Value Trade-Offs and How to Navigate Them

### Trade-Off 1: Speed vs. Quality

**The tension**: "We're behind schedule. Should we reduce quality testing to catch up?"

**What's really being asked**: "Is delivering something soon better than delivering something solid later?"

**Navigation**:
1. Separate testing types: UAT (user acceptance) is non-negotiable; performance/stress testing might be deferred
2. Offer alternatives: "Rather than reduce testing, we reduce scope and deliver core features with full quality"
3. Calculate risk: "Reducing testing saves 2 weeks but creates 30% defect risk. Likely rework adds 4-6 weeks of remediation. Is 2-week save worth 4-6 week rework risk?"
4. Decide as organization: "Given this analysis, should we extend timeline, reduce scope, or accept defect risk?"

**Sarah's example**: Expense system testing phase had 2 weeks of integration testing. Finance said: "Skip it; launch after 1 week." Sarah's response: "Integration testing is where we catch the bugs that cause post-launch failures. Skipping it saves 1 week but creates 20% risk of launch issues. The cost of production defects ($X) exceeds the value of 1-week savings. Let's find 1 week elsewhere (reduce non-critical features)."

### Trade-Off 2: Speed vs. Change Management

**The tension**: "Change management is taking 6 weeks. We're behind schedule. Can we defer it?"

**What's really being asked**: "Is getting the solution fast more important than ensuring people adopt it?"

**Navigation**:
1. Quantify benefit impact: "Deferring change management reduces adoption from 85% to 60%, which reduces cost savings benefit from $250K to $150K (shortfall: $100K)"
2. Calculate timeline impact: "We save 6 weeks now, but low adoption means benefits realization takes 18 months (vs. 9 months). Real timeline impact: 0 weeks saved (actually added time to get to benefits)"
3. Offer alternatives: "Core change management (3 weeks) is prerequisite; optional capability-building workshops (3 weeks) can be deferred. This saves 3 weeks while protecting adoption"
4. Decide: "Given that core change management is prerequisite to benefits, should we include it or accept lower benefits realization?"

**Sarah's example**: Transformation program wanted to skip 6-week change management. Sarah quantified: "Core change management (weeks 1-3) is prerequisite to adoption. Deferring weeks 4-6 (capability-building) saves 3 weeks. But deferring weeks 1-3 costs $375K in benefits shortfall over 3 years. Recommend we include weeks 1-3, defer weeks 4-6 if needed."

### Trade-Off 3: Cost vs. Sustainability

**The tension**: "Sustainable practices cost more. We're over budget. Should we cut them?"

**What's really being asked**: "Is upfront cost savings worth long-term impact?"

**Navigation**:
1. Calculate lifecycle cost: "Sustainable HVAC costs $X more upfront, but saves $50K/year in operations. 30-year payback: $X initial cost - ($50K × 30 years) = net benefit of $1.5M"
2. Include risk: "Non-sustainable choice creates regulatory risk (carbon tax, environmental regulation) worth $Y. Sustainable choice avoids this risk"
3. Include reputation: "Sustainability commitment attracts conscious consumers (estimated $Z value) and talent"
4. Decide: "Given lifecycle cost, should we invest in sustainability?"

**Sarah's example**: Office renovation wanted to cut $75K in sustainability features. Sarah's analysis: "Cutting features saves $75K upfront, costs $50K/year in higher energy costs (×30 years = $1.5M), plus regulatory risk and reputation value. Total long-term cost of cutting: $1.3M+. Recommend keeping sustainable features."

### Trade-Off 4: Responsiveness vs. Governance

**The tension**: "We're agile. Do we really need formal change control?" vs. "We're traditional. How much flexibility can we allow?"

**What's really being asked**: "How much do we optimize for speed vs. control?"

**Navigation**:
1. Acknowledge both values: "Responsiveness to changing needs matters. So does governance and avoiding chaos."
2. Find the balanced approach: "Agile with lightweight governance; or formal approach with escalation paths that allow rapid decisions"
3. Define decision authorities: "Who can approve scope changes under $X? Who approves over $X? How fast?"
4. Decide: "What governance provides control without killing responsiveness?"

**Sarah's example**: Hybrid program needed governance that balanced agile team autonomy with program-level value protection. Solution: "Workstreams have autonomy on approach and minor scope changes (<$50K impact). Changes over $50K or with program-level impact require program governance approval (48-hour turnaround). This gives teams flexibility while protecting program-level value."

## Governance Models for Balancing Competing Values

Different governance structures handle value conflicts differently:

### Model 1: Steering Committee with Diverse Membership

**Members**: CFO, CPO, CIO, COO, Product Lead, Program Manager

**Approach**:
- Regular meetings (bi-weekly) to surface value conflicts
- Explicit discussion: "Finance wants cost control; People wants capability building. How do we balance?"
- Decision authority: Steering committee has explicit authority to make trade-off decisions

**Advantage**: Multiple perspectives represented; balance emerges naturally from diverse input

**Risk**: Slow decisions; committee may become politicized

**When it works**: Projects with competing value priorities where executive alignment is critical

### Model 2: Sponsor Authority with Stakeholder Council

**Structure**: Single sponsor (e.g., COO) with authority to make value trade-offs; stakeholder council (representatives from Finance, People, Tech, Product) provides input

**Approach**:
- Stakeholder council identifies competing values and recommends options
- Sponsor makes final decision, informed by council input
- Clearer authority; faster decisions

**Advantage**: Clear decision authority; stakeholder input without decision paralysis

**Risk**: Sponsor may overweight their own priority; other stakeholders may feel unheard

**When it works**: Sponsor has credibility across constituencies; strong communication about decision-making

### Model 3: Majority Rule with Minority Protection

**Structure**: Voting committee with rules protecting minority concerns

**Approach**:
- Competing value options go to vote
- Majority decides, but minority concerns must be documented and acknowledged
- Contingency: "If financial projections change (minority concern), we revisit"

**Advantage**: Democratic; forces explicit consideration of all perspectives

**Risk**: Voting can feel political; losers may not buy in

**When it works**: Organizational culture values open debate and explicit trade-offs

### Model 4: Executive Team Alignment (Best Practice)

**Structure**: Executive leaders (Finance, People, Tech, Product, Ops) pre-align on value priorities before decisions arise

**Approach**:
- Executive team agrees: "In this organization, what are our value priorities? How do we balance them?"
- Example: "Quality is non-negotiable. Speed matters but not at the cost of quality. Sustainability is important. We invest in both."
- Program manager brings decisions against this pre-agreed framework; decisions are faster because framework is set

**Advantage**: Fast decisions; clear organizational values; alignment across stakeholders

**Risk**: Pre-alignment requires executive team maturity and time investment

**When it works**: Organizations with strong leadership alignment and clear values

## How Different Delivery Approaches Handle Value Conflicts

### Predictive

**Challenge**: Multiple stakeholders want different things; formal governance required

**Approach**:
- Steering committee approach; regular governance meetings
- Value conflicts raised during planning; decisions locked in change control
- Trade-offs documented in business case and project plan
- Risk: Values may shift during 18-month delivery; formal governance struggles to adapt

**Sarah's office renovation (predictive, closed project)**:
- Steering committee: Facilities, Finance, HR, Sustainability (monthly meetings)
- Pre-project: Aligned on LEED certification as non-negotiable (despite cost)
- During project: Budget pressure; committee reaffirmed sustainability commitment (didn't cut it)
- Post-project: Value conflict resolved through governance; all stakeholders felt heard

### Agile

**Challenge**: Values are revealed through continuous delivery; need mechanisms to surface and resolve conflicts early

**Approach**:
- Product Owner represents value/priority balance (should be backed by diverse stakeholder team)
- Sprint reviews include reflection on value delivery (are we satisfying competing values?)
- Backlog prioritization reflects value balance (not just financial ROI)
- Value conflicts surface when sprint goals compete (e.g., "Feature X creates good experience but poor architecture")

**Sarah's expense system (agile)**:
- Product Owner role held by Finance Manager (financial focus) with advisory input from HR (adoption focus) and IT (quality focus)
- Sprint planning: Discuss trade-offs explicitly ("This feature is good for user experience but weak on data architecture. Do we build it clean or ship it fast?")
- Value conflict: Speed (get to 80% adoption early) vs. Quality (foundation needs to be solid). Resolution: Core features built solid; nice-to-have features can be quick iterations

### Hybrid

**Challenge**: Program-level and workstream-level value priorities may conflict; need governance layers that balance both

**Approach**:
- Program governance: Addresses strategic value conflicts (Finance vs. Sustainability; Speed vs. Quality)
- Workstream autonomy: Teams have flexibility on approach within program-level constraints
- Value escalation: Workstream conflicts escalated to program governance
- Trade-off decisions made at level appropriate to scope (minor: team decides; major: program decides)

**Sarah's transformation program (hybrid)**:
- Program governance (monthly): CFO, CPO, CIO, COO, Chief Product Officer, Program Lead
- Program-level alignment: "We will deliver strategic capability with sustainable practices. Workstreams have autonomy on approach."
- Workstream 1 conflict: Finance wants to skip change management; HR resists; Program governance decides: "Core change management is prerequisite. Include it."
- Workstream 2 conflict: Product wants to cut architecture review to save 2 weeks; CIO resists; Program governance decides: "Architecture quality is non-negotiable. Extend timeline or reduce scope instead."

## Bringing It Together: A Stakeholder Value Framework

When facing competing stakeholder values:

1. **Surface them explicitly** (don't hide conflict)
2. **Understand the rationale** (why each stakeholder's value matters)
3. **Identify non-negotiables vs. negotiables** (what can't be compromised; what can)
4. **Explore integration opportunities** (solutions that satisfy multiple values)
5. **Make value-based trade-offs** (when integration isn't possible)
6. **Ensure informed consent** (stakeholders understand trade-off and approve)
7. **Document the decision** (rationale, trade-offs, approval)
8. **Govern appropriately** (structure that handles value conflicts at the right level)
9. **Track consequences** (did trade-off work as predicted?)

The goal: Transform competing values from a source of conflict into a source of organizational strength and balanced decision-making.

## Reflection: What Did You Learn?

As you complete this section, consider:

1. **For your projects**: What competing stakeholder values exist? Are they surfaced and discussed?
2. **For governance**: What decision model would work best for your organization?
3. **For leadership**: Can you facilitate conversations about competing values without imposing your preference?
4. **For decision-making**: Can you recommend trade-offs based on value analysis, not politics?

In the final section (16f), you'll test your understanding of Chapter 16 concepts through scenario-based practice questions.
