## Introduction

During the office renovation project review, Sarah was preparing a final status report when the facilities director raised an unexpected question: "I've been asked to report on the project's environmental and social impact. Can you help? What's our carbon footprint? Did we prioritize local employment? What's our waste diversion rate?"

Sarah realized she'd focused entirely on delivering on time and within budget. But the organization—and increasingly, stakeholders like customers, investors, and regulators—wanted to know: **Was this project done sustainably?**

This question opened her eyes to a broader trend. Her transformation program included a new diversity and inclusion objective. Her expense system would collect data on employee demographics (are women using the system equally? What about accessibility for people with disabilities?). Her office renovation had been built to LEED standards, but she'd deferred sustainability features to save cost. Those deferrals would haunt the organization for decades.

This section introduces you to ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) thinking—concepts that are increasingly important in the 2026 PMP exam and reflect how modern organizations evaluate project success.

## What Is ESG and Why Does It Matter?

### ESG Framework

**E – Environmental**: How does the project impact the natural world?
- Carbon emissions and climate impact
- Resource consumption (water, materials, energy)
- Waste generation and circular economy practices
- Biodiversity and ecosystem impact
- Lifecycle environmental footprint

**S – Social**: How does the project impact people and communities?
- Labor practices and fair treatment in supply chains
- Community impact and local economic development
- Diversity, equity, and inclusion in project team and beneficiaries
- Accessibility and inclusive design
- Health and safety (beyond minimum compliance)
- Employee wellbeing and cultural impact

**G – Governance**: How is the project managed with integrity and accountability?
- Ethical decision-making and conflict resolution
- Transparency and stakeholder engagement
- Regulatory compliance and beyond
- Risk management including long-term organizational risks
- Accountability for benefits and impacts

### Why ESG Matters for Project Managers

**1. Stakeholder expectations are evolving**
- Investors increasingly evaluate companies on ESG performance (ESG scores affect stock valuation)
- Customers prefer vendors with strong ESG records (especially millennials and Gen Z)
- Employees want to work for organizations aligned with their values
- Regulators are tightening ESG requirements (carbon reporting, supply chain transparency, diversity)

**2. ESG is a form of long-term value creation**
- Environmental investments prevent future costs (climate resilience, regulatory penalties)
- Social investments build organizational reputation and talent attraction
- Governance investments prevent scandals and regulatory issues
- **ESG is not separate from benefits; it's part of sustainable value creation**

**3. Organizations increasingly integrate ESG into project selection**
- "Does this project advance our sustainability goals?" is now asked alongside "What's the ROI?"
- Projects with negative ESG impact face stakeholder resistance
- Projects with strong ESG alignment get funding priority

**4. The 2026 PMP Exam emphasizes ESG**
- Chapter 1 of the study guide highlighted ESG as emerging emphasis in the exam
- Questions test whether you integrate ESG into project decisions
- Exam scenarios include ESG trade-offs (e.g., "Cost-effective vendor with poor labor practices vs. more expensive vendor with certified fair labor")

## Environmental Sustainability in Projects

### Three Dimensions of Environmental Impact

**1. Manufacturing/Construction Phase**
- Resources consumed to build/create the deliverable
- Waste generated during manufacturing
- Transportation and supply chain emissions
- Worker safety and environmental practices

**Example - Office Renovation**:
- Materials: Recycled content? Responsibly sourced? Sustainable forestry?
- Construction: Waste diverted from landfill? Emissions minimized?
- Transportation: Materials sourced locally where possible?
- Practices: Worker safety; minimal environmental disruption during construction

**2. Operations Phase**
- How the asset operates once delivered
- Energy consumption, water use, emissions
- Ongoing maintenance and replacement needs
- Lifecycle cost vs. environmental trade-offs

**Example - Office Renovation**:
- LEED certification: Better HVAC, LED lighting, water conservation reduce ongoing operational environmental impact
- Operating cost reduction ($120K/year from energy savings) is also environmental benefit (less energy consumed)
- Longevity: Will the renovation last 30 years (good) or require major refurbishment in 10 years (poor)?

**3. Decommissioning/End-of-Life Phase**
- What happens when the asset is no longer useful
- Recycling, disposal, environmental impact of decommissioning
- Potential for reuse or circular economy practices
- Long-term environmental liability

**Example - Office Renovation**:
- Old HVAC system and fixtures: Recycled or disposed?
- Flooring and finishes: Are they reusable? Recyclable? Toxic?
- Building design: Can the space be repurposed for different uses, or is it locked into specific function?

### Integrating Environmental Thinking into Project Decisions

**At Project Selection (Chapter 15)**:
- Does this project advance environmental goals?
- What's the lifecycle environmental impact?
- Compare vendors/approaches on environmental criteria, not just cost

**At Planning (Chapter 11)**:
- Procurement standards: Require sustainable sourcing, certified materials, responsible practices
- Operations planning: Assume the system will operate for X years; what's the total environmental impact?
- Design choices: Trade off upfront cost vs. long-term environmental impact

**At Execution (Chapter 13)**:
- Vendor management: Monitor ESG compliance throughout delivery
- Waste and resource management: Minimize waste, recycle where possible
- Team practices: Model sustainability (video meetings instead of travel; paperless workflows)

**At Closure (Chapter 14)**:
- Document environmental impact of project (carbon footprint, waste diverted, resources saved)
- Plan for sustainably maintaining the asset going forward
- Capture lessons learned about environmental practices

## Social Responsibility in Projects

### Four Areas of Social Impact

**1. Labor and Supply Chain Practices**

**Challenge**: Projects often rely on vendors, contractors, and supply chains with poor labor practices

**Examples**:
- Manufacturing components in countries with low labor standards, child labor risks, safety violations
- Construction contracts with subcontractors who pay below living wages or exploit workers
- Consulting services from vendors that undervalue diverse talent

**What to do**:
- Establish vendor ESG standards: "All vendors must certify compliance with ILO standards, living wage policies, safe working conditions"
- Audit supply chains: Don't just assume vendors comply; verify
- Cost of ESG compliance: Usually 5-15% premium vs. lowest-cost option
- Value of ESG compliance: Avoids reputational risk; aligns with organizational values; attracts conscious consumers

**Example - Transformation Program**:
Sarah's transformation program included implementation partners from different countries. She required:
- Verification of living wage compliance
- Certification of safe working conditions
- Verification of no child labor or forced labor
- Commitment to diversity and inclusion in staffing the project
- Cost impact: +10% consulting budget
- Value: Project can be marketed as "ethically implemented"; reduces risk of labor violations scandal

**2. Community Impact and Local Economic Development**

**Challenge**: Large projects can benefit or harm local communities; projects can extract value or create it

**Examples**:
- Construction project: Uses local labor, sources local materials → benefits community; vs. imports all labor and materials → misses opportunity
- Software project: Implemented for global company; training provided to local employees → builds local capability; vs. imported team trains no one → transfers no knowledge
- Facility project: Creates local jobs → community benefit; vs. automated facility → displaced workers without retraining

**What to do**:
- Assess community impact: Who benefits? Who bears costs?
- Look for opportunities to build local capability: Training, local hiring, local sourcing
- Plan for equitable distribution of benefits and mitigation of harms
- Report on community impact as part of project benefits

**Example - Office Renovation**:
Sarah's renovation could have:
- Sourced materials from local suppliers (supporting local businesses)
- Used local contractors and construction workers (supporting local employment)
- Provided training on LEED practices to facility management staff (building local capability)
- Actual approach: Bid to lowest cost (often national suppliers and chains); missed community building opportunity

**3. Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion**

**Challenge**: Projects can perpetuate or disrupt organizational inequities

**Examples**:
- Project staffing: Are project team, vendors, and beneficiaries diverse? Or is opportunity concentrated?
- Technology design: Is the deliverable accessible to people with disabilities? Or does it exclude them?
- Requirements gathering: Are all stakeholder voices heard? Or are some marginalized?
- Benefits distribution: Do all beneficiary groups realize benefits equally? Or do some get shortchanged?

**What to do**:
- Assess diversity of project team and vendor pool: Actively recruit diverse suppliers and team members
- Design with accessibility in mind: WCAG compliance for digital projects; physical accessibility for facilities
- Gather requirements from diverse stakeholders: Ensure underrepresented voices are heard
- Monitor benefits realization by demographic group: Are benefits equitably distributed?

**Example - Expense System**:
Sarah should assess:
- Is the system equally usable by people with different abilities? (Text-to-speech for vision impairment? Keyboard navigation for mobility impairment?)
- Do all employee demographic groups use the system equally? (Men/women? Young/old? Different departments?)
- Were diverse perspectives included in design? (Input from employees with disabilities? Employees in underrepresented groups?)
- Do all groups realize benefits equally? (Track by demographic; adjust if some groups lag)

**4. Health, Safety, and Wellbeing**

**Challenge**: Project delivery can impact employee health and safety

**Examples**:
- Construction project safety: Industry-standard 8.5% accident rates vs. best-in-class <1% injury rates; significant difference in human cost
- Software project: Can cause eyestrain, ergonomic issues, mental health impacts; or can be designed to minimize these
- Transformation: Change can be stressful; rushed implementation can harm employee wellbeing; vs. well-managed change that respects people

**What to do**:
- Plan for health and safety beyond minimum legal compliance
- Include mental health and wellbeing in change management
- Assess ergonomic and design impacts of technology projects
- Provide support for employees affected by project changes
- Track wellbeing metrics: Turnover, stress-related absences, engagement scores

**Example - Transformation Program**:
Sarah's program should:
- Plan for change stress: Provide counseling, support for employees struggling with change
- Design for sustainable pace: Don't burn out teams for timeline
- Create psychological safety: Support people learning new ways of working
- Monitor wellbeing metrics: Identify and support those struggling most

## Governance and Ethical Decision-Making

### Governance Principles in Projects

**Transparency**: Stakeholders understand how decisions are made and what trade-offs exist

**Accountability**: Clear responsibility for decisions and their consequences

**Fairness**: Decision-making considers impact on all stakeholders, not just those with most power

**Integrity**: Decisions align with organizational values, even when harder or more expensive

### Ethical Dilemmas in Projects

Projects often present ethical trade-offs:

**Example 1: Cost vs. Responsible Sourcing**
- Scenario: Vendor A costs 20% less but has unverified labor practices; Vendor B costs 20% more but certified responsible
- Ethical choice: Depends on organizational values; but should be explicit, not hidden
- Wrong approach: Buy from Vendor A, hide the fact, hope no one notices
- Right approach: Present to sponsor: "Vendor A saves $200K but carries labor practice risk. Vendor B costs $200K more but eliminates risk. Which do we prefer?"

**Example 2: Timeline vs. Sustainability**
- Scenario: Can save 4 weeks by cutting environmental design phase
- Ethical choice: Environmental impact matters; short-term timeline doesn't justify long-term environmental harm
- Wrong approach: Cut the work, deliver on time, don't mention the environmental impact
- Right approach: "Cutting environmental design saves 4 weeks but creates 30-year $500K environmental cost. Should we extend timeline?"

**Example 3: Efficiency vs. Human Impact**
- Scenario: New system is more efficient but will displace 20 employees
- Ethical choice: Automation is fine; but displacement without retraining or transition is not
- Wrong approach: Implement system, lay off displaced workers
- Right approach: "This creates efficiency but displaces 20 employees. We should plan retraining, redeployment, or transition support before implementation."

### Governance Mechanisms for ESG

**Project Charter**:
- Include ESG objectives alongside schedule/cost/scope
- Example: "Project will achieve LEED Silver certification; use local suppliers for 60%+ of materials; ensure 40%+ women on project team"

**Steering Committee**:
- Include ESG expertise in governance
- Escalate ESG trade-offs (e.g., "Should we cut environmental design to save cost?")

**Change Control**:
- Evaluate ESG impact of proposed changes
- Example: "This change reduces cost but removes sustainable materials requirement. Approve or reject?"

**Stakeholder Engagement**:
- Include ESG stakeholders (environmental groups, community representatives, diversity advocates)
- Gather perspectives on ESG impact, not just technical feasibility

**Benefits Tracking**:
- Include ESG metrics in benefits measurement
- Example: Office renovation benefits = cost savings + environmental impact + community employment created

---

## Integrating ESG Into Different Delivery Approaches

### Predictive Projects

**Characteristic**: ESG can be planned upfront; embedded in requirements and design

**Approach**:
- Define ESG requirements in charter and planning
- Vendor selection includes ESG criteria (RFP specifies environmental standards, labor practices, diversity requirements)
- Design phase incorporates ESG (sustainable materials, accessible design, community engagement)
- Execution phase monitors ESG compliance
- Closure includes ESG measurement and reporting

**Advantage**: ESG can be designed in from the start, not retrofitted

**Risk**: ESG requirements sometimes treated as "nice to have" and cut under cost pressure; resist this

**Example - Office Renovation (Predictive)**:
- Charter: LEED Silver certification; 40% women on construction team; local supplier sourcing
- Design: HVAC efficiency, LED lighting, sustainable materials specified
- Vendor selection: Evaluate on ESG criteria, not just cost
- Execution: Monitor compliance
- Closure: Report environmental impact, community employment created, diversity metrics

### Agile Projects

**Characteristic**: ESG evolves during delivery; built into product definition and team values

**Approach**:
- Define ESG vision upfront ("Product will be accessible; built with diverse team; ethically sourced components")
- Build ESG into Definition of Done (e.g., "Code meets accessibility standards; no 3rd-party components with labor practice risk")
- Sprint planning includes ESG tasks (accessibility refactoring, vendor ESG audit, inclusive design iteration)
- Continuous engagement with ESG stakeholders (accessibility advocates, community representatives)
- Sprint reviews include ESG metrics (accessibility compliance progress, team diversity, etc.)

**Advantage**: ESG can be tested and refined continuously; emerges from team values

**Risk**: ESG can be deferred as "backlog item" when deadline pressure emerges; protect it as non-negotiable

**Example - Expense System (Agile)**:
- Product vision: "Accessible, inclusive system; built with diverse team; sourced from responsible vendors"
- Definition of Done: All features tested for accessibility; no deferred accessibility work; vendor ESG status monitored
- Backlog: Includes accessibility improvements, equity analysis, supplier audits alongside features
- Sprint reviews: Track accessibility compliance, team composition, supplier ESG status
- Protect: Don't defer accessibility to meet deadline

### Hybrid Programs

**Characteristic**: ESG objectives set at program level; team-level flexibility on approach

**Approach**:
- Program governance defines ESG objectives (sustainability goals, equity targets, governance standards)
- Workstreams have autonomy on approach but must align to ESG objectives
- Workstream planning includes ESG tasks and metrics
- Program governance monitors ESG performance across workstreams
- Escalate ESG trade-offs: "This workstream proposes cost-saving cut that reduces environmental benefit. Should we proceed?"

**Advantage**: Organization-level ESG strategy cascades; team-level flexibility remains

**Risk**: Workstreams may not prioritize ESG; governance discipline required

**Example - Transformation Program (Hybrid)**:
- Program governance: "Program will achieve 40% women on core teams; reduce carbon footprint by 20%; build local capability through training"
- Workstream 1 (Organization): Design new structure with diversity goals; build local management capability
- Workstream 2 (Tools & Infrastructure): Select vendors on ESG criteria; train local teams; minimize carbon footprint of infrastructure
- Program reviews: Track ESG metrics across workstreams; escalate barriers

## The ESG Business Case: Overcoming Skepticism

### Common Objection

Skeptical sponsor: "ESG is important, but it costs more. We need to deliver within budget. Can we defer ESG for now?"

### Your Response

**1. Clarify what ESG is (and isn't)**
"ESG isn't a cost center; it's a value driver. It includes avoiding long-term costs (regulatory penalties, environmental remediation, reputational damage) and creating long-term value (brand loyalty, talent attraction, operational efficiency)."

**2. Quantify the business case**
- **Environmental**: "LEED certification costs $X more upfront. It returns $Y/year in energy savings for 30 years = $30Y lifetime benefit."
- **Social**: "Responsible sourcing costs 10% more. It prevents reputational risk if labor violations discovered (estimated $5M+ damage). And it attracts conscious consumers worth $2M+ additional revenue."
- **Governance**: "Ethics training and governance processes cost $X. They prevent compliance violations worth $Y+ and protect reputation worth $Z+."

**3. Reframe as risk mitigation**
"ESG isn't optional extras. It's how we avoid long-term costs:
- Environmental: Don't be the company that gets carbon-taxed or needs environmental remediation
- Social: Don't be the company with labor scandal or discrimination lawsuit
- Governance: Don't be the company with compliance violation or ethics investigation"

**4. Point to stakeholder expectations**
"Our customers, investors, and employees increasingly expect ESG commitment. If we ignore it:
- Investors downgrade our ESG score (affects stock valuation)
- Conscious consumers choose competitors
- Best talent wants to work for responsible companies"

**5. Show peer examples**
"Here's what comparable organizations did: They invested in ESG upfront. They saw: (1) avoided long-term costs, (2) increased brand loyalty, (3) improved talent attraction, (4) regulatory compliance advantage."
