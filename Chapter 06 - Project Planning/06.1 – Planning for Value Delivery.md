## ECO Alignment

This chapter addresses the following tasks from the PMP Certification Exam Content Outline (ECO):

| Domain | Task | Coverage |
|--------|------|----------|
| Process | Task 2: Develop and Manage Project Scope | Primary |
| Process | Task 3: Help Ensure Value-Based Delivery | Primary |
| Process | Task 4: Plan and Manage Resources | Primary |
| Process | Task 5: Plan and Manage Procurement | Primary |
| Process | Task 6: Plan and Manage Finance | Primary |
| Process | Task 7: Plan and Optimize Quality | Primary |
| Process | Task 8: Plan and Manage Schedule | Primary |

**How This Chapter Covers the ECO Tasks:**

These seven tasks collectively require you to develop a comprehensive project plan including requirements, scope, schedule, budget, quality standards, resource allocation, and procurement strategy. They also require planning for value delivery at each phase.

**Coverage in This Chapter:**
- **Requirements**: Collecting, analyzing, and refining requirements—the foundation for all planning
- **Scope**: Defining scope, obtaining stakeholder agreement, and creating a baseline
- **Schedule**: Work breakdown, sequencing, dependencies, milestones, and timeline development
- **Cost**: Estimation, budgeting, and financial planning
- **Quality**: Quality planning, acceptance criteria, and standards
- **Resources and procurement**: Team allocation and procurement strategy development
- **Knowledge check**: Question set to validate planning concepts and PMI-aligned decision patterns

This chapter emphasizes that planning is not a one-time event but an ongoing conversation that adapts as the project progresses. Effective planning creates clarity, manages stakeholder expectations, and provides a baseline against which actual performance is measured.

### The Performance Measurement Baseline (PMB)

The Performance Measurement Baseline is the core concept that integrates scope, schedule, and cost for performance measurement. It's essential for earned value management and project control.

**PMB Components**:
1. **Scope Baseline**: Project scope statement, WBS, and WBS dictionary
2. **Schedule Baseline**: The approved schedule model with planned dates
3. **Cost Baseline**: The time-phased budget authorized for the project

**PMB Development Process**:
1. **Create WBS**: Decompose scope into manageable work packages
2. **Develop Schedule**: Sequence activities and determine planned dates
3. **Estimate Costs**: Determine costs for each work package
4. **Time-Phase Budgets**: Assign costs to time periods to create cash flow
5. **Reserve Analysis**: Add contingency and management reserves
6. **Baseline Integration**: Ensure all three components are aligned
7. **Formal Approval**: Obtain stakeholder sign-off on the integrated baseline

**EVM Planning Requirements** (from EVM Standard):
- **Control Account Planning**: Establish control accounts at appropriate WBS levels
- **Work Package Definition**: Create detailed work packages with measurable outcomes
- **Responsibility Assignment**: Assign Control Account Managers and work package owners
- **Measurement Methods**: Define how progress will be measured (fixed formula, milestones, etc.)
- **Reporting Periods**: Establish when performance will be measured and reported

**Sarah's PMB Experience**:
For the Office Renovation project, Sarah's PMB included:
- **Scope**: 75 work packages organized into 8 control accounts
- **Schedule**: 20-week timeline with 5 major milestones
- **Cost**: $500,000 budget with $30,000 contingency and $20,000 management reserve
- **Measurement**: Fixed formula (0/50/100) for construction, weighted milestones for systems

The integrated PMB enabled Sarah to track earned value and provide stakeholders with accurate forecasts throughout the project. (For EVM implementation and tracking, see [Chapter 09.1](../Chapter%2009%20-%20Monitoring%20and%20Closing/09.1%20–%20Monitoring,%20Controlling,%20and%20Closing.md))

## Introduction: Planning as an Ongoing Conversation

Planning is not a phase that ends. It's a conversation that evolves throughout the project lifecycle.

In traditional project management thinking, planning happened upfront: Gather requirements, define scope, build the schedule, estimate costs, baseline everything, and then execute against the plan. Changes were exceptions, requiring formal control processes.

But modern project delivery recognizes that planning is continuous. The question is not whether you plan, but *when* and *how much* detail you plan at different points in the project.

**Planning in Predictive Projects:**
Planning happens early and comprehensively. You invest significant effort upfront to create detailed baselines for scope, schedule, cost, quality, resources, and procurement. These baselines become your control points. Changes happen, but they're managed through formal change control processes.

Predictive planning works best when:
- Requirements are well-understood and stable
- The solution approach is proven
- Stakeholders need cost and schedule certainty upfront
- Compliance or contracting requires detailed documentation

**Planning in Agile Projects:**
Planning happens iteratively and incrementally. You establish a product vision and high-level roadmap, but detailed planning happens just-in-time. You plan sprints (or iterations) one at a time, refining the backlog based on what you learn. The scope emerges; time and team capacity are fixed.

Agile planning works best when:
- Requirements are uncertain or evolving
- Innovation requires experimentation
- Feedback loops drive better outcomes
- Time-to-market demands rapid delivery of value

**Planning in Hybrid Projects:**
Planning combines upfront investment in program-level roadmaps and governance with adaptive planning at the team level. You might plan releases and milestones predictively, while individual teams plan their work iteratively.

Hybrid planning works best when:
- Different parts of the project have different levels of uncertainty
- Organizational constraints require predictive governance
- Teams benefit from adaptive execution
- Integration points need coordination across multiple delivery streams

**The Planning Paradox:**
Over-planning in an uncertain environment creates waste: You build detailed plans that become obsolete as soon as reality intrudes. Under-planning in a well-understood environment creates risk: You miss dependencies, underestimate costs, and fail to secure necessary resources.

The art of planning is matching your planning approach to your project context.

## Integration: How Planning Differs by Delivery Approach

Let's follow Sarah as she plans three different projects to see how planning varies radically by approach.

### Sarah's Office Renovation (Predictive)

Sarah is planning the renovation of a regional headquarters building. The project has:
- Fixed scope: Architectural drawings are approved; building codes are non-negotiable
- Long-lead items: Custom furniture, HVAC equipment, security systems
- Regulatory requirements: Building permits, inspections, compliance documentation
- Hard deadline: Must complete before lease expires in 9 months

**Sarah's Planning Approach:**

1. **Requirements**: Detailed interviews with department heads, facility managers, and compliance officers. Requirements documented in a 60-page specification, reviewed and approved by senior leadership.

2. **Scope**: Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) decomposing the project into phases (design, permitting, demolition, construction, systems installation, inspection, move-in) and work packages within each phase.

3. **Schedule**: Network diagram showing dependencies. Critical path identified (permitting → structural work → HVAC installation → inspection). Buffer time added for inspection cycles. Gantt chart showing 9-month timeline.

4. **Cost**: Bottom-up estimates from vendors and contractors. Contingency reserve (15%) for known risks like material price fluctuations. Management reserve (10%) for unknown unknowns.

5. **Quality**: Building codes, safety standards, accessibility requirements. Inspection schedule aligned to permit requirements. Acceptance criteria for each deliverable.

6. **Resources and Procurement**: Contractor RFPs issued 3 months before work starts. Fixed-price contracts with penalty clauses for late delivery. Internal project team identified; facilities manager allocated 50% time.

**Sarah's planning invested 6 weeks upfront.** The result: A comprehensive project management plan with baselined scope, schedule, and budget. Changes require formal approval through the change control board.

**Why predictive works here:** The renovation has well-defined requirements, proven approaches, regulatory constraints, and stakeholder need for cost/schedule certainty.

### Sarah's Expense System (Agile)

Sarah is leading development of a new employee expense management system. The project has:
- Uncertain scope: Users say "make it easier," but detailed workflows are unclear
- Technology options: Cloud platforms, mobile apps, integration APIs—multiple viable approaches
- Competitive pressure: Finance wants to launch something in 6 months
- User feedback critical: Adoption depends on real user experience, not specifications

**Sarah's Planning Approach:**

1. **Requirements**: Product vision workshop with finance stakeholders. User story mapping to identify high-level user journeys. Stories captured in a backlog, prioritized by business value, but details deferred.

2. **Scope**: Product roadmap showing 3 releases over 6 months. Release 1: Basic expense submission and approval. Release 2: Mobile app and receipt scanning. Release 3: Integration with accounting system. Detailed scope for each sprint emerges through backlog refinement.

3. **Schedule**: Fixed 2-week sprints. Team velocity determines how much work fits in each sprint. No detailed task-level schedule; sprint planning happens every 2 weeks based on current priorities.

4. **Cost**: Fixed team (6 people: product owner, scrum master, 4 developers) for 6 months. Cost per sprint is known; scope varies to fit the team's capacity.

5. **Quality**: Definition of Done includes automated tests, code review, and stakeholder demo. Continuous integration; testing happens within each sprint, not as a separate phase.

6. **Resources and Procurement**: Team dedicated full-time. Cloud infrastructure procured with flexible pay-as-you-go contract. No long-term vendor commitments; decisions made just-in-time.

**Sarah's planning invested 2 weeks upfront** (vision, roadmap, team setup). **Then 2-4 hours every sprint** for sprint planning and backlog refinement. Planning is continuous and responsive.

**Why agile works here:** Requirements are uncertain, user feedback drives value, and the team needs flexibility to adapt based on what they learn.

### Sarah's Digital Transformation Program (Hybrid)

Sarah is leading a multi-year program to transform customer service operations across 15 regional offices. The program has:
- Strategic scope: Clear business outcomes (reduce response time, increase satisfaction, lower costs)
- Uncertain implementation: Each region has different systems, processes, and readiness
- Phased rollout: 3 regions per quarter over 18 months
- Multiple teams: Centralized platform development (agile) + regional implementation teams (predictive)

**Sarah's Planning Approach:**

1. **Requirements**: Business requirements defined upfront at program level (service level agreements, technology standards, compliance requirements). Regional implementation requirements gathered iteratively as each region enters the rollout queue.

2. **Scope**: Program roadmap with major milestones and deliverables (platform releases, regional go-lives). Platform team uses backlog and sprints. Regional teams use detailed implementation plans.

3. **Schedule**: Program-level Gantt chart showing phased rollout over 18 months. Platform team uses sprint cadence. Regional teams plan their implementation based on platform availability.

4. **Cost**: Program budget allocated by phase and region. Platform team: Fixed cost per sprint. Regional teams: Bottom-up estimates for training, data migration, and go-live support.

5. **Quality**: Program-wide quality standards and acceptance criteria. Platform team: Definition of Done per sprint. Regional teams: Detailed test plans and user acceptance testing.

6. **Resources and Procurement**: Core platform team dedicated. Regional implementation teams mobilized just-in-time. Vendor contracts for infrastructure (fixed) and implementation support (time-and-materials).

**Sarah's planning invested 8 weeks upfront** for program charter, roadmap, and governance structure. **Then continuous planning** at two levels: Monthly program steering (adjusting roadmap) and sprint/regional planning (detailed execution).

**Why hybrid works here:** Strategic direction needs predictability; implementation needs adaptability. Different parts of the program have different levels of uncertainty.

## The Planning Trade-Off Triangle

Every planning decision involves trade-offs:

- **Scope vs. Schedule vs. Cost**: Adding scope increases cost or schedule. Compressing schedule may increase cost or reduce scope. Cutting cost may force scope reduction or schedule extension.

- **Detail vs. Flexibility**: Detailed planning provides control and predictability but reduces flexibility. Adaptive planning maintains flexibility but provides less upfront certainty.

- **Upfront Investment vs. Just-In-Time Planning**: Investing in comprehensive upfront planning reduces uncertainty but may create waste if plans become obsolete. Just-in-time planning preserves flexibility but may miss critical dependencies.

**Sarah's rule of thumb:** Plan in detail what you know and need to control. Leave flexibility where uncertainty is high and learning is essential.

## Planning and Risk

Weak planning creates risk:
- **Unclear requirements** lead to rework and stakeholder dissatisfaction
- **Unrealistic estimates** lead to budget overruns and schedule delays
- **Unmanaged dependencies** lead to delays and integration failures
- **Poor resource planning** leads to bottlenecks and team burnout
- **Inadequate quality planning** leads to defects and low adoption

But over-planning also creates risk:
- **Premature commitment** to detailed plans before you understand the problem
- **Rigidity** that prevents the team from adapting to feedback
- **Wasted effort** creating plans that become obsolete
- **False confidence** from detailed plans that don't reflect reality

The goal of planning is to reduce risk while maintaining appropriate flexibility.

### 6.1g – Knowledge Check

1.  **Requirements Type:** A stakeholder states, "The new customer portal must be able to handle 10,000 concurrent users with a response time of less than 2 seconds." This is an example of a:
    *   A) Business Requirement
    *   B) Functional Requirement
    *   C) Non-Functional Requirement
    *   D) Transition Requirement

2.  **Scope Management:** In a highly uncertain project with evolving user needs, the product owner insists on a fixed, detailed scope statement and a comprehensive WBS before development begins. What is the MOST likely consequence of this approach?
    *   A) Reduced risk of scope creep and rework.
    *   B) Increased team morale due to clear direction.
    *   C) Significant rework and stakeholder dissatisfaction as requirements change.
    *   D) Faster time-to-market due to upfront clarity.

3.  **Schedule Compression:** Your project is behind schedule. To recover, you decide to perform two critical path activities in parallel that were originally planned to be sequential, accepting an increased risk of rework. Which schedule compression technique are you using?
    *   A) Crashing
    *   B) Fast Tracking
    *   C) Resource Leveling
    *   D) Resource Smoothing

4.  **Cost Estimation:** You are asked to provide a quick, high-level estimate for a new project in the very early stages. You use historical data from a similar past project to derive this estimate. Which estimation technique is this?
    *   A) Bottom-Up Estimating
    *   B) Parametric Estimating
    *   C) Three-Point Estimating
    *   D) Analogous Estimating

5.  **Quality Management:** In an agile project, which quality tool defines the criteria that must be met before a user story is considered complete?
    *   A) Quality Control Chart
    *   B) Acceptance Criteria
    *   C) Definition of Done
    *   D) Traceability Matrix

6.  **Procurement:** Your project requires a specialized component with a clear, stable specification. You want to transfer most of the cost risk to the vendor. Which contract type is MOST appropriate?
    *   A) Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF)
    *   B) Time and Materials (T&M)
    *   C) Fixed-Price (FP)
    *   D) Cost Plus Incentive Fee (CPIF)

**Answers:**
1.  **C** - This describes a quality attribute (performance) of the system, not a specific function or business need.
2.  **C** - Forcing a fixed, detailed scope on an uncertain project leads to friction and rework when requirements inevitably evolve.
3.  **B** - Fast tracking involves performing activities in parallel that would normally be sequential, increasing risk.
4.  **D** - Analogous estimating uses historical data from similar projects for quick, high-level estimates.
5.  **C** - The Definition of Done is a critical agile quality gate that ensures stories meet a predefined quality standard.
6.  **C** - Fixed-Price contracts transfer the most cost risk to the vendor, making them suitable for well-defined scopes.
