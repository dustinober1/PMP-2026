# 13e – Team Performance and Accountability

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will be able to:

1. Motivate teams during the challenges and pressures of execution
2. Create accountability without micromanagement
3. Provide effective feedback and recognition that drives performance
4. Identify and address team performance issues proactively
5. Sustain team morale throughout different project phases
6. Balance individual performance with team cohesion
7. Apply servant leadership principles during execution challenges

## Introduction: Execution Reveals Character

Planning is optimistic. Execution is where optimism meets reality. This is where teams are tested:
- Can they deliver under pressure?
- Do they maintain quality when schedules are tight?
- Will they surface problems or hide them?
- Can they collaborate effectively when coordination is complex?
- Do they hold each other accountable or let things slide?

The project manager's role during execution is not to do the work—it's to create an environment where the team can perform at their best. This requires:
- **Motivation**: Keeping the team energized and engaged despite challenges
- **Accountability**: Ensuring commitments are met without micromanaging
- **Recognition**: Celebrating successes and learning from failures
- **Psychological safety**: Creating an environment where problems can be surfaced without fear
- **Servant leadership**: Removing impediments and supporting the team

This section explores how Sarah manages team performance and accountability across her three projects, each presenting different team dynamics and challenges.

## Motivation During Execution: Keeping Energy High

Execution is a marathon. Teams start projects with enthusiasm, but energy wanes as challenges accumulate. The project manager must sustain motivation throughout.

### Understanding Motivation: Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic

**Intrinsic motivation**: Internal drivers—purpose, mastery, autonomy (Daniel Pink's framework from Chapter 6)
- **Purpose**: The work matters and creates value
- **Mastery**: Growing skills and competence
- **Autonomy**: Having control over how work is done

**Extrinsic motivation**: External drivers—bonuses, recognition, promotions

Research shows intrinsic motivation is more sustainable and effective for knowledge work. Extrinsic motivators provide short-term boosts but don't create lasting engagement.

### Purpose: Connecting Work to Impact

Teams perform better when they understand why their work matters.

**Example – Expense System**: In Sprint 8, the team is working on a technical infrastructure refactoring—not a visible feature, just backend improvements. The team's energy is low: "This isn't exciting. When do we get to build cool features again?"

Sarah reinforces purpose: "I know refactoring isn't glamorous. But here's why it matters: Right now, the system takes 5 seconds to load an expense report. That doesn't sound like much, but with 10,000 employees submitting expenses every month, we're wasting 13,000 hours per year waiting for pages to load. This refactoring will reduce load time to under 1 second. You're literally giving thousands of hours back to our employees to focus on meaningful work instead of staring at loading screens."

The team's perspective shifts. The refactoring now feels purposeful, not just a chore. Energy increases.

**Lesson**: Connect the work to the impact, even for mundane tasks.

### Mastery: Creating Growth Opportunities

Teams are motivated when they're learning and growing.

**Example – Transformation Program**: Sarah notices that one team member on the Change Management workstream has been doing the same type of work (drafting communication emails) for six weeks. The team member's engagement is declining.

Sarah creates a growth opportunity: "I noticed you've mastered communication emails. I'd like you to lead the next stakeholder workshop. It's a stretch assignment, but I think you're ready. I'll support you with coaching and feedback."

The team member is initially nervous but ultimately excited. The workshop goes well. The team member's engagement rebounds.

**Lesson**: Provide stretch assignments that build skills and prevent stagnation.

### Autonomy: Trust the Team to Decide How

Micromanagement kills motivation. Autonomy fuels it.

**Example – Expense System**: Sarah could dictate exactly how the development team should implement each feature—which technologies to use, how to structure the code, what testing approach to follow. But this would be micromanagement.

Instead, Sarah defines the "what" (product requirements) and lets the team define the "how":
- **Sarah's role**: "We need mobile approval functionality that works on iOS and Android, loads in under 2 seconds, and is accessible per WCAG standards."
- **Team's role**: The team decides to use a responsive web app rather than native apps, selects the technology stack, and designs the architecture.

This autonomy gives the team ownership. They're invested in the solution because they designed it.

**Lesson**: Define the goal and constraints, then let the team determine the approach.

### Extrinsic Motivators: When and How to Use Them

While intrinsic motivation is more sustainable, extrinsic motivators can provide short-term boosts in specific situations.

**Recognition**: Public acknowledgment of contributions

**Example – Transformation Program**: In a program-wide meeting, Sarah publicly recognizes the Technology workstream for completing a complex API integration two weeks ahead of schedule. The recognition is specific and genuine: "The Technology team worked through several technical challenges and collaborated closely with the vendor to deliver this integration early. This enables the Process team to start pilot testing on time. Outstanding work."

The Technology team feels valued. Other teams see that excellent work is noticed.

**Rewards**: Tangible incentives (bonuses, gifts, time off)

**Example – Office Renovation**: When the construction team works overtime to recover from a weather delay, Sarah buys lunch for the crew and sends a thank-you note to the general contractor's management. This small gesture shows appreciation and builds goodwill.

**When to use extrinsic motivators**:
- As a supplement to intrinsic motivation, not a replacement
- To recognize exceptional effort or results
- To provide short-term energy during challenging periods

**When NOT to use them**:
- As the primary motivation strategy (creates dependency on rewards)
- Inconsistently (creates perception of favoritism)
- For expected performance (rewards should be for exceeding expectations, not meeting them)

## Accountability: Creating Ownership Without Micromanagement

Accountability means team members take ownership of their commitments and deliver results. But creating accountability without micromanagement is a delicate balance.

### The Accountability Framework: Clear, Agreed, Visible, Consequential

**1. Clear Expectations**
Team members must know exactly what's expected—deliverables, quality standards, deadlines.

**Example – Transformation Program**: Sarah assigns a team member to create a change champion toolkit. But if Sarah says only "create a toolkit," the expectation is vague. What should it include? When is it due? What does success look like?

Sarah clarifies:
- **Deliverable**: Change champion toolkit including talking points, FAQs, email templates, and workshop facilitation guide
- **Quality standard**: Reviewed and approved by the Change Management Lead and tested with 5 pilot change champions
- **Deadline**: Draft by March 15, final by March 30
- **Success criteria**: Toolkit is used by 100% of change champions and receives 4.0+ satisfaction rating

Now the expectation is clear.

**2. Agreed Commitments**
Commitments are more powerful when the team member agrees to them rather than having them imposed.

**Example – Expense System**: During sprint planning, Sarah could assign tasks: "Developer 1, you'll build the mobile approval feature." But this is top-down assignment.

Instead, the team self-organizes:
- **Sarah (Product Owner)**: "The top priority for this sprint is mobile approval functionality."
- **Team**: The team discusses, estimates, and volunteers. Developer 1 says, "I'll take the mobile approval feature. I estimate it's 5 days of work."

Because Developer 1 volunteered and estimated, the commitment is owned, not imposed.

**3. Visible Progress**
Progress must be visible so both the team member and the project manager can track it.

**Example – Expense System**: The team uses a Kanban board showing each task's status: Backlog → In Progress → Code Review → Testing → Done.

Every day during standup, team members move their tasks across the board. Progress is visible to everyone. If a task is stuck in "Code Review" for three days, it's immediately apparent.

**Example – Transformation Program**: Sarah uses a program dashboard showing each workstream's progress toward phase milestones. Workstream leads update their status weekly. Progress (or lack thereof) is visible to everyone.

**Visibility creates natural accountability**—no one wants to be the red status in a sea of green.

**4. Consequential Follow-Through**
Accountability requires consequences—both positive (recognition for meeting commitments) and corrective (addressing missed commitments).

**Positive consequences**:

**Example – Expense System**: Developer 2 consistently delivers high-quality work on time. Sarah recognizes this in the sprint retrospective: "Developer 2's code quality has been outstanding—zero defects in the last three sprints. This is raising the bar for the whole team."

**Corrective consequences**:

**Example – Transformation Program**: A workstream lead consistently misses deliverable deadlines, impacting dependent workstreams. After two missed deadlines, Sarah addresses it directly:

"You've missed the last two deadlines (Feb 15 and March 1). This is delaying the Process team's work, which depends on your deliverables. What's causing the delays? What support do you need? And how can we ensure future commitments are met?"

This conversation is direct but constructive—it identifies the problem, explores causes, and seeks solutions.

If performance doesn't improve, Sarah escalates: reassigning work, providing additional resources, or (in extreme cases) replacing the team member.

**Accountability without consequences is just wishful thinking.**

### Self-Accountability in High-Performing Teams

The most effective teams hold themselves accountable—they don't need the project manager to enforce it.

**Example – Expense System**: During a sprint, Developer 3 realizes they underestimated a task—it's going to take 3 days instead of 1.5 days. This puts the sprint goal at risk.

Developer 3 proactively raises this in the daily standup: "I underestimated the notification feature. It's more complex than I thought. At my current pace, I won't finish by the sprint end. Can someone pair with me to get it done, or should we descope something else from the sprint?"

The team discusses and decides: Developer 1 pairs with Developer 3 for two days to complete the feature. The sprint goal is preserved.

**This is self-accountability**: Developer 3 didn't hide the problem or hope it would resolve itself. They surfaced it early and engaged the team in solving it.

**How to create self-accountability**:
1. **Hire for accountability**: Select team members who take ownership
2. **Model accountability**: The project manager must demonstrate accountability in their own commitments
3. **Create psychological safety**: Team members must feel safe surfacing problems
4. **Reinforce accountability behaviors**: Recognize and celebrate when team members demonstrate accountability

## Providing Feedback and Recognition

Effective feedback and recognition are essential for team performance. But many project managers struggle with this—they give too little feedback, or feedback that's vague, delayed, or poorly delivered.

### The Feedback Framework: Timely, Specific, Behavioral, Balanced

**1. Timely**
Feedback is most effective when it's given close to the event—immediately or within a few days.

**Example – Office Renovation**: Sarah observes the electrical contractor doing excellent work—outlets are precisely aligned, wire management is clean, work area is organized. She provides feedback that same day: "I noticed your work quality this morning—the outlet alignment is perfect and your wire management is excellent. This is exactly the standard we need."

Immediate feedback reinforces the behavior.

**2. Specific**
Vague feedback ("good job") is less effective than specific feedback ("your presentation clearly explained the risks and provided three actionable options").

**Example – Transformation Program**: After a stakeholder presentation, Sarah provides specific feedback:

**Vague**: "Good presentation."

**Specific**: "Your presentation was effective because you used real examples from the pilot testing, which made the benefits tangible for stakeholders. The risk section was clear and the mitigation strategies were practical. One area to improve: the timeline slide had too much detail—simplify it to just major milestones for executive audiences."

Specific feedback tells the team member exactly what to repeat and what to improve.

**3. Behavioral**
Focus feedback on behaviors (observable actions) rather than personality or character.

**Bad feedback**: "You're disorganized." (Attacks character)

**Good feedback**: "I noticed that the last two deliverables were submitted without the required supporting documentation. This creates rework because I have to ask for it after the fact. Going forward, please use the deliverable checklist to ensure all components are included."

Behavioral feedback is actionable—the team member knows exactly what to change.

**4. Balanced**
Effective feedback includes both reinforcing feedback (what to keep doing) and corrective feedback (what to improve).

**Example – Expense System**: In a one-on-one with Developer 2, Sarah provides balanced feedback:

**Reinforcing**: "Your code quality is consistently excellent. The automated tests you write catch edge cases that others miss. This is raising the quality bar for the whole team."

**Corrective**: "I've noticed you tend to work in isolation—you don't ask for help when you're stuck, and you don't offer help to others. I'd like to see you engage more with the team. Pair programming or code reviews are good opportunities for this."

Balanced feedback builds confidence (reinforcing) while driving improvement (corrective).

### Recognition: Making It Meaningful

Recognition motivates and reinforces desired behaviors. But recognition must be genuine and meaningful.

**Principles of Effective Recognition**:

**1. Public vs. Private**
Some people appreciate public recognition (in team meetings, email to leadership). Others prefer private recognition (one-on-one conversation, personal note).

**Example – Transformation Program**: Sarah learns that one team member (introverted personality) is uncomfortable with public recognition. Sarah provides recognition privately: "I wanted to let you know that the stakeholder analysis you completed was thorough and insightful. It's directly shaping our engagement strategy. Excellent work."

**Know your team members and tailor recognition to their preferences.**

**2. Peer Recognition**
Recognition from peers is often more meaningful than recognition from the project manager.

**Example – Expense System**: Sarah introduces a "kudos" practice in the sprint retrospective. Team members recognize each other:
- "Kudos to Developer 1 for helping me debug that API integration. Saved me hours."
- "Kudos to the QA team for catching that security issue before it reached production."

Peer recognition builds team cohesion and reinforces collaboration.

**3. Tangible vs. Intangible**
Recognition doesn't always require tangible rewards (gifts, bonuses). Often, intangible recognition (verbal acknowledgment, thank-you notes, public praise) is more meaningful.

**Example – Office Renovation**: Sarah sends a handwritten thank-you note to the HVAC contractor after they work overtime to recover from a delay: "Thank you for your dedication this week. Working late to get the system installed on time demonstrates professionalism and commitment. It's a pleasure working with your team."

The contractor frames the note in their office. The recognition cost Sarah $0 and 5 minutes but created lasting goodwill.

## Identifying and Addressing Performance Issues

Not all performance issues resolve themselves. The project manager must identify problems early and address them constructively.

### Early Warning Signs of Performance Issues

**1. Declining Quality**
Work quality decreases—more defects, less attention to detail, missed requirements.

**Example – Transformation Program**: Sarah notices that a team member's deliverables used to be polished and thorough but have recently been rushed and incomplete. This is a warning sign.

**2. Missed Commitments**
Deadlines are consistently missed without proactive communication.

**Example – Expense System**: A developer commits to completing a feature by the sprint end but misses the deadline for three consecutive sprints. This is a pattern, not a one-time issue.

**3. Disengagement**
Team member is quiet in meetings, doesn't volunteer for tasks, seems checked out.

**Example – Transformation Program**: A previously engaged team member stops participating in discussions, shows up late to meetings, and provides minimal input. This signals disengagement.

**4. Conflict with Team Members**
Increased friction, defensiveness, or poor collaboration.

**Example – Expense System**: A developer becomes defensive during code reviews, dismisses feedback, and criticizes others' work. This damages team cohesion.

### Addressing Performance Issues: The Coaching Conversation

When performance issues emerge, the project manager should have a coaching conversation—private, specific, and focused on understanding and improvement.

**Coaching Conversation Framework**:

**1. Describe the Observable Behavior**
State what you've observed without judgment.

"I've noticed that the last three sprint commitments were not completed by the sprint end."

**2. Ask for the Team Member's Perspective**
There may be legitimate reasons you're not aware of.

"What's causing this? Is there something I should know about?"

**3. Explore Root Causes**
Work together to understand the underlying issue.

**Possible root causes**:
- Skill gap (team member lacks capability)
- Workload (team member is overloaded)
- Unclear expectations (team member doesn't understand what's expected)
- Personal issues (health, family, burnout)
- Motivation (team member is disengaged)

**Example – Expense System**: Sarah has a coaching conversation with Developer 3, who's been missing sprint commitments:

**Sarah**: "I've noticed the last three sprints, your committed work wasn't completed by sprint end. What's going on?"

**Developer 3**: "Honestly, I've been struggling. The tasks I'm getting assigned are more complex than I expected, and I don't feel like I have enough experience with this technology stack. I've been working extra hours trying to catch up, but I'm still falling behind."

**Root cause identified**: Skill gap + overload.

**4. Collaboratively Develop a Plan**
Work together to create a performance improvement plan.

**Sarah**: "Thanks for being honest. Here's what I suggest:
- For the next two sprints, I'll pair you with Developer 1, who has deep experience with this tech stack. You'll learn while delivering.
- We'll reduce your sprint commitment by 30% to give you space to learn without the pressure.
- I'll arrange for you to attend a two-day training course on this technology.
- Let's check in weekly to see how it's going."

**Developer 3**: "That sounds really helpful. Thank you."

**5. Follow Up and Monitor**
Check in regularly to ensure the plan is working.

Over the next two sprints, Developer 3's performance improves—pairing with Developer 1 accelerates learning, and the reduced commitment relieves pressure. By Sprint 11, Developer 3 is back to full productivity.

### When Coaching Isn't Enough

Sometimes, despite coaching and support, performance doesn't improve. At that point, more formal action may be necessary:

**1. Formal Performance Improvement Plan (PIP)**
A documented plan with specific performance goals, timeline, and consequences.

**2. Reassignment**
Moving the team member to a different role better suited to their skills.

**3. Removal from the Team**
In extreme cases, removing the team member from the project (this typically requires HR and management involvement).

**Example – Transformation Program**: A workstream lead consistently underperforms despite coaching and support. Sarah documents the performance issues, develops a 60-day PIP with clear goals, and monitors progress.

After 30 days, performance has not improved. Sarah escalates to the program sponsor and HR. Together, they decide to reassign the workstream lead to a different role and bring in a replacement.

**This is the last resort, used only when other interventions have failed.**

## Sustaining Team Morale Through Project Phases

Team morale naturally fluctuates throughout the project lifecycle. Understanding these patterns helps the project manager proactively support the team.

### The Project Morale Curve

**Phase 1 – Honeymoon (Initiation)**
High energy, optimism, excitement. The team is enthusiastic about the new project.

**Phase 2 – Reality Check (Early Execution)**
Challenges emerge. The work is harder than expected. Morale dips as reality sets in.

**Phase 3 – Grind (Mid-Execution)**
The project feels endless. Progress is slow. Fatigue sets in. Morale reaches its lowest point.

**Phase 4 – Momentum (Late Execution)**
The end is in sight. Progress accelerates. Morale improves.

**Phase 5 – Completion (Closing)**
Relief and accomplishment. Morale is high, but the team is exhausted.

### Supporting the Team at Each Phase

**During the Honeymoon**: Set realistic expectations to prevent a harsh reality check later.

**During the Reality Check**: Normalize challenges. Reinforce purpose. Provide support.

**Example – Expense System**: In Sprint 3, the team hits unexpected technical challenges. Morale dips. Sarah normalizes this: "Every project has a phase where things are harder than expected. This is normal. You're learning a new technology stack, and that takes time. Let's focus on progress, not perfection."

**During the Grind**: Celebrate small wins. Break work into manageable chunks. Provide breaks.

**Example – Transformation Program**: In Phase 2 (months 4-7), the team is exhausted. Sarah schedules a mid-phase celebration: pizza lunch, recognition of accomplishments, and a half-day off. This provides a mental reset.

**During Momentum**: Maintain focus. Don't let quality slip in the rush to finish.

**Example – Office Renovation**: In the final weeks, contractors are rushing to meet the deadline. Sarah reinforces quality standards: "I know we're in the home stretch, but quality can't slip. Let's finish strong."

**During Completion**: Celebrate accomplishments. Conduct retrospectives. Provide closure.

**Example – Expense System**: At the end of the project, Sarah organizes a release celebration where the team demonstrates the completed system to stakeholders. Stakeholders provide positive feedback. The team feels proud of their accomplishment.

## Balancing Individual Performance and Team Cohesion

High-performing individuals drive results, but team cohesion creates sustainable success. The project manager must balance both.

### The Star Performer Dilemma

**Scenario – Expense System**: Developer 1 is the team's star performer—delivers twice as much as anyone else, writes excellent code, solves the hardest problems. But Developer 1 works in isolation, doesn't help others, and sometimes makes decisions unilaterally without consulting the team.

Developer 1's individual performance is excellent, but their behavior is undermining team cohesion.

**Sarah's approach**:
1. **Recognize the value**: "Your technical skills and productivity are exceptional. You're a huge asset to the team."
2. **Provide corrective feedback**: "I've noticed you tend to work in isolation. This limits knowledge sharing and creates silos. I'd like you to pair program more often and involve the team in design decisions."
3. **Set expectations**: "High performance isn't just about individual output—it's about elevating the whole team."

**Outcome**: Developer 1 initially resists but eventually embraces pairing and collaboration. Individual output decreases slightly, but team output increases significantly as knowledge spreads.

**Lesson**: Individual brilliance doesn't compensate for poor teamwork. The best performers make those around them better.

### Creating Team Cohesion

**1. Shared Goals**
Teams cohere around common objectives.

**Example – Expense System**: The team rallies around the sprint goal: "Deliver mobile approval functionality." Everyone contributes to achieving this shared goal.

**2. Collaboration Rituals**
Regular collaboration builds relationships.

**Example – Transformation Program**: Sarah establishes weekly cross-workstream working sessions where teams collaborate on integration challenges. These sessions build relationships and break down silos.

**3. Shared Identity**
Teams perform better when they have a shared identity.

**Example – Office Renovation**: The construction team adopts a shared identity: "We're the team that delivers quality work on time." This identity reinforces desired behaviors.

**4. Psychological Safety**
Teams cohere when members feel safe being vulnerable.

**Example – Expense System**: In retrospectives, team members openly discuss mistakes and challenges without fear of blame. This vulnerability builds trust.

## Servant Leadership During Execution

Execution is where servant leadership principles (Chapter 9) are truly tested. The project manager's role is to remove impediments and enable the team to perform.

### Removing Impediments

Impediments are obstacles that prevent the team from performing effectively. The servant leader's primary role is to remove them.

**Example – Expense System**: During daily standup, Developer 2 raises an impediment: "I need access to the production database to debug an issue, but IT hasn't granted me access despite three requests."

Sarah immediately takes action: "I'll follow up with IT today and get you access by this afternoon."

By end of day, access is granted. The impediment is removed.

**Types of impediments**:
- **Resource impediments**: Missing tools, access, or materials
- **Organizational impediments**: Bureaucracy, slow approvals, conflicting priorities
- **Technical impediments**: Technical debt, unclear requirements, integration issues
- **People impediments**: Conflicts, skill gaps, poor communication

**The servant leader's role is to clear these obstacles so the team can focus on delivering value.**

### Empowering the Team

Servant leaders empower teams to make decisions and take ownership.

**Example – Transformation Program**: The Change Management workstream wants to redesign the communication plan based on pilot feedback. Instead of dictating the approach, Sarah empowers the team:

"You're closest to the stakeholders and the feedback. What do you recommend?"

The team proposes a new approach. Sarah asks clarifying questions to ensure they've thought through the implications, then approves it: "Sounds good. You own this. Let me know if you need support."

**Empowerment builds ownership and develops team capability.**

### Shielding the Team from Distractions

Execution is chaotic. Stakeholders make requests, priorities shift, and distractions accumulate. The servant leader shields the team from this chaos.

**Example – Expense System**: Mid-sprint, a stakeholder emails the development team directly: "Can you add a quick feature to export expenses to Excel?"

The developers are uncertain—should they add this to the current sprint?

Sarah intervenes: "All feature requests go through the Product Owner and backlog prioritization process. I'll add this to the backlog and we'll evaluate it for a future sprint. For now, stay focused on the current sprint goal."

By shielding the team from ad-hoc requests, Sarah protects their focus and productivity.

## Key Takeaways: Team Performance and Accountability

1. **Motivation is driven by purpose, mastery, and autonomy**: Connect work to impact, create growth opportunities, and trust the team to determine how.

2. **Accountability requires clarity, agreement, visibility, and consequences**: Clear expectations, agreed commitments, visible progress, and follow-through.

3. **Feedback must be timely, specific, behavioral, and balanced**: Provide feedback close to the event, focus on observable behaviors, and balance reinforcing with corrective feedback.

4. **Address performance issues early through coaching conversations**: Explore root causes collaboratively and develop improvement plans together.

5. **Sustain morale throughout the project lifecycle**: Understand natural morale fluctuations and proactively support the team at each phase.

6. **Balance individual performance with team cohesion**: High performers should elevate the team, not work in isolation.

7. **Servant leadership drives execution success**: Remove impediments, empower the team, and shield them from distractions.

Sarah's team performance management across three projects demonstrates these principles:
- The Office Renovation's contractor coordination and recognition builds morale
- The Expense System's self-organizing team demonstrates high accountability
- The Transformation Program's coaching interventions improve workstream performance

Team performance is the heart of execution success. Master these principles, and your teams will deliver exceptional results while growing and thriving throughout the project.
