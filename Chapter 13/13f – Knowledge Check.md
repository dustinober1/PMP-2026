This Knowledge Check contains scenario-based practice questions covering the execution concepts from Chapter 13. These questions reflect the style and complexity of actual PMP exam questions—they test your ability to apply concepts in realistic project situations, not just recall definitions.

For each question:
1. Read the scenario carefully
2. Identify the core issue or decision point
3. Evaluate each option against PMI principles
4. Select the BEST answer (often multiple options are partially correct)
5. Review the explanation to understand the reasoning

**Question Types**:
- Coordination and team execution challenges
- Quality management and testing decisions
- Scope change evaluation and management
- Vendor performance and relationship issues
- Team motivation and accountability scenarios
- Integration questions combining multiple execution concepts

## Practice Questions

### Question 1: Coordination in Hybrid Context

You are managing a program using a hybrid approach. The program has three workstreams: one using predictive methodology, one using Scrum, and one using Kanban. Stakeholders are confused by the different status reports and metrics each workstream provides. The predictive team reports earned value and schedule variance. The Scrum team reports velocity and burndown. The Kanban team reports cycle time and throughput.

What should you do FIRST?

A) Mandate that all workstreams use the same methodology so reporting is consistent

B) Create a unified program dashboard that translates each workstream's metrics into common progress indicators

C) Provide training to stakeholders on how to interpret different agile and predictive metrics

D) Continue with the current approach, as different methodologies require different metrics

**Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

**Why B is correct**: PMI's hybrid approach recognizes that different types of work may require different methodologies, but program-level reporting should provide a unified view that stakeholders can understand. Creating a unified dashboard that translates workstream-specific metrics (velocity, earned value, cycle time) into common program-level indicators (% complete, on track/at risk status, value delivered) allows each workstream to use appropriate methods while providing coherent program-level visibility. This is servant leadership—the program manager adapts to serve both the teams (let them use appropriate methods) and stakeholders (provide understandable reporting).

**Why A is incorrect**: Mandating a single methodology ignores the principle of tailoring—different types of work benefit from different approaches. Forcing the Scrum team to report earned value or the predictive team to report velocity would be inappropriate and reduce effectiveness.

**Why C is incorrect**: While stakeholder education is valuable, it treats the symptom (stakeholder confusion) rather than the root cause (lack of integrated reporting). Training stakeholders to interpret three different metric systems is burdensome and doesn't solve the coordination challenge.

**Why D is incorrect**: "Continue with current approach" ignores the stakeholder confusion, which will lead to disengagement and poor decision-making. The program manager has a responsibility to make program progress visible and understandable.

**Key Concept**: Hybrid coordination requires integration at the program level while allowing appropriate diversity at the team level.

### Question 2: Quality Gate Failure

You are managing a predictive construction project. At a critical quality gate (framing inspection), the building inspector identifies structural issues that don't meet code. Correcting the issues will cost $8,000 and delay the project by one week. The general contractor suggests hiding the issues behind drywall and hoping the final inspector doesn't notice.

What should you do?

A) Accept the contractor's suggestion to avoid cost and schedule impacts

B) Require the contractor to fix the issues immediately, even though it causes cost and schedule impacts

C) Negotiate with the building inspector to approve a variance that allows lesser structural standards

D) Request a second opinion from another inspector to see if the first inspector is being too strict

**Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

**Why B is correct**: Quality and safety issues, especially those involving building codes and regulations, are non-negotiable. PMI's professional responsibility and ethics standards require that project managers never compromise on safety, compliance, or legal requirements. The cost ($8,000) and schedule (one week) impacts are painful but far less than the consequences of a structural failure, legal liability, or having to demolish and rebuild after the issue is discovered during final inspection. The contractor is contractually obligated to meet code, so they bear the cost of corrections under a fixed-price contract.

**Why A is incorrect**: This is unethical and illegal. Hiding non-compliant work violates building codes, exposes the project to massive liability, and violates PMI's Code of Ethics. If the issue is discovered later (during final inspection or after occupancy), the consequences would be far worse—demolition, reconstruction, legal action, safety risks.

**Why C is incorrect**: Structural code requirements exist for safety reasons. Negotiating a variance to accept lesser safety standards is inappropriate and unlikely to be approved. Even if approved, it exposes building occupants to safety risks.

**Why D is incorrect**: This is delay tactic hoping for a different answer, which is not appropriate when a legitimate code violation has been identified. Inspector shopping undermines the integrity of the inspection process. If the first inspector identified a real code violation, a second inspector should reach the same conclusion.

**Key Concept**: Quality and compliance are non-negotiable. Cost and schedule impacts are acceptable when necessary to meet safety and legal standards.

### Question 3: Scope Creep in Agile

You are the project manager for an agile software development project. During Sprint 6, a key stakeholder approaches the development team directly and requests adding a new feature to the current sprint. The team wants to accommodate the stakeholder and begins working on the feature without consulting you or the Product Owner. This is the third time this has happened.

What should you do?

A) Allow the team to continue working on the feature since the stakeholder requested it

B) Remove the feature from the sprint and coach the team on the importance of protecting the sprint commitment

C) Escalate the stakeholder's behavior to their manager for bypassing the proper request process

D) Add the feature to the sprint but remove an equivalent amount of work to maintain sprint capacity

**Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

**Why B is correct**: In agile, the sprint commitment is a contract between the team and the Product Owner. Once a sprint starts, scope should remain stable to protect focus and flow. Ad-hoc stakeholder requests during the sprint undermine this stability. The correct process is: stakeholder requests go to the Product Owner → Product Owner adds to backlog → Product Owner prioritizes for future sprints. By removing the feature and coaching the team, you're reinforcing the proper process and protecting the team from thrashing. This is also a teaching moment—the team needs to understand that responding to every stakeholder request, even well-intentioned, creates chaos.

**Why A is incorrect**: Allowing the team to continue rewards the wrong behavior (bypassing process) and perpetuates the pattern. The team will continue accepting ad-hoc requests, undermining sprint stability.

**Why C is incorrect**: Escalating to the stakeholder's manager is premature and potentially damages the relationship. The issue isn't the stakeholder making requests (that's normal), it's the team accepting them mid-sprint without proper process. Address the team's behavior first.

**Why D is incorrect**: While this maintains sprint capacity, it still rewards bypassing the process and doesn't address the root cause. The Product Owner should make priority trade-offs, not the team responding to whoever asks most recently.

**Key Concept**: Agile welcomes change, but change goes through the backlog and prioritization process. Sprint commitments are protected to maintain focus.

### Question 4: Vendor Performance Issue

You are managing a project with a key vendor operating under a cost-plus-fixed-fee (CPFF) contract. You notice that the vendor is billing for more hours than seems reasonable for the work being produced. When you question this, the vendor explains that they've had to deal with unexpected complexity and learning curve issues.

What is the BEST way to address this?

A) Accept the explanation, as CPFF contracts reimburse actual costs regardless of efficiency

B) Request detailed time logs and work products to verify that billed hours align with value delivered

C) Switch to a fixed-price contract to incentivize the vendor to be more efficient

D) Terminate the vendor immediately for overbilling

**Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

**Why B is correct**: Under a CPFF contract, the project pays actual costs, but this doesn't mean the project manager should accept all costs without scrutiny. Requesting detailed time logs and work products allows verification that billed hours are legitimate and value-adding. This is partnership-based (assuming good faith while verifying) and protects the project from waste or abuse. If the vendor's explanation is legitimate (unexpected complexity, learning curve), the documentation will support it. If hours are inflated or non-value-adding, the documentation will reveal it, allowing corrective action.

**Why A is incorrect**: While CPFF contracts do reimburse actual costs, the project manager has a fiduciary responsibility to ensure costs are reasonable and necessary. Blindly accepting all costs without verification is poor stewardship.

**Why C is incorrect**: You can't unilaterally change contract type mid-project. Contract changes require mutual agreement and formal amendment. Additionally, switching contract types doesn't address the immediate concern about current billing.

**Why D is incorrect**: Termination is an extreme measure reserved for serious contract breaches or persistent poor performance. The current situation warrants investigation and potential corrective action, not immediate termination.

**Key Concept**: Cost-reimbursable contracts require active cost monitoring. Trust but verify.

### Question 5: Team Motivation During the Grind

Your project is in month 5 of a planned 9-month effort. Team morale is declining—velocity has dropped, team members seem disengaged in meetings, and two team members have requested to be moved to other projects. The work itself hasn't changed; the team is simply experiencing mid-project fatigue.

What should you do FIRST?

A) Replace the disengaged team members with fresh resources who have higher energy

B) Reduce the project scope to shorten the timeline and reduce team fatigue

C) Meet with the team to understand their concerns and identify ways to re-energize and support them

D) Increase extrinsic motivators such as bonuses or rewards to boost engagement

**Answer: C**

**Explanation:**

**Why C is correct**: Servant leadership principle—when the team is struggling, the first step is to understand their perspective and collaborate on solutions. Meeting with the team allows you to: (1) understand root causes of disengagement (burnout, unclear purpose, lack of growth, interpersonal conflicts?), (2) demonstrate that you value their perspective, (3) collaboratively develop solutions that address root causes. This might include celebrating small wins, providing growth opportunities, taking a team break, or adjusting work processes. By involving the team in the solution, you rebuild engagement and ownership.

**Why A is incorrect**: Replacing team members treats them as interchangeable resources and doesn't address root causes. It also damages morale for remaining team members ("if we're not engaged, we'll be replaced"). Mid-project team changes disrupt knowledge and relationships. Additionally, this may not even be feasible.

**Why B is incorrect**: Reducing scope might help timeline, but the root cause of disengagement may not be the timeline—it could be lack of purpose, monotonous work, interpersonal issues, etc. Jumping to scope reduction without understanding root causes wastes a valuable opportunity to address the real issue.

**Why D is incorrect**: Extrinsic motivators provide short-term boosts but don't address root causes of disengagement. Research shows intrinsic motivation (purpose, mastery, autonomy) is more sustainable. Bonuses might temporarily increase energy, but if the root cause (e.g., lack of purpose or growth) isn't addressed, disengagement will return.

**Key Concept**: Address team performance issues by first seeking to understand, then collaborating on solutions. Servant leadership builds engagement.

### Question 6: Integration Quality Issue

You are managing a program with three workstreams (Technology, Process, and Training). Each workstream has delivered high-quality individual deliverables. However, during integration testing, you discover that the Training materials describe a process that the Technology system doesn't support. This indicates an integration failure despite each workstream meeting their individual quality standards.

What is the root cause of this issue?

A) The Training workstream didn't properly review the Technology specifications

B) The Technology workstream didn't properly implement the required features

C) Insufficient integration coordination and validation across workstreams

D) The Process workstream failed to communicate requirements clearly

**Answer: C**

**Explanation:**

**Why C is correct**: This is a classic integration failure. Each workstream delivered quality work *in isolation*, but they weren't properly coordinated. The root cause is lack of integration validation—there should have been cross-workstream reviews during development (not just at integration testing) to ensure alignment. In a well-coordinated program, the Training, Process, and Technology teams would have joint working sessions to ensure training describes what the system actually does, which reflects what the process actually requires. The program manager is responsible for creating these integration points.

**Why A is incorrect**: This assigns blame to the Training team, which is not useful and may not be accurate. The Training team may have reviewed specifications, but if those specifications were outdated or the Technology implementation changed, the training would be misaligned. The root cause is the lack of ongoing integration validation, not one team's failure to review.

**Why B is incorrect**: There's no evidence the Technology team failed to implement—they may have implemented exactly what was specified, but that specification didn't match what Training described. Again, this assigns blame rather than addressing the systemic coordination gap.

**Why D is incorrect**: Similar to A and B, this assigns blame without addressing the systemic issue. The Process team may have communicated clearly, but if Technology and Training weren't coordinated with those requirements, misalignment results.

**Key Concept**: In programs, integration quality is as important as component quality. Integration requires ongoing coordination, not just end-phase testing.

### Question 7: Change Request Evaluation

You are managing a predictive project. A stakeholder submits a change request to add a new feature. Your analysis shows:
- Value: Moderate (nice-to-have improvement)
- Cost: $12,000
- Schedule impact: 2-week delay
- Risk: Low

The project is currently on schedule and on budget, but there is no schedule or budget buffer. The stakeholder argues that the feature will significantly improve user satisfaction.

What should you do?

A) Approve the change request since it's low risk and will improve user satisfaction

B) Reject the change request because there is no budget or schedule buffer to absorb it

C) Present the change request to the sponsor/CCB with options: approve with budget/schedule increase, defer to a future phase, or reject

D) Approve the change but compress the schedule elsewhere to avoid the 2-week delay

**Answer: C**

**Explanation:**

**Why C is correct**: Change requests that impact budget or schedule beyond the project manager's authority should be escalated to the appropriate decision-maker (sponsor or Change Control Board). The project manager's role is to analyze the change (which you've done), present options with trade-offs, and recommend a course of action. The decision should be made by those with budget/schedule authority and business perspective. Presenting options (approve with impacts, defer to Phase 2, reject) allows stakeholders to make an informed decision based on business priorities.

**Why A is incorrect**: Approving a change that adds $12,000 cost and 2-week delay without budget/schedule buffer and without sponsor approval exceeds the project manager's authority (unless explicitly delegated). Even if the value justifies it, the decision should involve those who own budget and schedule commitments.

**Why B is incorrect**: Rejecting the change unilaterally may be appropriate if it's clearly low-value or outside scope, but this change has moderate value and the stakeholder believes it significantly improves satisfaction. The project manager should facilitate the decision, not make it unilaterally.

**Why D is incorrect**: Schedule compression (crashing or fast-tracking) often introduces additional risk, cost, or quality trade-offs. Approving the change and committing to schedule compression without analyzing those trade-offs or getting sponsor approval is risky. The decision to compress should be made transparently with stakeholder input.

**Key Concept**: Significant change requests should be escalated with analysis, options, and recommendations. The project manager facilitates decisions; stakeholders with authority make them.

### Question 8: Daily Standup Issues

You are the Scrum Master for an agile project. You notice that the daily standup has devolved into a status report to you—each team member robotically answers the three questions (what I did, what I'll do, blockers) while looking at you, then immediately returns to their desk. There's no team interaction, no problem-solving, and no energy.

What should you do?

A) Cancel the daily standup since it's not adding value

B) Change the format—have team members update a digital board asynchronously instead of meeting

C) Facilitate a retrospective discussion with the team about how to make standups more valuable

D) Require team members to face each other during standup instead of facing you

**Answer: C**

**Explanation:**

**Why C is correct**: The daily standup is designed to foster team coordination and self-organization, not to report status to the project manager. The current dysfunction suggests the team doesn't understand the purpose or hasn't developed effective standup practices. A retrospective discussion allows the team to: (1) reflect on what's not working (standup feels like performance theater), (2) understand the intended purpose (team coordination, problem-solving, mutual support), (3) collaboratively redesign the standup to be more valuable (e.g., stand around the board, focus on blockers and collaboration opportunities, keep it time-boxed). This servant leadership approach empowers the team to improve their own process.

**Why A is incorrect**: Cancelling the standup eliminates a valuable coordination mechanism. The problem isn't the standup itself—it's how the team is conducting it. Fix the dysfunction, don't eliminate the practice.

**Why B is incorrect**: Asynchronous updates might work for some teams, but it doesn't address the core issue—lack of team interaction and coordination. Moving to async updates might make the problem worse by further reducing face-to-face interaction.

**Why D is incorrect**: While this might help (orienting toward each other rather than the PM can shift the dynamic), it's a superficial fix that doesn't address root causes. The team needs to understand why they're doing standups and how to make them valuable, not just change their physical orientation.

**Key Concept**: Agile ceremonies should drive value. When they become theater, retrospect and improve them collaboratively.

### Question 9: Vendor Dependency Delay

You are managing a project with two vendors. Vendor A is responsible for delivering a critical component by March 15, which Vendor B needs to integrate into their deliverable by April 1. Vendor A notifies you on March 10 that they will be one week late (delivering March 22 instead of March 15) due to supply chain issues beyond their control.

What should you do FIRST?

A) Invoke the contract's liquidated damages clause to penalize Vendor A for the delay

B) Immediately notify Vendor B of the delay and work with them to assess impact and adjust plans

C) Request that Vendor A expedite delivery by working overtime or adding resources

D) Escalate the delay to your project sponsor before taking any action

**Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

**Why B is correct**: When one vendor's delay impacts a dependent vendor, the first priority is coordination—notify the impacted vendor (Vendor B) immediately so they can assess impact and adjust plans. Vendor B may be able to absorb the one-week delay through float in their schedule, or they may need to adjust their plan. Early notification gives Vendor B maximum time to respond and minimizes downstream impacts. This is proactive dependency management.

**Why A is incorrect**: Invoking penalties is premature and potentially damages the relationship. Vendor A's delay is caused by supply chain issues (likely force majeure under most contracts), which typically excuses performance. Even if damages are contractually justified, the first priority is mitigating project impact, not punishing the vendor.

**Why C is incorrect**: Requesting expedited delivery might be valuable *after* understanding Vendor B's flexibility. But it's not the first step. Vendor B might have float that absorbs the delay, making expedition unnecessary. Or expedition might be impossible due to supply chain constraints. Coordinate first, then explore recovery options.

**Why D is incorrect**: Escalating to the sponsor might be necessary eventually, but the project manager should first assess the impact and explore mitigation options. Escalating immediately without information or proposed solutions is premature.

**Key Concept**: When vendor dependencies are impacted, immediately coordinate with affected parties to assess impact and develop mitigation plans.

### Question 10: Scope Validation Failure

You are managing a predictive project. At the final deliverable acceptance review, the stakeholder rejects the deliverable, stating: "This isn't what I expected. I wanted X, but you delivered Y." You review the requirements document, which clearly specifies Y. The stakeholder signed off on the requirements six months ago.

What is the MOST LIKELY root cause?

A) The stakeholder didn't carefully review the requirements document when they signed off

B) The requirements were ambiguous or unclear, leading to different interpretations

C) Insufficient stakeholder engagement and validation during execution led to expectation gaps

D) The project team didn't implement the requirements correctly

**Answer: C**

**Explanation:**

**Why C is correct**: This is a classic case of insufficient progressive elaboration and stakeholder validation during execution. Even though the requirements were documented and signed off, six months passed between requirements sign-off and deliverable review. During that time, stakeholder expectations may have evolved, or the stakeholder may have developed a clearer mental model of what they wanted. If the project team had conducted interim reviews, demos, or validation sessions during development, this expectation gap would have been discovered and corrected early. PMI's approach emphasizes continuous stakeholder engagement and iterative validation, even in predictive projects.

**Why A is incorrect**: While this might be partially true, it's not actionable and it assigns blame. Even if the stakeholder didn't carefully review initially, the project manager has a responsibility to ensure shared understanding and continuous validation.

**Why B is incorrect**: The scenario states the requirements "clearly specify Y," suggesting they weren't ambiguous. Even if they were ambiguous, the root cause is still lack of validation during execution—ambiguity would have been discovered during interim reviews.

**Why D is incorrect**: There's no evidence the team implemented incorrectly—they delivered Y, which matches the documented requirements. The gap is between the documented requirements and stakeholder expectations.

**Key Concept**: Scope validation should happen continuously throughout execution, not just at final delivery. Frequent stakeholder engagement prevents expectation gaps.

### Question 11: Performance Coaching

One of your team members has been consistently underperforming—missing deadlines, delivering incomplete work, and disengaged in team meetings. You have a coaching conversation and discover that the team member feels overwhelmed, lacks confidence in their technical skills, and is afraid to ask for help.

What should you do?

A) Reassign the team member to a less critical role where their skill gaps won't impact the project

B) Develop a performance improvement plan with specific goals, support (pairing, training), and regular check-ins

C) Remove the team member from the project to prevent further delays

D) Assign all their work to other team members who are more capable

**Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

**Why B is correct**: The coaching conversation revealed root causes: skill gap, overwhelm, and fear of asking for help. These are addressable through support and development. A performance improvement plan that includes pairing with experienced team members, training, reduced workload (temporarily), and regular check-ins provides the support needed to succeed while establishing clear performance expectations. This is servant leadership—investing in the team member's development rather than giving up on them. Many high-performers have gone through periods of struggle and emerged stronger with proper support.

**Why A is incorrect**: Reassignment might be necessary if support doesn't work, but it's premature as a first step. The team member hasn't been given an opportunity to improve with support. Reassignment may also damage their confidence and career development.

**Why C is incorrect**: Removal is the last resort, used only when support and coaching have failed. Removing a team member who hasn't been given support to improve is premature and potentially unjust.

**Why D is incorrect**: This creates resentment (other team members are now overloaded), doesn't develop the struggling team member's skills, and may not even be feasible. It also signals to the team that struggling members will be sidelined rather than supported, which damages psychological safety.

**Key Concept**: Address performance issues through coaching and support before resorting to reassignment or removal. Invest in team member development.

### Question 12: Integration Question – Quality and Scope

You are nearing the end of a sprint when the QA team discovers a critical defect in a feature that was supposed to be completed this sprint. Fixing the defect will take two days, which means the sprint goal will not be fully met. The Product Owner suggests deferring the defect fix to the next sprint so the team can demonstrate the feature (with the known defect) in the sprint review.

What should you do?

A) Agree with the Product Owner—demonstrate the feature with the known defect and fix it in the next sprint

B) Fix the defect immediately, even if it means not meeting the sprint goal, because the definition of "Done" includes no known defects

C) Demonstrate the feature with a disclaimer about the known defect, then decide in the sprint review whether to accept or defer

D) Cancel the sprint and restart with a revised goal that accounts for the defect fix

**Answer: B**

**Explanation:**

**Why B is correct**: The Definition of Done (DoD) is a quality contract that defines when work is truly complete. If the DoD includes "no known defects" (which is standard in agile), then a feature with a known critical defect is not Done, even if it looks complete. Demonstrating incomplete work violates the integrity of the DoD and creates technical debt. The right approach is to fix the defect, mark the feature as incomplete, and carry it to the next sprint if necessary. Sprint goals are important, but quality standards are non-negotiable. This also relates to scope management—the feature isn't in scope for this sprint if it doesn't meet the DoD.

**Why A is incorrect**: This compromises quality standards and creates technical debt. Deferring defect fixes is how technical debt accumulates and quality degrades over time. PMI's quality management approach emphasizes building quality in, not deferring fixes.

**Why C is incorrect**: This is a compromise that might seem pragmatic, but it still presents incomplete work as Done. The sprint review should demonstrate working, production-ready functionality, not known-defective functionality. Making the decision in the sprint review places the Product Owner in an awkward position of choosing between quality and perceived progress.

**Why D is incorrect**: Cancelling the sprint is extreme and unnecessary. The sprint can continue—the team just acknowledges that this particular feature won't be complete this sprint. The team can work on other backlog items or get a head start on next sprint's work while fixing the defect.

**Key Concept**: Quality standards (Definition of Done) are non-negotiable. Don't compromise quality to create the appearance of progress.
