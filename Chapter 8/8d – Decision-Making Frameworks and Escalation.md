# 8d – Decision-Making Frameworks and Escalation

Sarah makes a critical realization: **A bad decision made quickly is better than a perfect decision made too late.**

By month six, Sarah had learned to resolve conflicts through dialogue and negotiation. But she noticed something: sometimes people kept discussing the same issue multiple times because there was no clear framework for *making the decision*.

In the transformation program, the design team kept revisiting whether the new process should require manager approval for every action or manager approval only for exceptions. They had discussed it five times. People had opinions. But there was no process for deciding.

Sarah learned to ask: **"How should we make this decision? Who needs to be involved? What information do we need?"**

This section teaches you to **choose the right decision-making approach for each situation** and know when you have discussed enough and need to decide.

## 8.1 Decision-Making Models

Different situations call for different decision-making approaches:

### 8.1.1 Autocratic (You Decide Alone)

**What it is**: You gather input, then make the decision yourself without consensus.

**How it works**:
- You gather information and perspectives
- You consider input from others
- You make the decision alone
- You communicate the decision and move forward

**When to use it**:
- **Time is critical**: "We need to decide now. I am making the call."
- **You have significantly more information or authority**: "I have the information needed. Others cannot weigh in meaningfully."
- **The decision is reversible**: "If this does not work, we can change course."
- **People expect you to decide**: "The sponsor delegated this decision to me."
- **After consultation, you have heard all perspectives**: "I have talked to everyone. I understand the trade-offs. Now I am deciding."

**When NOT to use it**:
- When people's buy-in is essential (they will execute better if they felt heard)
- When the decision is irreversible
- When multiple people have equal authority (peer situation)

**Risks**:
- People may feel unheard if you did not genuinely listen before deciding
- They may not commit fully if they disagreed with the decision
- You may miss important information if you did not listen well

**Sarah's example**:
When the fire safety issue emerged, Sarah made the decision alone: "We cannot use a layout that blocks the fire exit. Period." She listened to alternatives but made the final call because safety was non-negotiable and within her authority.

### 8.1.2 Consultative (You Gather Input, Then Decide)

**What it is**: You actively gather input from relevant people, then you decide. People know you might not follow their advice.

**How it works**:
1. You identify whose input matters
2. You ask for their perspective
3. You genuinely listen
4. You decide (which may or may not align with input)
5. You explain your reasoning
6. You move forward

**When to use it**:
- **You need perspectives but retain decision authority**: "I want your input. I may not follow it, but I want to understand your view."
- **Time is limited**: "We need to decide soon. I am gathering input, then deciding."
- **Not everyone needs to be consulted**: "This is important to some people, but not everyone."
- **The decision affects people who should have voice but not veto**: "You will be affected, so I want your perspective."

**When NOT to use it**:
- When you want consensus or full buy-in
- When people expect to be involved in the decision
- When the decision requires peer agreement (everyone has equal say)

**Risks**:
- People who gave input may feel dismissed if you did not follow it
- To mitigate, explain your reasoning for your decision

**Sarah's example**:
For the renovation timeline, Sarah consulted the General Contractor, Facilities Manager, and Finance Director. She heard their concerns. Then she recommended a phased approach to the CFO. She said: "I heard that timeline matters, that quality matters, and that budget matters. Here is how we address all three: [phased approach]. That is my recommendation." The CFO approved it.

### 8.1.3 Consensus (Everyone Agrees)

**What it is**: You discuss until everyone genuinely agrees (not just accepts, but agrees).

**How it works**:
1. Present the issue and options
2. Discuss until people understand each other's concerns
3. Look for creative solutions that address multiple concerns
4. Keep discussing until you find something everyone can agree on
5. Decide together

**When to use it**:
- **Buy-in is critical**: "Everyone has to believe in this, not just comply."
- **The decision affects everyone equally**: "You all have to live with this decision."
- **Time is available**: "This is important enough to spend time on."
- **People have equal authority**: "None of us can override the others."
- **The decision sets precedent or values**: "This reflects what we believe as a team."

**When NOT to use it**:
- When time is limited
- When not everyone's agreement is essential
- When one person has clear authority to decide

**Risks**:
- Takes a long time
- One person can block if they refuse to agree
- Requires people to be willing to find common ground
- May result in compromise that no one loves

**How to make consensus work**:
- Be willing to adapt your position if you hear something important
- Look for creative solutions that address multiple concerns
- Know when you have done enough discussing (move to decision)
- If true consensus is impossible, escalate: "I want consensus, but if we cannot find it, the decision-maker will choose"

**Sarah's example**:
For the architect-agile coach conflict, Sarah facilitated consensus. She said: "I want us to find an approach that you both can genuinely support. Let's understand what matters most to each of you, then see if we can find a way to address both." After discussion, they found the hybrid approach they all supported.

### 8.1.4 Democratic (Majority Vote)

**What it is**: Multiple people vote, and the majority decision wins.

**How it works**:
1. Present options
2. People vote
3. Majority wins
4. Everyone commits to the decision, even if they voted differently

**When to use it**:
- **Multiple options exist and people have equal authority**: "We need to choose between option A, B, or C. Everyone gets a vote."
- **Time is limited and consensus is impossible**: "We cannot discuss forever. Let's vote."
- **You want all voices heard equally**: "Everyone's perspective counts equally."

**When NOT to use it**:
- When one person has clear authority to decide (they are the decision-maker, not voters)
- When consensus is possible and important
- When the decision is reversible and needs reconsideration

**Risks**:
- People who voted for the losing option may resent the decision
- It can feel unfair if the majority is small (51% vs 49%)
- Does not work well for complex decisions with nuance

**Sarah's example**:
Sarah did not use voting much. Most decisions in projects have someone with clear authority (the sponsor, the PM), not equal authority.

### 8.1.5 Delegation (Someone Else Decides)

**What it is**: You empower someone else to make the decision on behalf of the group.

**How it works**:
1. You identify a decision-maker
2. You give them the authority to decide
3. They gather input and decide
4. Everyone commits to their decision

**When to use it**:
- **Someone has clear authority**: "The architect decides the technical approach. That is their domain."
- **You want to develop someone**: "I am empowering you to make this decision. This is your call."
- **The decision is in their area of expertise**: "You know this better than I do. You decide."
- **You are overloaded**: "I am delegating this decision to you so I can focus on other priorities."

**When NOT to use it**:
- When you are supposed to decide
- When the decision requires coordination across domains
- When the delegated person is not ready

**Risks**:
- If you delegate without clear authority, the decision may not stick
- If you delegate the wrong person's authority, there may be conflict later
- You give up control over the decision

**Sarah's example**:
Sarah delegated technical architecture decisions to the Technical Architect. She said: "This is your domain. You have the authority to make the technical call. I will support your decision." This freed Sarah from being in every technical debate and empowered the architect.

## 8.2 The Decision Tree: When to Use Which Model

Use this framework to choose the right decision-making approach:

**Step 1: How much time do you have?**
- **Limited time** (hours/days): Use Autocratic or Consultative
- **Moderate time** (days/weeks): Use Consultative or Consensus
- **Plenty of time**: Use Consensus or Democratic

**Step 2: How critical is buy-in?**
- **Low importance**: Autocratic
- **Moderate importance**: Consultative
- **Critical importance**: Consensus or Democratic

**Step 3: Is there clear decision authority?**
- **Yes, you have authority**: Autocratic, Consultative, or Delegation
- **No, it is a peer situation**: Consensus, Democratic, or Collaborative Autocratic
- **Multiple decision-makers**: Consensus or Democratic

**Step 4: Do people have equal expertise/information?**
- **You have significantly more information**: Autocratic (after listening)
- **Information is distributed**: Consultative or Consensus
- **Someone has domain expertise**: Delegate to them

**Step 5: Is the decision reversible?**
- **Reversible**: Autocratic is fine; you can change course
- **Hard to reverse**: Use Consultative or Consensus to get it right the first time
- **Irreversible**: Use Consensus or involve decision-maker; be very thoughtful

**Example Decision Tree**:

| Time | Buy-In | Authority | Approach |
|---|---|---|---|
| Hours | Low | You | Autocratic |
| Days | Moderate | You | Consultative |
| Days | High | You | Consultative + Consensus discussion |
| Weeks | High | Peer | Consensus |
| Hours | High | Peer | Collaborative Autocratic (you facilitate, but acknowledge you might decide differently) |

## 8.3 Making Decisions With Incomplete Information

Sarah realizes that **you rarely have perfect information. You have to decide anyway.**

**Framework for deciding with incomplete info**:

**Step 1: Identify what you do not know**
- "We do not have technical proof that this approach will work"
- "We do not know if the budget will be approved"
- "We do not know how customers will react"

**Step 2: Assess the risk of waiting vs. deciding**
- Cost of deciding without full info vs. cost of waiting for more info
- "If we wait 2 weeks for market research, can we still launch in Q2?"
- "If we go with this approach and it is wrong, can we pivot?"

**Step 3: Make the best decision with available information**
- "Based on what we know, this is the best option"
- "Our assumptions are X, Y, and Z. If those prove wrong, we will revisit"

**Step 4: Plan for learning**
- "We will test this in month 1 with a small group"
- "We will measure these metrics to see if our assumptions are right"
- "We will revisit this decision in 3 months"

**Step 5: Decide and move forward**
- Do not second-guess the decision
- Execute and learn
- Adjust if the learning changes your understanding

**Sarah's example**:
For the transformation program, the design team did not have perfect information about whether the new process would work across all regions. But they had to design something. So Sarah said:
- "Design based on what we know about the regions. Make assumptions about the differences."
- "Propose a design that works for HQ (where we have the most info)."
- "In the pilot phase, we will test and learn. If the process needs regional adaptation, we will adjust."

This approach let the team move forward without waiting for perfect information.

## 8.4 Reversible vs. Irreversible Decisions

Not all decisions are created equal.

**Reversible decisions** (can be changed later):
- Technology choices (often)
- Process implementations (often)
- Team assignments
- Communication approaches
- Features included in early releases

For reversible decisions: **Make them quickly. Decide with available information. Adjust if needed.**

**Irreversible or hard-to-reverse decisions**:
- Major scope decisions (cutting features)
- Organizational structure changes
- Long-term contracts
- Decisions that set precedent (which will be hard to change)
- Decisions that affect trust or reputation

For irreversible decisions: **Invest time in getting it right. Use consensus or involve decision-maker. Plan thoughtfully. Be very sure.**

**Sarah's example**:
Sarah treated the technical architecture decision (reversible) differently from the organizational structure decision for the transformation (irreversible). For architecture, she let the architect decide quickly. For organization, she spent weeks in discussion before the steering committee decided.

## 8.5 When to Escalate

Sometimes you cannot or should not make the decision. You need to escalate.

**When to escalate**:
- **It exceeds your authority**: "This decision requires CFO approval. I am escalating."
- **It affects multiple domains**: "This decision touches technical, operational, and business. The steering committee should decide."
- **Stakeholders cannot agree**: "We have tried consensus and compromise. This requires higher-level decision-making authority."
- **It sets precedent**: "This is a precedent-setting decision. Leadership should decide."
- **You do not have enough information**: "I do not have the information to decide. The data team should analyze and recommend."
- **It is outside your expertise**: "This requires financial analysis. I am escalating to Finance."

**How to escalate effectively**:

**Step 1: Try to resolve at your level first**
- Do not escalate too early or people will lose confidence in your decision-making
- Show that you tried to resolve it
- Have a clear reason for escalating (not just "I could not decide")

**Step 2: Present the issue clearly**
- State what the decision is
- Explain why it matters
- Describe perspectives and trade-offs

**Step 3: Provide a recommendation** (if appropriate)
- "Based on [reasoning], I recommend [option]"
- Or, if you genuinely cannot recommend: "I see the trade-offs. Both options are viable. This is your call to make."

**Step 4: Request a timeline**
- "I need this decision by [date] so we can move forward"
- Give them context on urgency

**Step 5: Once decided, support the decision**
- Even if you recommended differently, support what was decided
- Do not undermine the decision with your team

**Sarah's example**:
When Finance and Architecture disagreed on the technical approach for the expense system, Sarah escalated to the CTO. She said:
- "Here is the decision: technical approach for the system"
- "Finance recommends option A (cheaper, faster). Architecture recommends option B (more scalable). Both are viable."
- "Here is what we gain with option A [list]. Here is what we gain with option B [list]."
- "I need a decision by Friday so we can start architecture planning."

The CTO decided on a hybrid. Sarah supported that decision with her team, even though she had been leaning toward Finance's perspective.

## 8.6 Decision Quality and Implementation

Sarah learns that **a good decision that is not implemented is worse than a mediocre decision that is fully executed.**

**For each decision, ensure**:
1. **Clarity**: Everyone understands what was decided (not different interpretations)
2. **Why**: People understand the reasoning (so they can explain it to others)
3. **Next steps**: Clear actions and owners
4. **Timeline**: When this takes effect
5. **Trade-offs acknowledged**: People understand what was given up (so they do not feel misled later)
6. **Communication**: Not just announced, but understood at all levels

**Example**:
When the transformation program decided on a phased approach with regional adaptation, Sarah did not just announce it. She:
- Explained the decision: "We are doing a phased regional approach"
- Explained the reasoning: "This balances standardization and regional flexibility"
- Explained trade-offs: "We are giving up some consistency to gain regional adoption"
- Showed how it works: "Here is what is standard. Here is what is flexible."
- Got regional director input on which decisions to make regionally
- Created a detailed implementation plan

This ensured the decision stuck and people implemented it well.

## Key Takeaways: Decision-Making and Escalation

1. **Match decision-making approach to the situation**: Autocratic, Consultative, Consensus, Democratic, Delegation
2. **Clarify decision authority before deciding**: Who gets to decide?
3. **Time and buy-in are key factors**: Trade-off between speed and commitment
4. **You rarely have perfect information**: Decide with available info and plan to learn
5. **Some decisions are reversible; some are not**: Invest more time in irreversible decisions
6. **Escalate when necessary**: But try to resolve at your level first
7. **Good decisions require good communication**: People need to understand and commit
8. **Implement decisively**: Once decided, move forward confidently
9. **Know when to stop discussing**: At some point, you have heard enough and need to decide
10. **Be willing to revisit**: If you learn the decision was wrong, revisit it (for reversible decisions)

## Practice Scenario

**Context**: Your project has a critical dependency on a third-party API. You have three options:
1. **Build integration with existing public API** (free, but less functionality, unstable)
2. **Buy the vendor's premium API** ($50K/year, fully supported, but requires budget approval)
3. **Build your own API** (12-month effort, full control, expensive)

Stakeholders:
- **CFO**: Wants to minimize cost. Not interested in option 2 or 3.
- **Technical Lead**: Wants stability and long-term control. Prefers option 3.
- **Product Manager**: Wants launch in 6 months. Only option 1 or 2 can work.
- **You**: You are supposed to recommend which to proceed with.

**Questions**:
1. What decision-making approach would you use? Why?
2. What questions would you ask to understand everyone's interests?
3. What option would you recommend?
4. How would you present that recommendation to stakeholders who disagree?
5. What would you do if the CFO vetoed your recommendation and insisted on option 1?
