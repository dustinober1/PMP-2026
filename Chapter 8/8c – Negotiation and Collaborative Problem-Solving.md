# 8c – Negotiation and Collaborative Problem-Solving

Sarah realizes that **negotiation is not about winning and losing. It is about creating solutions that neither party would have found alone.**

For the first four months, Sarah thought negotiation was about convincing the other person your idea was better. But when she shifted to asking, "What do we both need? What is the creative solution?" everything changed.

In the transformation program, Sarah was trying to negotiate between corporate standardization and regional flexibility. She kept getting stuck: either the regions got flexibility (no standardization) or they had to follow corporate (no flexibility). Neither side was happy.

Then Sarah asked a different question: "What is the core process that must be standard? What is the implementation detail that can vary?" Suddenly there was a path: standard business process, flexible technology choices. The regions got what they really needed (ability to adapt to their context). Corporate got what they really needed (consistency across the enterprise).

This section teaches you to **shift from positional negotiation (I want X, you want Y) to interest-based negotiation (I need A, you need B; how do we both get what we need?)**.

## 8.1 Two Types of Negotiation: Positional vs. Interest-Based

### 8.1.1 Positional Negotiation (Zero-Sum or Win-Lose)

**What it is**: Each party has a position, and negotiation is about moving toward a compromise.
- You: "I want the project to launch in March"
- Them: "I want 6 months"
- Compromise: "We will do May"

**How it works**:
- Each party states their position
- You negotiate on the position
- Typically, you settle on a middle ground
- Someone has to move from their original position

**Why it often fails**:
- The compromise may satisfy no one
- The underlying needs are not addressed
- If you both cared deeply about your positions, compromise leaves you both unhappy
- It is a zero-sum game: if you move, they win; if they move, you win
- Trust is eroded (each side feels they lost)

**Example**:
The renovation project could have been positional: Finance wants $400K budget, Facilities wants $600K budget, so you settle on $500K. But if Finance needs cost control for financial reasons and Facilities needs investment in quality for operational reasons, the compromise solves neither problem.

### 8.1.2 Interest-Based Negotiation (Win-Win or Integrative)

**What it is**: Each party explores underlying interests and needs. You look for solutions that satisfy the interests (even if not the original positions).
- You: "I need the project to launch soon because the business opportunity closes at year-end"
- Them: "I need time because the scope is complex and requires thorough implementation"
- Creative solution: "What if we phase it? Launch core features by year-end (address your timeline need), then expand in Q1 (address your quality need)?"

**How it works**:
1. Clarify your own interests (not just your position)
2. Understand their interests (not just their position)
3. Look for creative solutions that address both interests
4. Both parties can come away satisfied

**Why it works better**:
- You address the real needs, not just the stated positions
- Creative solutions are possible that neither side thought of
- Both parties feel heard and respected
- It builds trust instead of eroding it
- The solution is more likely to stick

**Example**:
In the expense system, the Finance Manager's interest was not "full integration" (position). The interest was "having good data for financial analysis" (real need). The CFO's position was "minimize cost," but the interest was "get the system launched quickly" (real need). Once they understood each other's interests, they could find a phased solution that addressed both.

---

## 8.2 Interest-Based Negotiation Framework

Sarah learns a structured approach to interest-based negotiation:

### Step 1: Clarify Your Own Interests

Before negotiating, be clear on what you really need (your interests), not just what you are asking for (your position).

**Questions to ask yourself**:
- What is my underlying concern? (e.g., "I said 'March' but why? Because the business opportunity ends then" or "Because I am worried the team will get distracted")
- What am I really trying to protect? (e.g., quality, timeline, relationship, budget)
- What would success look like for me? (e.g., "A system that works well AND launches by Q1")
- What am I worried will happen if I do not get my position? (e.g., "If we do not launch by March, the business advantage is lost")
- Is there a different way to address that worry? (e.g., "Maybe we do not need to launch in March; maybe we need to stay ahead of competitors, which might be possible in April")

**Sarah's example**:
Sarah thought she needed "the architect and agile coach to agree on one technical approach." But her real interest was "confidence that we can deliver a quality system on time." Once she understood her interest, she could explore solutions (phased approach, splitting responsibilities) that addressed her interest without requiring agreement on technical approach.

### Step 2: Understand Their Interests

Do not assume you know what they want. Ask.

**Questions to ask them**:
- "What is important to you about this?"
- "Help me understand why that matters"
- "What would happen if we did it differently?"
- "What concerns do you have?"
- "What would success look like for you?"
- "If I could satisfy one thing about this, what would it be?"

**Listen to the answer**. Do not interrupt or argue.

**Sarah's example**:
Sarah asked the Finance Manager: "You said you want full integration. Help me understand why that is so important." The Finance Manager said: "I do not want to be entering expense data into two systems. It is a waste of time and error-prone. I need the data in one place."

That is different from "full integration." Sarah realized the interest was "not duplicating work," not "technical integration." Once she understood that, other solutions became possible.

### Step 3: Look for Common Ground

Where do your interests and their interests overlap? Start there.

**Questions**:
- "We both want this project to succeed. What would that look like for each of us?"
- "Where do we agree?"
- "What do we both value?"

**Sarah's example**:
Sarah asked the architect and agile coach: "You both want the system to work well and deliver on time, right?" Both said yes. "So it is not whether we care about quality and speed—we both do. It is about how we balance them. Is that right?" Both agreed. That reframing—from disagreement to balancing—opened the conversation up.

### Step 4: Generate Options

Brainstorm solutions that might address both interests. Do NOT evaluate yet. Just generate options.

**Rules**:
- List ideas without judgment
- Defer evaluation
- Creative ideas are welcome, even if they seem crazy
- The goal is quantity, not quality (more options increase likelihood of a good one)

**Questions to spark ideas**:
- "What if we did both?"
- "What if we did them at different times?"
- "What if we split responsibility?"
- "What if we found a completely different way?"
- "What if we involved someone else?"
- "What if the constraint changed?"

**Sarah's example**:
For the scope-schedule-cost conflict in the renovation:
- "What if we launch the core space and add finishes later?" (address timeline need without cutting quality)
- "What if we use different finishes in different areas?" (reduce cost in less critical areas)
- "What if we negotiate with vendors for extended payment terms?" (spread budget across time)
- "What if we focus on the core areas first and expand the project scope later?" (phasing)

### Step 5: Evaluate Options Against Interests

Now evaluate the ideas. Which ones address both interests best?

**Criteria for evaluation**:
- Does this address my core interest?
- Does this address their core interest?
- Is this implementable? (feasible, within constraints)
- Do we both feel good about this? (not just "I can live with it" but "I prefer this")

**Sarah's example**:
From the options above, the phased approach best addressed both interests: launch the core space by March (timeline need), then add finishes in phases (quality need). Both Facilities and Finance preferred this to straight compromise.

### Step 6: Reach Agreement

Once you have an option that addresses both interests, formalize the agreement.

**Agreement should include**:
- What you both agreed to
- What success looks like
- Timeline and milestones
- How you will handle changes
- How you will monitor/measure

**Put it in writing**, even if it is just an email: "We agreed that X will happen by date Y. Specifically, [details]. If circumstances change, we will revisit this together."

## 8.3 Negotiating Scope, Schedule, and Budget

These are the most common negotiations in projects.

### 8.3.1 Scope Negotiation

**Typical positional negotiation** (not effective):
- Stakeholder: "I need all these features"
- You: "We do not have time or budget"
- Compromise: "You get 70% of the features"
- Result: Neither party gets what they wanted

**Interest-based negotiation** (more effective):

**Step 1: Clarify their interests**:
- "Why are these features important?"
- "What are you trying to accomplish?"
- "If we could deliver the most important ones first, would that work?"

Often, not all features are equally important. When you ask, you learn that 20% of the features drive 80% of the value.

**Step 2: Clarify your constraints and interests**:
- "Here is what we can deliver in the timeline. These are the constraints."
- "I am interested in delivering something you love and can use, even if it is not everything you wanted."

**Step 3: Find options**:
- "What if we launch with features A, B, C (highest value), then add D, E, F in phase 2?"
- "What if we prioritize differently?"
- "What features could we simplify to get more things in the first release?"

**Sarah's example**:
For the expense system, the CFO wanted expense routing, approval workflows, integration with the general ledger, and reporting. All in 3 months. Sarah asked: "Which of these would have the biggest impact if we delivered first?"

The CFO said: "Expense routing. That is the biggest pain point right now."

Sarah said: "What if we deliver rock-solid routing in 3 months, then add approval workflows and reporting in months 4-6? Would that work?"

CFO said: "Yes, if routing is done well."

Result: Clear scope for phase 1 (routing), clear understanding of phase 2 (other features). Both parties aligned on priority.

### 8.3.2 Schedule Negotiation

**Typical positional negotiation** (not effective):
- Sponsor: "I need this by March"
- Team: "We need 6 months"
- Compromise: "We will try to do it in 4.5 months"
- Result: Unrealistic commitment, team burned out, quality compromised

**Interest-based negotiation** (more effective):

**Step 1: Understand their timeline interest**:
- "Why March? What is driving that date?"
- "What happens if we deliver in April instead?"
- "Is March a true deadline or a goal?"

Often, deadlines are not as firm as stated. Sometimes the interest is "early as possible," not a specific date.

**Step 2: Understand the team's concern**:
- "What is realistic given the scope and constraints?"
- "What risks exist if we try to go faster?"
- "What would we need to accelerate?"

**Step 3: Find options**:
- "What if we reduce scope to hit March, then add features later?"
- "What if we add resources?"
- "What if we change the approach to go faster?"
- "What if the timeline is phased?"

**Sarah's example**:
For the renovation, the CFO wanted March 15 completion. The contractor estimated April 15 for a quality project. Sarah asked: "What is critical about March 15?"

CFO said: "A client visit. We want to show off the space."

Sarah asked: "Does it have to be finished? Or just opened?"

CFO said: "Actually, if the core space is usable and looks good, that is enough."

Solution: Core space finished by March 15 (client visit). Remaining finishes completed by April 30. Both parties got their need met.

### 8.3.3 Resource Negotiation

**Typical positional negotiation** (not effective):
- You: "I need 2 developers full-time"
- Their manager: "They are only available 30% of the time"
- Result: Unhappy with the 30%, but that is what you have

**Interest-based negotiation** (more effective):

**Step 1: Clarify your needs**:
- "What work requires dedicated developers?"
- "What work could be done by someone more junior?"
- "What could be parallelized?"

Often, not all work needs senior developers. When you clarify, you might need 1 senior developer and 1 junior developer, not 2 senior.

**Step 2: Clarify their constraints**:
- "What other commitments do they have?"
- "When would they be available?"
- "What is the minimum they could contribute?"

**Step 3: Find options**:
- "What if we get 1 senior developer (high-priority work) and 1 junior developer (learning work)?"
- "What if we get 1 senior developer full-time for 3 months, then they step back?"
- "What if we hire a contractor for part of the work?"

**Sarah's example**:
For the expense system, Sarah needed developers but they were also committed to other projects. Instead of fighting for their full time, Sarah said: "I need a senior developer full-time for architecture and complex features. I need a junior developer full-time for standard features. And I need 20% of the data analyst's time for testing."

By breaking down the needs, she got what she really needed without creating conflict over "full-time."

## 8.4 BATNA: Your Best Alternative to Negotiated Agreement

Before negotiating, know your **BATNA**—what you will do if you cannot reach agreement.

**Example**:
- If you cannot agree on a technical approach with the architect, your BATNA is "escalate to the CTO for a decision"
- If you cannot agree on scope with the sponsor, your BATNA is "launch with minimum viable product and add features later"
- If you cannot agree on timeline with the team, your BATNA is "reduce scope or add resources"

**Why BATNA matters**:
- If you do not know your BATNA, you might accept a bad deal just to avoid conflict
- If your BATNA is strong, you can negotiate from confidence
- If your BATNA is weak, you need to negotiate harder or accept less favorable terms
- You should only accept a deal that is better than your BATNA

**Sarah's approach**:
Before negotiating with the Finance Manager about integration, Sarah clarified her BATNA: "If we cannot agree, I will recommend to the CFO that we launch simple integration and expand later. That is my preferred solution anyway."

Armed with that clarity, Sarah could negotiate confidently. She was not desperate to reach agreement. She was comfortable with her BATNA. That made the negotiation more balanced.

## 8.5 Collaborative Problem-Solving Techniques

Beyond formal negotiation, you can use several techniques to solve problems collaboratively:

### 8.5.1 Root Cause Analysis

When there is conflict, ask: **What is the real problem?**

**Technique: The Five Whys**
1. "Why is this a problem?" [Answer]
2. "Why is that the case?" [Answer]
3. "Why is that?" [Answer]
4. "Why?" [Answer]
5. "Why?" [Answer—usually by the 5th why, you have found the root cause]

**Example**:
- "Why are regional directors resisting the standard process?"
  - "Because it does not work for their context"
- "Why does it not work for their context?"
  - "Because their business is different—smaller scale, fewer resources"
- "Why would fewer resources be a problem?"
  - "Because the process requires 3 people; they only have 2"
- "Why do we have a 3-person process?"
  - "Because headquarters designed it for their scale"
- "Why was it not designed for multiple scales?"
  - "We did not think about it. We assumed everyone operates like HQ"

Root cause: The process was not designed with regional diversity in mind. Solution: Create a scalable version of the process.

### 8.5.2 Reverse Brainstorming

Instead of "How do we solve this?" ask, "How would we create this problem?"

**Example**:
- Problem: "The team is not collaborating well"
- Reverse brainstorm: "How would we create a team that does NOT collaborate?"
  - "Keep them in separate locations with no video meetings"
  - "Do not create a shared goal or vision"
  - "Have one person make all decisions without input"
  - "Do not provide time for collaboration"
- Solution: Do the opposite of what would create the problem
  - "Make sure they have frequent face-to-face time"
  - "Co-create the vision and goals"
  - "Make decisions collaboratively"
  - "Build collaboration time into the schedule"

### 8.5.3 Perspectives Exercise

Get multiple stakeholders to see the problem from different viewpoints.

**Example**:
- "From the Finance perspective, what is the issue?"
- "From the Operations perspective, what is the issue?"
- "From the Customer perspective, what is the issue?"
- "From the Team perspective, what is the issue?"

Often, different perspectives reveal dimensions of the problem no one noticed alone.

### 8.5.4 Scenario Planning

Instead of debating what will happen, create scenarios and plan for each.

**Example**:
- "Scenario 1: We go fast (3 months). What risks might we encounter?"
- "Scenario 2: We go slow (6 months). What risks might we encounter?"
- "Scenario 3: We go phased (3 + 3 months). What risks might we encounter?"

By exploring scenarios, you can make an informed choice about which risk profile you prefer.

## 8.6 What Breaks Negotiation

Sarah learns that certain behaviors break negotiations:

**Do NOT**:
- **Make it personal**: "You always do this" instead of "In this situation..."
- **Use power tactics**: Threatening, intimidating, using authority unjustly
- **Withhold information**: Hiding constraints or options to gain advantage
- **Change terms mid-negotiation**: Agreeing to something then saying "actually..."
- **Assume bad faith**: Assuming they are being difficult on purpose
- **Walk away without explanation**: Ending the negotiation without clarity on where things stand
- **Involve third parties to pressure them**: Going around them to their boss without discussing first

**Do**:
- **Stay focused on interests, not positions**
- **Be transparent**: Share constraints and options openly
- **Listen actively**: Actually try to understand their perspective
- **Stay calm**: Manage emotions; do not let frustration take over
- **Be willing to say "I do not know"**: If you need more information, say so
- **Keep the door open**: Even if you cannot reach agreement now, keep the relationship intact for future negotiation

## Key Takeaways: Negotiation and Collaborative Problem-Solving

1. **Interest-based negotiation beats positional negotiation**: Focus on underlying needs, not stated positions
2. **Clarify your own interests first**: Know what you really need before negotiating
3. **Understand their interests**: Ask, listen, verify understanding
4. **Look for creative solutions**: Solutions that address both interests often exist if you look for them
5. **Common ground is a starting point**: Build from agreement, not disagreement
6. **BATNA gives you leverage**: Know your best alternative so you do not accept bad deals
7. **Scope, schedule, budget are interconnected**: Negotiate the whole picture, not individual pieces
8. **Root cause analysis reveals real problems**: Dig beneath the surface issue
9. **Multiple perspectives reveal complexity**: Get stakeholder views on the problem
10. **Transparency builds trust**: Share information openly; withholding erodes trust

## Practice Scenario

**Context**: Your team is burning out. The project is demanding—long hours, high pressure, weekend work. Two senior team members have said they are considering leaving if the pace does not change.

Stakeholder positions:
- **Sponsor**: "We need to launch by Q2. That is non-negotiable. The market window is closing."
- **Team Lead**: "We cannot sustain this pace. My people are exhausted. Either we slow down or they leave."
- **Your position**: You want to keep the team and hit the deadline.

**Questions**:
1. What are the interests behind each position? (not just what they said, but why they care)
2. What creative options might address both the timeline and the team's need for sustainability?
3. What is your BATNA if you cannot find a solution?
4. How would you frame a negotiation conversation?
