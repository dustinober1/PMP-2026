# 8e – Knowledge Check: Conflict, Negotiation, and Decision-Making

This section provides scenario-based practice questions to test your understanding of conflict resolution, negotiation, and decision-making. These questions reflect the types of conflicts and decisions you will encounter on the PMP exam—situations requiring you to navigate disagreement, find solutions, and make sound decisions.

---

## Instructions

For each scenario, read the situation carefully and select the **best answer** based on the concepts covered in Chapter 8. The best answer aligns with PMI's approach to conflict resolution and stakeholder collaboration.

Answers and detailed explanations follow the questions.

## Scenario 1: Identifying Conflict Sources

You are managing an agile software project. The development team and QA team are in conflict:
- **Development Team** says: "QA is too slow. They are blocking our sprints. They need to test faster or we will not hit our 2-week sprint goals."
- **QA Team** says: "Development is shipping features with bugs. We cannot test faster without sacrificing quality. You are pushing us to compromise on quality."

Both teams are frustrated. The product owner is frustrated that sprints are slipping. You need to understand what is really being fought about.

**Question 1.1**: What is the likely root cause of this conflict?

A) QA is incompetent at their job and should be replaced
B) The sprint duration is too short for the scope and quality required
C) Development and QA are competing for priority; one must yield
D) Development prioritizes speed; QA prioritizes quality. Neither perspective is wrong, but the trade-off has not been made explicit

**Answer: D) Development prioritizes speed; QA prioritizes quality. Neither perspective is wrong, but the trade-off has not been made explicit**

**Explanation**: This is not about incompetence or competition. This is about a trade-off that has not been made explicit. Development is right that they need to hit sprints. QA is right that quality matters. The question is: "How do we balance speed and quality?" If the answer is "do both perfectly," that is unrealistic. The team needs to explicitly decide the trade-off.

Root cause analysis:
- Stated conflict: Speed vs. Quality
- Underlying concern: Development worries about missing sprint goals; QA worries about shipping broken features
- Real issue: No agreement on the acceptable quality standard for "done"

Why other options are less correct:
- A) Assumes QA is the problem. Both teams are trying to do their job.
- B) May be true (sprint length is a factor), but the real conflict is about the trade-off, not the schedule
- C) This is not a competition for priority; both can do their jobs if expectations are clear

This illustrates: **Root cause is usually about different priorities or unclear expectations, not incompetence.**

**Question 1.2**: Which conflict source best describes this situation?

A) Resource constraint (not enough people, time, or budget)
B) Competing priorities (speed vs. quality)
C) Interpersonal/personality clash (the teams just do not like each other)
D) Information gap (QA does not understand development constraints)

**Answer: B) Competing priorities (speed vs. quality)**

**Explanation**: This is a classic competing priority conflict. Both teams want to succeed. They prioritize differently. This is not an interpersonal clash (if you put new people in these roles, you would still have the conflict). It is not a personality issue. It is a legitimate difference in what matters.

Why other options are less correct:
- A) There may be a resource constraint, but the core issue is about priorities
- C) No evidence this is about personal dislike; if they respected each other's constraints, they could work together
- D) Both teams probably understand the constraints; they are not ignorant

This illustrates: **Competing priorities are a normal source of conflict. Acknowledging both priorities (not dismissing one) is how you address them.**

---

## Scenario 2: Conflict Resolution Approaches

Your two senior managers—one from Operations and one from Technology—fundamentally disagree on how to implement a major system change:
- **Operations** wants a phased implementation (one department at a time, learn and adjust)
- **Technology** wants a big-bang implementation (all at once, clean from a technical perspective)

The decision has to be made. Both managers have equal authority (no clear decision-maker above them). Both are smart, experienced, and well-respected. You cannot escalate this (it is your call to make as the PM). You need to resolve it.

**Question 2.1**: Which conflict resolution approach would be most appropriate?

A) Competing: Insist on the technology approach because it is more efficient
B) Collaborating: Spend time understanding both perspectives and look for a solution that addresses both concerns
C) Compromising: Implement half in phase 1, half in phase 2 (split the difference)
D) Accommodating: Defer to operations since they understand implementation better
E) Avoiding: Wait and see if consensus emerges naturally

**Answer: B) Collaborating: Spend time understanding both perspectives and look for a solution that addresses both concerns**

**Explanation**: This situation calls for collaboration:
- **Both concerns are important**: Speed of implementation AND quality/learning
- **You have time**: This decision is important enough to spend time on
- **You need buy-in**: Both managers need to support the decision and implement it
- **Creative solution possible**: There may be an approach that gives you the benefits of both (phased technology rollout with big-bang data migration, for example)

By collaborating, you:
1. Understand Operations' concern: "Phasing lets us learn and adjust. Big-bang is risky."
2. Understand Technology's concern: "Big-bang is technically cleaner. Phasing creates technical debt."
3. Ask: "What if we do a phased business rollout but coordinate the technology cleanly?"
4. Find the hybrid that addresses both

Why other options are less correct:
- A) Competing would override Operations' legitimate concerns; they would support reluctantly
- C) Compromise (half/half) might not work well technically or operationally; creates a mediocre solution
- D) Accommodating would give up on Technology's concerns; might create technical problems later
- E) Avoiding delays the necessary decision and creates frustration

This illustrates: **When both parties are smart, when time allows, and when a creative solution is possible, collaborate.**

---

**Question 2.2**: During the collaboration, Operations says: "I cannot support a big-bang. We have 50 departments using this system. If something goes wrong, we lose everything."

How should you respond?

A) "I understand your concern. Big-bang is actually safer because we go live once, not multiple times"
B) "I understand your concern. Losing service to 50 departments would be catastrophic. Tell me more about what risks you see with big-bang"
C) "That is what testing is for. If we test properly, nothing will go wrong"
D) "We have no choice. The sponsor wants big-bang. We have to do it"

**Answer: B) "I understand your concern. Losing service to 50 departments would be catastrophic. Tell me more about what risks you see with big-bang"**

**Explanation**: This response:
1. **Acknowledges their concern**: Shows you heard them and take it seriously
2. **Reflects back what you heard**: "Losing service to 50 departments would be catastrophic"—this shows understanding
3. **Invites deeper exploration**: "Tell me more about the risks you see"—this opens the conversation, not closes it

This is how you collaborate effectively. You are not dismissing their concern or overriding their perspective. You are genuinely trying to understand it. From there, you can explore whether big-bang or phased addresses the risk better.

Why other options are less correct:
- A) Disagrees with their concern without understanding it; argues instead of listens
- C) Dismisses the risk ("testing will prevent it"); lacks empathy for their concern
- D) Escalates to authority; cuts off collaboration and violates the collaborative approach you chose

This illustrates: **In collaborative conflict resolution, listen and understand before responding with your view.**

## Scenario 3: Negotiation and Interest-Based Solutions

You are negotiating budget for a critical project. The CFO says: "I can allocate $100K. That is the limit."

Your project needs: architects ($150K), developers ($200K), QA ($100K), and project management ($50K) = $500K total

You say: "We need $500K to do this right."

CFO: "The budget is $100K. Do the best you can."

This looks like a stalemate. You are in a positional negotiation (I want $500K, you offer $100K). You need to shift to interest-based negotiation.

**Question 3.1**: What is the CFO's likely interest (not position)?

A) Minimize spending on projects (they are a cost controller by nature)
B) Ensure the project delivers value that exceeds the investment
C) Avoid committing to a large budget that might be wasted
D) Maintain discretion to allocate budget to other priorities

**Answer: B) Ensure the project delivers value that exceeds the investment**

**Explanation**: The position is "The budget is $100K." The interest is probably something deeper. Possible interests:
- They do not believe the project is worth $500K (value concern)
- They do not have $500K available (budget constraint)
- They want to test the project first before investing heavily (risk management)
- They do not trust that you will not waste money (credibility concern)

Most likely, they care about **value delivered per dollar spent**. If you can show that $100K on the right priority will deliver more value than $500K spread across everything, they might agree.

Why other options are less correct:
- A) Assumes a personality trait, not an interest; may not be true
- C) Possibly true, but it assumes they are risk-averse without evidence
- D) Possibly true, but it assumes they are keeping options open, which may not be the case

This illustrates: **The position "The budget is $100K" may hide an interest like "I want to see if this delivers value before we invest heavily."**

---

**Question 3.2**: How would you shift to interest-based negotiation?

A) "I understand the budget is limited. Can you help me understand what is most critical? If I can only invest $100K, where should it go?"
B) "The project needs $500K. If you do not fund it properly, it will fail, and that is on you"
C) "Other projects got more budget. Why is our project being treated unfairly?"
D) "Let me show you how $100K will not be enough and the project will have to be cut"

**Answer: A) "I understand the budget is limited. Can you help me understand what is most critical? If I can only invest $100K, where should it go?"**

**Explanation**: This response:
1. **Acknowledges the constraint**: "I understand the budget is limited"—shows you are realistic
2. **Shifts perspective**: Instead of arguing about total budget, asks "What is critical?"
3. **Invites problem-solving**: "Where should $100K go?"—works with the CFO, not against them

This opens the conversation to interest-based problem-solving. Now you can explore:
- "Can we phase the project? Invest $100K in phase 1 (highest priority), then $150K in phase 2?"
- "Can we use different skills? Maybe more junior people for some work?"
- "Can we defer some components? Do we need all three architects, or can we start with one?"

Why other options are less correct:
- B) Blames the CFO; ends the negotiation
- C) Makes it about fairness, not about solving the project problem
- D) Argues about the budget instead of working within it

This illustrates: **Instead of fighting the constraint, work within it. Ask "How do we solve this with what we have?"**

## Scenario 4: Making Decisions

Your steering committee needs to decide on the project timeline. Two camps:
- **Fast**: Deliver in 6 months (business opportunity closes then)
- **Safe**: Take 12 months (allows proper testing and quality)

The committee has been discussing this for two weeks. Everyone has spoken. No clear consensus is emerging. People are getting frustrated. You need a decision.

**Question 4.1**: What decision-making approach should you use?

A) Keep discussing until consensus emerges (do not rush)
B) Call for a vote and go with the majority
C) Say, "I need to hear one more round of perspectives, then I am going to decide"
D) Escalate to the board for them to decide

**Answer: C) Say, "I need to hear one more round of perspectives, then I am going to decide"**

**Explanation**: This approach:
1. **Shows respect**: "I want to hear from everyone one more time"
2. **Sets boundaries**: "Then I am going to decide"—signals that discussion has limits
3. **Maintains authority**: You are not abdicating the decision; you are using good judgment about when discussion is enough
4. **Gathers final input**: Maybe someone has a perspective that unlocks consensus

The statement manages expectations: you have tried collaboration/consensus, it is not working, now you are moving to consultative decision-making (gather input one more time, then decide).

Why other options are less correct:
- A) They have already discussed for two weeks; more discussion will not help
- B) A vote creates winners and losers; someone will resent the decision
- D) Escalation is appropriate if you lack authority or information, not because you are tired of discussing

This illustrates: **Know when discussion has been thorough enough. At some point, you need to decide.**

---

**Question 4.2**: In the final round, a committee member says: "I have a concern that we have not discussed. If we go with 6 months, we might have to cut testing. I am worried about quality."

This is new information (first time this specific concern has been raised clearly). How do you respond?

A) "We have already discussed timeline vs. quality. This does not change anything"
B) "That is a valid concern. Can we design a 6-month plan that does not sacrifice critical testing?"
C) "Quality is important. But the business opportunity ends. We have to accept some risk"
D) "Good point. Let me reconvene the committee next week to discuss this further"

**Answer: B) "That is a valid concern. Can we design a 6-month plan that does not sacrifice critical testing?"**

**Explanation**: You have already discussed for two weeks, so you are right to move toward decision. But this is genuinely new insight (not the same concern re-stated). The concern is: "6 months + quality testing is not compatible." The question is: "Is there a way to do 6 months without sacrificing critical testing?"

Maybe the answer is: "Critical testing is in parallel with development, not sequential" or "We cut nice-to-have features to make room for testing" or "We have more testers for the first 6 months."

By asking "Can we design a 6-month plan that does not sacrifice critical testing?" you:
1. Validate the concern
2. Invite problem-solving
3. Do not reopen endless discussion
4. Look for a solution that might satisfy everyone

Why other options are less correct:
- A) Dismisses a valid concern; might miss important insight
- C) Acknowledges the business deadline but does not try to solve the quality concern
- D) Reopens discussion; goes back on your decision to decide now

This illustrates: **Listen to new insights even when discussion time is ending. But look for solutions, not endless re-discussion.**

---

## Scenario 5: Escalation

You are managing a project with a clear decision-maker (the Sponsor, a VP). A conflict has emerged between the Technology Director and Operations Manager on a critical decision. You have tried multiple approaches:
- Consultative approach: Both perspectives heard, but they still disagree
- Collaborative approach: Spent two meetings trying to find a hybrid solution, but neither party will budge
- Compromise approach: Suggested 50-50, both parties rejected it

Both parties have roughly equal authority. The decision cannot be made at your level because it is outside your scope (it is a strategic business decision). The Sponsor needs to decide.

**Question 5.1**: What is the best way to escalate this?

A) "Our team cannot reach agreement on the technical approach. The sponsor needs to make the call"
B) "Technology wants option A. Operations wants option B. Here is what we gain with option A [details]. Here is what we gain with option B [details]. We need you to decide which aligns better with your strategy"
C) "I recommend option A because the technical benefits outweigh the operational concerns"
D) "We have explored this thoroughly. Options A and B are both viable. I am escalating because I cannot make this call alone"

**Answer: B) "Technology wants option A. Operations wants option B. Here is what we gain with option A [details]. Here is what we gain with option B [details]. We need you to decide which aligns better with your strategy"**

**Explanation**: This escalation:
1. **Is clear**: States both options explicitly
2. **Provides analysis**: Explains trade-offs of each option
3. **Connects to strategy**: Asks the Sponsor to decide based on strategic alignment (not just technical or operational merits)
4. **Gives clear decision criteria**: The Sponsor can use strategy as the deciding factor

This makes the Sponsor's job easy. You have done the analysis; you are asking them to apply strategic judgment.

Why other options are less correct:
- A) Too vague; does not give the Sponsor the information they need to decide
- C) You cannot recommend if both parties have equal authority; it looks like you are taking a side
- D) Explains your situation but does not give the Sponsor what they need to decide

This illustrates: **When escalating, provide clear options, analysis of trade-offs, and decision criteria. Make it easy for the decision-maker to decide.**

## Scenario 6: Handling Reversible vs. Irreversible Decisions

You have two decisions to make:
1. **Technical decision**: Which cloud platform to use (AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud)?
2. **Organizational decision**: Whether to consolidate two teams into one or keep them separate?

Both decisions have stakeholders who disagree. You have limited time (you need to decide on both by next week).

**Question 6.1**: How should you approach these decisions differently?

A) Use the same decision-making approach for both; treat them equally
B) Make the technical decision quickly (reversible); spend more time on the organizational decision (harder to reverse)
C) Make the organizational decision quickly (depends on people); take time with the technical decision (complex)
D) Escalate both decisions; they are too important to make yourself

**Answer: B) Make the technical decision quickly (reversible); spend more time on the organizational decision (harder to reverse)**

**Explanation**: The cloud platform decision is largely reversible. If you choose AWS and it does not work, you can migrate to Azure in six months. It is not easy, but it is possible.

The organizational decision is hard to reverse. If you consolidate teams and it damages morale or creates silos, fixing that takes months or years.

So you should:
- Cloud platform: Make the decision with available information. You do not need perfect information. "We are choosing AWS because [reasons]. If we learn we should have chosen Azure, we can revisit in 6 months."
- Team organization: Spend more time. Talk to the team members. Understand the implications. Make sure you are right before restructuring.

Why other options are less correct:
- A) Not all decisions deserve equal time investment
- C) Organizational decisions affecting people are often irreversible; treat with care
- D) You can make both decisions; escalation is not necessary for every tough decision

This illustrates: **Reversible decisions deserve less analysis time. Irreversible decisions deserve more.**

## Final Reflection Questions

These questions require you to reflect on concepts from Chapter 8 as a whole:

**Reflection 1**: You have resolved a conflict and made a decision. Not everyone is happy with the outcome. One stakeholder pulls you aside and says, "I do not agree with this decision. I think it is wrong."

How do you respond?

Answer: "I hear you. I considered your perspective carefully. Here is why I made this decision: [reasoning]. I know you do not agree, but I need your commitment to make this work. Can you support this decision even if you would have chosen differently?" Then listen. You are not asking them to agree; you are asking them to commit. That is realistic.

---

**Reflection 2**: You are in a conflict discussion. You realize the other person's perspective is actually better than yours. You were wrong about something important.

How do you respond?

Answer: "I need to adjust my thinking. I hear what you are saying, and I think you are right about [specific point]. I want to reconsider my position based on this." Then do reconsider. Saying "I was wrong" and adjusting builds credibility and respect. Do not persist in being wrong just to save face.

---

**Reflection 3**: You have made a decision and communicated it. People are executing it. Now you learn new information that suggests the decision was wrong.

Should you change the decision?

Answer: It depends. If the decision is reversible and the new information is significant, yes, reconsider and potentially change it. If the decision is irreversible or partially implemented, be more careful. But do not stubbornly stick with a bad decision just to avoid admitting you were wrong. The goal is project success, not preserving your decision-making credibility.

## Summary

This knowledge check covered:
- **8a concepts**: Sources of conflict, root causes vs. symptoms, understanding disagreement, healthy conflict
- **8b concepts**: Five conflict resolution modes (competing, collaborating, compromising, accommodating, avoiding) and when to use each
- **8c concepts**: Interest-based negotiation, negotiating scope/schedule/budget, collaborative problem-solving
- **8d concepts**: Decision-making models, the decision tree, reversible vs. irreversible decisions, escalation

**Key PMI Principles Tested**:
- Conflict is not bad; it is information that needs to be addressed
- Different conflicts require different resolution approaches
- Interest-based negotiation creates better solutions than positional negotiation
- Different decision-making approaches suit different situations
- Reversible decisions deserve less analysis; irreversible decisions deserve more
- Good decisions require good communication and commitment from those affected
- Escalation is appropriate when decisions exceed your authority
