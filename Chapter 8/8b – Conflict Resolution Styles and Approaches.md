# 8b – Conflict Resolution Styles and Approaches

Sarah learns that **every conflict resolution approach has a purpose**. The goal is not to always be "nice" or always to "win." The goal is to choose the right approach for the situation.

When the renovation project discovered the fire safety issue, Sarah could not compromise. Safety is not negotiable. She had to compete/insist on a solution that met the safety requirement. When two developers disagreed on coding standards but both approaches were acceptable, Sarah did not need to insist on one. She could accommodate or compromise.

This section teaches you the **Thomas-Kilmann Conflict Mode Instrument** (TKI)—a framework for understanding five different ways to handle conflict, when each is appropriate, and how to choose.

## 8.1 The Five Conflict Resolution Modes

The five modes are defined on two dimensions:
- **Assertiveness**: How much you push for your concerns
- **Cooperativeness**: How much you consider the other person's concerns

### 8.1.1 Competing (High Assertiveness, Low Cooperativeness)

**What it is**: You pursue your concerns at the other person's expense. You stand firm on your position and try to convince them you are right.

**How it looks**:
- "This is the right approach. Here is why I think you are wrong."
- "We are doing it this way because it meets our requirements."
- You use authority, expertise, or persuasion to win the argument
- You may override the other person's concerns

**When to use it**:
- **When the stakes are high and you are confident you are right**: "We cannot launch until the security vulnerability is fixed" (non-negotiable safety issue)
- **When time is critical**: "We need to decide now. Here is my recommendation." (you do not have time for lengthy discussion)
- **When the other person is being unreasonable**: "No, we cannot add 6 months to the schedule without revisiting the business case. That is not how this works."
- **When quick action is needed and you have authority**: "I am making the call. We are going with option A."
- **When you have significantly more information or expertise**: "I have 20 years of experience in this technology. I am confident this is the right approach."

**When NOT to use it**:
- When you need the other person's buy-in or cooperation (competing may create resentment)
- When the other person has equal authority or more authority than you
- When you want to preserve the relationship
- When you might be wrong (you could learn from their perspective)

**Risks**:
- The other person may feel unheard or disrespected
- They may comply but resent the decision
- You may miss important information they had
- Relationship suffers

**Sarah's example**:
When the fire safety issue emerged, Sarah competed. She said, "We cannot use a layout that blocks a fire exit. That is non-negotiable. Here are three options that meet the safety requirement. Which do you prefer?" She was assertive (firm on the requirement) but not completely uncooperative (she asked which of the safe options they preferred).

### 8.1.2 Collaborating (High Assertiveness, High Cooperativeness)

**What it is**: You work together to find a solution that satisfies both parties' concerns. You spend time understanding both perspectives and looking for creative solutions.

**How it looks**:
- "Let me understand your concerns. Here is my concern. Where is the common ground?"
- You ask questions and really listen
- You brainstorm creative solutions
- The goal is mutual satisfaction, not winning

**When to use it**:
- **When both concerns are important**: "Both timeline and quality matter. Let's find a way to achieve both."
- **When you want buy-in and commitment**: "This is important enough to get right. Let's spend time figuring this out together."
- **When you might learn something**: "You know your region better than I do. Let's figure out how to adapt the standard approach."
- **When the relationship matters**: "This person is important to the project. I want us to find a solution we both believe in."
- **When there is a creative solution possible**: "I think we can have both scalability and speed if we structure the work this way..."

**When NOT to use it**:
- When time is critical and you do not have time for discussion
- When the issue is not important enough to justify the time investment
- When the other person is not willing to engage in good faith
- When one concern must override the other (like safety)

**Risks**:
- Takes more time
- Requires both people to be willing to collaborate
- If the other person is competing while you are collaborating, you may lose

**Sarah's example**:
With the architect-agile coach conflict, Sarah collaborated. She said, "I understand your concerns about scalability and about timeline. Both matter. Let's figure out how we can build a foundation that is sustainable AND move fast." The solution involved doing some architecture work upfront (address scalability concern) while still iterating quickly (address timeline concern).

### 8.1.3 Compromising (Moderate Assertiveness, Moderate Cooperativeness)

**What it is**: Both parties give up something to reach an agreement in the middle.

**How it looks**:
- "You want 18 months, I want 12 months. Let's do 15 months."
- "You want all these features, I want the minimum. Let's launch with half the features now and half later."
- Everyone gives up something

**When to use it**:
- **When both concerns are somewhat important but time is limited**: "We do not have time to find a perfect solution, but we need to decide. Let's split the difference."
- **When the parties have equal power**: "We both have valid points, and neither of us can override the other. Let's meet in the middle."
- **When a quick resolution is more important than a perfect solution**: "A compromise is better than prolonging this conflict."

**When NOT to use it**:
- When one issue is non-negotiable (like safety)
- When a collaboration solution exists that would satisfy everyone more
- When compromise leaves both people unsatisfied

**Risks**:
- Both people feel partially satisfied and partially unsatisfied
- The compromise might be worse than either original position
- People may feel like they lost instead of won
- If you keep compromising, the middle ground keeps shifting

**Sarah's example**:
In the expense system, the CFO wanted to minimize budget and the Finance Manager wanted full integration. Sarah compromised: launch with simple integration in month 3 (address budget and speed concerns), then build more integration in months 4-6 (address Finance Manager's need). Both got something.

### 8.1.4 Accommodating (Low Assertiveness, High Cooperativeness)

**What it is**: You set aside your concerns to let the other person have what they want. You prioritize the relationship or the other person's needs.

**How it looks**:
- "Your concern is more important than mine. Let's do it your way."
- "I do not feel strongly about this. What do you prefer?"
- You may feel like you are giving in

**When to use it**:
- **When the other person's concern is more important than yours**: "You know this area better; let's go with your recommendation."
- **When the issue is not critical to you**: "I do not care which tool we use. Choose what works for your team."
- **When preserving the relationship is more important**: "This is not worth damaging our relationship over."
- **When you want to build goodwill for future conflicts**: "I will go along with this now because you usually defer to me and I appreciate that."
- **When you realize you are wrong**: "I understand your concern now. You are right. Let's do it your way."

**When NOT to use it**:
- When an important concern of yours is being overridden
- When the other person is taking advantage of your accommodation
- When you are accommodating to avoid conflict instead of addressing the real issue

**Risks**:
- You may feel resentful (you gave in but do not feel good about it)
- The other person may not realize you accommodated (they think they won the argument)
- If you accommodate too much, people may see you as weak or easy to push around
- The issue may come back later (if you really cared about it)

**Sarah's example**:
When a junior team member suggested a coding practice Sarah was unsure about, Sarah accommodated. "I trust your technical judgment here. Let's try your approach." This preserved the relationship and gave the junior member autonomy. If Sarah had competed or insisted on her approach, the junior member would have felt overridden.

### 8.1.5 Avoiding (Low Assertiveness, Low Cooperativeness)

**What it is**: You step back from the conflict. You do not pursue your concerns or the other person's concerns. You hope the issue resolves itself or that someone else handles it.

**How it looks**:
- Not bringing up the issue
- Changing the subject when conflict emerges
- "Let's not talk about this now"
- Hoping the problem goes away

**When to use it**:
- **When the issue is trivial**: "I do not care about this enough to spend energy on it."
- **When timing is not right**: "Let's not discuss this now; let's talk after the sprint."
- **When emotions are too high**: "Let's take a break and come back to this when we are calmer."
- **When the cost of resolution is higher than the cost of the problem**: "This is not worth the time and energy to resolve."
- **When you need to gather more information**: "I am not ready to have this conversation yet. Let me understand the issue better."

**When NOT to use it**:
- When the issue is important and will not resolve itself
- When avoiding makes the problem worse
- When the other person needs a decision from you
- As a habit instead of a temporary strategy

**Risks**:
- The problem may grow if not addressed
- The other person may feel unsupported or ignored
- Resentment builds
- Issues pile up and eventually explode
- You may be seen as conflict-avoidant

**Sarah's example**:
Early in the transformation program, Sarah avoided a conflict between the design team and pilot teams (who felt excluded from decisions). She thought it would resolve itself. It did not—the tension grew. Sarah eventually had to address it directly.

## 8.2 Choosing the Right Mode for the Situation

The key skill is knowing **when to use which approach**. Here is a decision framework:

**Step 1: How important is the issue to you?**
- If not important: Accommodate or avoid
- If very important: Compete or collaborate

**Step 2: How important is the relationship?**
- If relationship is critical: Collaborate or accommodate
- If relationship is less critical: Compete or compromise

**Step 3: How much time do you have?**
- If time is limited: Compete, accommodate, or compromise
- If time is available: Collaborate

**Step 4: Can both concerns be satisfied?**
- If yes: Collaborate
- If no: Compromise or compete

**Step 5: Do you have authority to decide?**
- If yes: You can compete or collaborate
- If no: Compromise or accommodate

**Decision Matrix**:

| Situation | Best Mode | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Safety issue (non-negotiable) | Compete | Some things cannot be compromised |
| Technical approach (both teams right) | Collaborate | Time to find solution that addresses both concerns |
| Minor preference difference | Accommodate | Relationship and goodwill matter more than this specific issue |
| Quick decision needed, both have merit | Compromise | Split the difference and move forward |
| Timing is not right for discussion | Avoid | Come back when the time is better |
| You realize the other person is right | Accommodate | Learn and defer to their expertise |

## 8.3 Sarah's Real-World Decisions

Let's see how Sarah applied these modes in practice:

### Fire Safety Issue (Renovation)

**Situation**: The furniture layout blocked a fire exit. Contractor wanted to use a narrower cabinet. Facilities Manager wanted to redesign the layout.

**Sarah's decision**: COMPETE
- **Why**: Safety is non-negotiable. This is not a matter of preference or trade-off.
- **How**: "Both options must meet the fire code. Here are three layouts that satisfy the fire exit requirement. Facilities Manager, which of these works for your space planning?"
- **Result**: The Facilities Manager chose a layout. The contractor installed a narrower cabinet. Everyone was safe.

### Architect-Agile Coach Conflict (Expense System)

**Situation**: Architect wanted scalable foundation. Agile coach wanted simplest thing that works.

**Sarah's decision**: COLLABORATE
- **Why**: Both concerns were important (quality and speed). Both people were smart and invested in the project's success. Sarah had time (still in planning phase).
- **How**: "I understand you both want this to succeed. Let's figure out how to build something that is sustainable AND moves fast. Can we do some foundation work in week 1, then iterate?" They brainstormed and came up with a hybrid approach.
- **Result**: Architect felt heard about sustainability. Agile coach felt heard about speed. The team committed to a solution they all believed in.

### Regional Director Resistance (Transformation)

**Situation**: Regional directors wanted flexibility in implementation. Corporate wanted standardization.

**Sarah's decision**: COLLABORATE (initially), then COMPROMISE
- **Why**: Both perspectives had merit. Standard processes create consistency. Regional flexibility addresses local context. But Sarah also had to acknowledge that some standardization was non-negotiable.
- **How**: "The core process is standard (headquarters requirement). How you implement each step in your region is flexible. Let's figure out what is flexible and what is fixed." After discussion, they found the hybrid worked.
- **Result**: Regional directors got autonomy within guardrails. Corporate got standardization. Neither party got 100% of what they wanted, but both got their core needs met.

### Budget Trade-off (Renovation)

**Situation**: Multiple cost-saving ideas were proposed. Some saved money but reduced quality. Facilities Manager was concerned about long-term durability.

**Sarah's decision**: COMPROMISE
- **Why**: Both cost control and quality mattered. Both were finite (limited budget, limited time). Sarah needed to make decisions quickly. Neither side was willing to budge completely.
- **How**: "Let's identify the three most important quality elements (from Facilities perspective) and the three biggest cost drivers (from Finance perspective). We will protect the quality elements and cut costs elsewhere."
- **Result**: The renovation came in slightly under budget with acceptable quality. Not everyone was thrilled, but everyone could live with it.

### Junior Developer's Suggestion (Expense System)

**Situation**: Junior developer proposed a coding approach Sarah was uncertain about.

**Sarah's decision**: ACCOMMODATE
- **Why**: Sarah did not have strong conviction about her approach. The junior developer knew the technology. Relationship and autonomy were important.
- **How**: "I trust your technical judgment. Let's try your approach. If it does not work, we can adjust."
- **Result**: The junior developer felt valued. The approach worked. Sarah learned something. The team was stronger.

## 8.4 What NOT to Do in Conflict

As important as knowing when to compete or collaborate is knowing what not to do:

**Do NOT**:
- **Attack the person** ("You are wrong") instead of the idea ("I see it differently")
- **Assume bad intent** ("You are trying to make me look bad") instead of asking ("Help me understand your thinking")
- **Escalate emotionally** ("This is ridiculous!") instead of staying calm
- **Make it personal** ("You always do this") instead of focusing on this situation
- **Dismiss their concerns** ("That is not important") instead of understanding them
- **Triangulate** (tell someone else instead of addressing directly)
- **Hold grudges** (resolve this and move forward)
- **Use your power unjustly** ("I am the PM so we are doing it my way")

---

## 8.5 When to Escalate Beyond These Modes

Sometimes you cannot resolve a conflict with these five modes. You need to escalate.

**When to escalate**:
- **Irreconcilable difference in authority**: You and a peer cannot agree, and the decision needs to be made by your shared manager
- **Values conflict**: Two people have fundamentally different values and neither will compromise
- **Trust breakdown**: The relationship has deteriorated so much that discussion is not productive
- **Deadlock**: You have tried multiple approaches and the conflict persists
- **Power imbalance**: One party is using power in a way that is not productive

**How to escalate**:
1. **Try to resolve at your level first**: Make sure you have genuinely tried to collaborate or compromise before escalating
2. **Get alignment on the issue**: Before going to the manager, make sure both parties agree on what the conflict is
3. **Present options to the manager**: Do not just say, "We cannot agree." Say, "We have tried A, B, and C. Here are the trade-offs of each. We need you to decide which is the priority."
4. **Accept the decision**: Once escalated and decided, both parties need to support it

## Key Takeaways: Conflict Resolution Styles

1. **Five modes exist**: Competing, collaborating, compromising, accommodating, avoiding
2. **Each has a purpose**: No mode is always right; choose based on the situation
3. **Consider importance, time, relationship, authority**: These factors determine which mode to use
4. **Know your natural style**: Understand your bias so you can intentionally adapt
5. **Avoid personal attacks**: Separate person from idea
6. **Safety and ethics are non-negotiable**: Compete on these; do not compromise
7. **Collaboration creates better solutions**: When possible and when time allows, invest in collaboration
8. **Compromise is realistic**: Sometimes the middle ground is the right answer
9. **Escalate when necessary**: If you cannot resolve at your level, escalate clearly
10. **Move forward after resolution**: Once decided, let go of the conflict and work together

---

## Practice Scenario

**Context**: You are managing a software project. Two developers disagree on the technology stack:
- **Developer A** (senior, 10 years experience): "We should use Technology X. I have built three systems with it. It is proven and reliable."
- **Developer B** (junior, but highly skilled in new technologies): "We should use Technology Y. It is modern, the team can learn it, and it is better for long-term maintenance."

You have 6 weeks to decide and start implementation. Both developers are critical to the project. This is an important decision that affects the architecture for years.

**Questions**:
1. Which conflict resolution mode would you use? Why?
2. How would you apply that mode?
3. What questions would you ask to understand both perspectives?
4. How would you decide if they still disagree after discussion?
5. How would you maintain the relationship with the person whose approach was not chosen?
