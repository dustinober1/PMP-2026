## Two Types of Change: Scope vs. Organizational

When people talk about "change management," they often mean two different things. Clarifying this distinction is essential.

### Scope Change Control (Process Domain)

**Scope change control** is the formal process for managing requests to modify project scope. It's a **technical/administrative** process governed by the change control board.

**Example scope changes**:
- Stakeholder requests a new feature not in the original scope
- Requirements analysis reveals missing functionality
- Integration with another system is more complex than expected
- Technology constraints force design modifications

**How it's managed**:
1. Change request is submitted
2. Impact analysis: What would this change cost in schedule, budget, quality, risk?
3. Change control board decision: Approve, defer, or decline?
4. If approved, adjust the project plan
5. Execute the change; track its impact

Scope change control is **governed by formal processes** and **follows formal decision-making** (Chapter 8 discusses governance).

### Organizational Change Management (People Domain)

**Organizational change management** (OCM) is the process of helping **people and organizations** adopt new ways of working. It's a **people-focused** process.

**Examples of organizational change**:
- Implementing a new software system (people must learn and adopt it)
- Changing business processes (people must adapt their work)
- Restructuring teams (people must adjust to new reporting lines and roles)
- Shifting from waterfall to agile delivery (teams must adapt their mindsets and practices)
- Moving from office to hybrid work (people must adjust their work habits)

**How it's managed**:
1. Understand the current state: How do people currently work?
2. Define the future state: How will work change?
3. Assess the gap: What's different? What skills must people develop?
4. Develop adoption strategies: How will we help people transition?
5. Execute change activities: Training, communication, coaching, support
6. Monitor adoption: Are people using the new way? Do they understand it?
7. Sustain the change: Reinforce new ways; prevent backsliding

**The connection**: Scope changes often require organizational change. When a project delivers new software, people must adopt it. When a project implements new processes, teams must work differently. Project managers often overlook this; they assume delivery = adoption. It doesn't.

## Change Psychology: Why People Resist

Understanding why people resist change is essential to managing it effectively. It's not irrationality; it's human nature.

### The Change Curve (Kübler-Ross and Bridges)

People don't transition from "current state" to "future state" instantly. They go through psychological stages:

1. **Denial/Shock**: "This won't really happen" or "This can't be as bad as they say"
   - People minimize the change or assume it won't affect them

2. **Resistance/Anger**: "I don't want this" or "Why are we doing this?"
   - People become frustrated or angry
   - This is when you hear "The old way was fine" or "You're ruining everything"
   - This stage is often expressed as conflict (Chapter 8)

3. **Bargaining/Negotiation**: "Can we do it differently?" or "Can we delay this?"
   - People try to negotiate exceptions or modifications
   - This is healthy; it shows they're starting to accept the change

4. **Depression/Sadness**: "I'm worried I can't handle this" or "This is too much"
   - People experience self-doubt, anxiety, or sadness about losing the old way
   - Performance often declines temporarily

5. **Acceptance**: "I understand; let me learn" or "I can see the benefits"
   - People begin accepting the new way and developing competence
   - Performance improves

**Duration**: This progression typically takes 6-12 months for significant organizational change, though individual people move through at different speeds.

**Implications for project managers**:
- **Expect resistance**: It's normal, not a sign of poor planning
- **Don't dismiss concerns**: Listen; validate; address underlying worries
- **Provide support**: Training, coaching, and communication help people move through stages faster
- **Be patient**: People need time to adjust; rushing through these stages doesn't work
- **Celebrate progress**: When people move through stages, acknowledge it

### Why People Really Resist Change

Research on resistance shows that opposition to change usually comes from:

1. **Loss of control**: "I'm worried about losing power or influence"
2. **Loss of competence**: "I'm skilled at the current way; I'll be incompetent with the new way"
3. **Loss of relationships**: "I'll lose working relationships with people I trust"
4. **Loss of identity**: "I've defined myself by this role; change threatens who I am"
5. **Unclear purpose**: "I don't understand why we're doing this"
6. **Distrust of leadership**: "I don't believe leadership has good intentions"

**Strategies for addressing each**:

| Resistance Driver | Strategy |
|---|---|
| Loss of control | Involve people in designing the change; give choices where possible |
| Loss of competence | Provide training; start small; let people build confidence gradually |
| Loss of relationships | Maintain team structures where possible; facilitate relationship building in new structure |
| Loss of identity | Help people see continuity ("You're still a great analyst; now you'll use new tools") |
| Unclear purpose | Communicate the *why*; help people see benefits for them, not just the organization |
| Distrust of leadership | Demonstrate trustworthiness through actions; be transparent; follow through on commitments |

### Stages of Adoption

People adopt change at different rates:

- **Innovators** (2-3%): Early adopters; embrace change immediately
- **Early adopters** (13-14%): Follow soon after; serve as champions
- **Early majority** (34%): Adopt when change is proven and normalized
- **Late majority** (34%): Adopt after change is clearly working; need more evidence
- **Laggards** (16%): Last to adopt; may never fully adopt

**Implication**: Don't expect everyone to adopt at once. Design strategies for each group:
- **Innovators/Early adopters**: Give them visible roles; make them coaches and champions
- **Early majority**: Show them evidence of success; provide strong training
- **Late majority**: Demonstrate that change is normalized; provide peer support
- **Laggards**: Focus on consequences and support; some may not adopt, and that's a management decision

## Change Management Frameworks

Several frameworks help structure change management work. Two of the most widely used are Kotter's 8-Step Process and Prosci's ADKAR Model.

### Kotter's 8-Step Change Model

This framework, developed by John Kotter, outlines how to lead major organizational change:

1. **Establish a sense of urgency**
   - Help people understand why change is necessary
   - Paint a compelling picture of what happens if we don't change
   - Create dissatisfaction with the current state

   *Example: Sarah's transformation program begins by showing executives the competitive landscape. "Companies adopting digital tools are outpacing us. Within 3 years, we'll be unable to compete if we don't modernize."*

2. **Build a guiding coalition**
   - Assemble leaders and influencers who believe in the change
   - This group guides the change effort and models new behaviors
   - Diverse representation (different departments, levels, demographics) is important

   *Example: Sarah assembles a transformation steering committee that includes the CFO (for credibility), a respected IT manager (for technical credibility), and a frontline supervisor (for employee credibility).*

3. **Form a strategic vision**
   - Define what the future state looks like
   - Make it clear, compelling, and easy to communicate
   - Tie it to organizational values and strategy

   *Example: "In 2 years, our teams will use integrated digital tools to make decisions faster, serve customers better, and work more effectively together."*

4. **Communicate the vision**
   - Communicate relentlessly; use multiple channels; repeat often
   - Leaders model and reinforce the vision through their actions
   - Create a feedback loop; listen to concerns and address them

   *Example: Monthly town halls focus on the transformation vision; team managers discuss it in one-on-ones; intranet content reinforces the vision; leaders visibly use new tools.*

5. **Empower action**
   - Remove obstacles to change
   - Give people permission to experiment
   - Recognize and reward people taking action toward the vision

   *Example: Teams are freed from some routine work to focus on transformation. People who volunteer for early adoption get recognition. Processes that block change are streamlined.*

6. **Create short-term wins**
   - Design the change to show results quickly
   - Celebrate these wins publicly
   - Use them to build momentum and credibility

   *Example: The expense system pilot goes live early. Users see it works. They become advocates. Word spreads. "The transformation is real and working."*

7. **Consolidate improvements**
   - Use early wins to build on momentum
   - Make changes permanent; embed them in processes, training, hiring
   - Continue to communicate progress

   *Example: After the expense system success, the team launches the next tool. Credibility is established. Adoption is faster.*

8. **Anchor changes in culture**
   - Make new ways the norm
   - Update hiring, training, performance evaluation to reinforce new behaviors
   - Tell stories about people exemplifying the new way

   *Example: New employees are trained in both old and new tools; they see the transformation as normal. Performance reviews include feedback on using new tools. Success stories about transformation benefits are shared regularly.*

### Prosci's ADKAR Model

This framework focuses on individual change and adoption:

1. **Awareness**: Help people understand the need for change
   - "Why are we doing this?"
   - "What happens if we don't change?"

2. **Desire**: Help people develop motivation to change
   - "What's in it for me?"
   - "How does this connect to my values?"
   - Address concerns that drive resistance

3. **Knowledge**: Provide the skills and information people need
   - Training on the new way
   - Coaching and support
   - Clear documentation and reference materials

4. **Ability**: Build people's capability to use the new way
   - Practice and feedback
   - Real-world application
   - Mentoring and support until confidence builds

5. **Reinforcement**: Make the change stick
   - Celebrate progress
   - Update processes and systems to reinforce new behaviors
   - Address backsliding quickly
   - Make the new way the "normal" way

**ADKAR is individual-focused**; different people progress at different rates. Your change management plan must address all five elements for most people to successfully adopt.

**Example from Sarah's transformation program**:

- **Awareness**: Town halls, emails, one-on-ones explaining why transformation is necessary
- **Desire**: Leaders talk about benefits; early adopters share positive experiences; concerns are addressed in forums
- **Knowledge**: Training workshops, online learning, job aids, documentation
- **Ability**: Small group coaching, peer mentoring, supervised practice, feedback
- **Reinforcement**: Success stories, recognition of adopters, process changes that require new tool usage, new hiring and training embed new ways

## Mini-Plan: Organizational Adoption of AI-Enabled Solutions

When change involves introducing AI-enabled tools (for example, an AI assistant in a service desk or a recommendation engine in a customer portal), the **change steps are the same**, but the risks and questions often focus on trust, skills, and ethics.

A simple AI adoption change plan can follow this structure:

1. **Assessment and Planning**  
   - Identify who will be affected (roles, locations, vendors)  
   - Clarify what will change (tasks automated, decisions assisted by AI, new handoffs)  
   - Check for special considerations (privacy, regulatory requirements, union or HR constraints)  

2. **Communication and Education**  
   - Explain **why** AI is being introduced (supporting people, not replacing them)  
   - Address common concerns (job impact, fairness, data use) directly and transparently  
   - Share examples of appropriate and inappropriate use of the AI tool  

3. **Implementation and Support**  
   - Provide hands-on training and practice, using real scenarios from the team’s work  
   - Set clear expectations for **human review** of AI suggestions  
   - Provide support channels (champions, office hours, FAQs) during rollout  

4. **Monitoring and Adjustment**  
   - Track adoption metrics (who is using the tool, how often, and for what)  
   - Gather feedback on trust, usability, and perceived value  
   - Adjust training, communication, or process design when issues emerge  

5. **Sustainment and Governance**  
   - Embed AI-related responsibilities into roles, procedures, and performance expectations  
   - Align with governance structures (PMO, data governance, ethics committees) for ongoing oversight  
   - Periodically review whether the AI solution is still delivering benefits and operating within agreed guardrails  

On the exam, AI-specific change scenarios are still **change management questions**. Strong answers show you:

- Treating AI introduction as a **people change**, not just a technical deployment  
- Communicating clearly, involving affected stakeholders, and monitoring adoption  
- Escalating ethical, legal, or risk concerns through existing governance channels rather than ignoring them  

## Stakeholder Adoption Strategies

Different stakeholders require different strategies for adoption.

### Executive Leadership

**Their concerns**:
- Will this deliver promised benefits?
- What's the cost and ROI?
- What's the risk to business continuity?

**Adoption strategies**:
- Keep executives informed of progress and risks
- Link to strategic objectives
- Provide regular benefit tracking
- Address concerns about risk and continuity

### Middle Managers

**Their concerns**:
- Will this make my job harder?
- Will I still be effective?
- How do I manage my team through this?

**Adoption strategies**:
- Help them see how this supports their goals
- Train them on the new way
- Coach them on how to lead their teams through change
- Make them partners in change, not passive recipients

### Individual Contributors

**Their concerns**:
- Will I be able to do my job?
- Will this make my work harder?
- What support will I have?

**Adoption strategies**:
- Make training accessible
- Provide peer mentors and coaches
- Give them room to practice without consequences
- Listen to their feedback and show you're responsive
- Celebrate their progress

### Resisters

**Their concerns**: Often multiple; these people are most at risk of not adopting

**Adoption strategies**:
- Understand specifically what they're resisting and why
- Address underlying concerns (loss of control, loss of competence, etc.)
- Don't dismiss them; they often raise valid issues
- Give them extra support and patience
- Set expectations clearly; some may choose not to adapt and that's their choice (with consequences)

## Building Commitment and Addressing Resistance

### The Commitment Spectrum

People exist on a spectrum of commitment to change:

```
Champions → Supporters → Neutral → Skeptics → Resisters
   (5%)       (30%)      (50%)      (10%)      (5%)
```

Your goal is to move people toward the left; your minimum goal is to move them from "Resister" to "Skeptical" or "Neutral."

**Strategies for different groups**:

| Group | Characteristics | Strategy |
|-------|---|---|
| **Champions** | Believe in change; advocate for it | Empower them; use them as coaches; give them visibility |
| **Supporters** | Support the change; participate in it | Recognize and reinforce their support; give them small leadership roles |
| **Neutral** | Unsure; waiting for more evidence | Provide evidence; make the change feel inevitable; reduce their risk |
| **Skeptics** | Have concerns; need evidence | Address specific concerns; provide experience and training; patience |
| **Resisters** | Oppose the change; may sabotage | Understand what drives their resistance; address if possible; manage if not |

### Addressing Specific Resistance

When people resist, don't dismiss them. Understand and address:

1. **Identify the root concern**: Is it fear of incompetence? Loss of control? Distrust of leadership? Loss of relationships?

2. **Listen and validate**: "I hear you're concerned about [concern]. That makes sense because [reason]."

3. **Address the concern**: Provide training for competence concerns, involve them in planning for control concerns, build trust through transparency, etc.

4. **Follow up**: Check in with them; show you've taken their concern seriously

5. **Set expectations**: If they choose not to adopt, there are consequences. Be clear about what's required.

**Example from Sarah's transformation program**:

Some middle managers resist the new project management tools. Digging deeper, Sarah discovers:
- **Actual concern**: "I'll lose visibility into my team's work" (loss of control)
- **Root cause**: The tools have different reporting structures than they're used to
- **Sarah's response**:
  - Involves the managers in designing the reporting structure
  - Trains them on how to use the tools to get the information they need
  - Pairs them with a coach who shows them the visibility is actually *better* with the new tools
  - Celebrates when they see benefits
- **Result**: Skepticism turns to support

## Organizational Readiness for Change

Not every organization is ready for change at the same time. Assessing readiness helps you adjust your strategy.

**Readiness factors**:

| Factor | High Readiness | Low Readiness |
|--------|---|---|
| **Executive sponsorship** | Visible, committed sponsor | Absent or passive sponsor |
| **Sense of urgency** | People feel need for change | Complacency; "the old way works" |
| **Organizational stability** | Stable; room for change focus | Crisis mode; multiple changes happening |
| **Change capacity** | People have bandwidth for change | Overwhelmed; overworked |
| **Trust in leadership** | High trust; credible messengers | Low trust; skepticism about leadership |
| **Culture of change** | History of successful change | History of failed initiatives |
| **Clear vision** | Compelling future state | Vague or unclear direction |

**Implications**:
- **High readiness**: You can move faster; people are motivated to adopt
- **Low readiness**: You need to move slower; invest more in buy-in and engagement before rolling out change

**Example from Sarah's scenarios**:

*Office Renovation (high readiness)*: Everyone agrees the office space is outdated. Excitement about a new office is high. Communication is simple: "Here's the vision; let's make it happen." Adoption is natural.

*Transformation Program (moderate-to-low readiness initially)*: The organization isn't in crisis; many people are comfortable with the current way. Sarah must build urgency (competitive landscape), get executive sponsorship, and start with high-readiness groups. She doesn't try to change everyone at once.

## Change Management Across Delivery Approaches

### Predictive
- **Change ownership**: Change management is typically a formal function; sometimes a dedicated change manager or organizational change team
- **Timing**: OCM planning happens during the planning phase; execution happens during and after delivery
- **Approach**: Comprehensive plan (training schedule, communication plan, sponsor strategy)
- **Pace**: Slower, more coordinated approach; people have time to prepare for the change
- **Integration**: Change plan is integrated with project plan

*Example: Sarah's office renovation project includes a change management plan that covers how staff will adapt to the new workspace. Training on new amenities is scheduled before move-in. Communication about the move happens over 6 months. Managers are trained on supporting their teams.*

### Agile
- **Change ownership**: Team self-manages adoption; product owner ensures stakeholder feedback is incorporated
- **Timing**: Change happens continuously; each iteration delivers new features for people to adopt
- **Approach**: Continuous user feedback; frequent demonstrations; learning from early adopters
- **Pace**: Fast; users adapt quickly because change is incremental
- **Integration**: Change feedback is incorporated into backlog; adoption challenges become backlog items

*Example: Sarah's expense system is delivered in sprints. Users see features every 2 weeks. They adapt gradually. Sprint reviews include user feedback; if adoption is challenging, training or design changes are made in the next sprint.*

### Hybrid
- **Program level**: Formal OCM planning for strategic changes and organizational impacts
- **Team level**: Agile approach to getting user feedback and adapting delivery based on adoption challenges
- **Integration**: Program-level communication supports team-level adoption; OCM metrics are tracked at program level

*Example: Sarah's transformation program has a formal change management plan (strategic communication, leadership engagement, change impact assessment). Individual initiative teams deliver features incrementally; user adoption feedback goes into both sprint planning and program-level OCM adjustments.*

## Measuring Change Effectiveness

How do you know if change management is working? Track:

**Adoption metrics**:
- **Usage**: % of target audience actively using the new way
- **Proficiency**: Confidence levels; support request volume
- **Sustainability**: Is usage sustained 3, 6, 12 months after launch?

**Outcome metrics**:
- **Benefits realization**: Are promised benefits being achieved?
- **Performance**: Metrics that change should improve (productivity, quality, cycle time, cost, satisfaction)
- **Engagement**: Employee feedback on the change; engagement survey results

**Risk metrics**:
- **Resistance**: Who is resisting? How strong is the resistance? Is it decreasing?
- **Turnover**: Is attrition higher in change-impacted groups?
- **Quality/safety**: Are mistakes increasing? Safety issues?

**Example from Sarah's transformation program**:

After expense system launch:
- **Adoption**: 85% of target users actively using the system within 90 days (goal was 80%)
- **Proficiency**: Support ticket volume decreases after 3 months (training is working)
- **Benefits**: Expense reporting time per employee decreases from 45 minutes to 15 minutes; CFO has better expense data
- **Sustainability**: 9 months post-launch, 80% are still using the system actively (acceptable; some power users depend on it)
- **Engagement**: Post-launch survey shows 72% positive response to the new system (up from 45% pre-launch skepticism)

## Key Takeaways

- **Scope change and organizational change are different**: Scope change control is process-based; organizational change is people-focused
- **Resistance is normal**: People move through a change curve; understanding why they resist helps you address it
- **Different groups require different strategies**: Champions, supporters, neutral, skeptics, and resisters each need tailored approaches
- **Frameworks help**: Kotter's 8-step process and ADKAR provide structured approaches to leading change
- **Readiness matters**: Assess organizational readiness and adjust your pace and strategy accordingly
- **Communication and visibility build adoption**: People need to understand the *why*, see evidence that change is real and working, and get support through transition
- **Adoption is an outcome, not an event**: Change management continues after delivery; you must sustain new behaviors and processes
- **Different delivery approaches manage change differently**: Predictive plans it comprehensively upfront; agile adapts continuously; hybrid does both

### Complexity and Change Management

**Traditional change management** assumes:
- Clear end state is known and can be planned
- Linear progression through change stages
- Controllable cause and effect relationships

**Complexity-aware change management** recognizes:
- The future emerges through the change process
- Non-linear patterns of adoption and resistance
- Adaptive capacity as more important than detailed planning

**Key shifts for complexity:**
- From detailed rollout plans to directional roadmaps with adaptation points
- From managing resistance to enabling emergence
- From fixed success criteria to evolving outcomes
- From comprehensive communication to continuous dialogue

## Reflection Questions

1. **Your change experience**: Think of a change you've experienced (organizational, technical, or personal). Where did you fall on the commitment spectrum (champion to resister)? What drove your position?

2. **Resistance patterns**: In organizations you know, what types of resistance come up most often? Is it fear of incompetence? Loss of control? Distrust?

3. **Adoption strategies**: For a change you're planning or have experienced, what strategies worked to build adoption? What didn't? What would you do differently?

4. **Readiness assessment**: Is your organization ready for the changes you're trying to implement? Which readiness factors are strong? Which are weak? How does this affect your change strategy?
