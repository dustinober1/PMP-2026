# 7.1 – Risk, Issues, and Change Management

## Chapter Overview

Risk is fundamental to project management. Every decision—from scope definition to resource allocation to delivery approach—involves some level of uncertainty. This section teaches how to identify, analyze, respond to, and monitor risks throughout the project lifecycle. It also covers the closely related challenges of issue management and organizational change.

Unlike passive risk management (hoping nothing goes wrong), effective project managers treat risk as a strategic asset. They ask: *What could go wrong? How likely is it? How would we respond? How do we stay ahead of it?*

In this section, you'll follow Sarah as she applies risk management principles across her three projects—and see how different delivery approaches demand different risk strategies. From the detailed risk planning required in her office renovation project, to the continuous risk adaptation in her agile expense system, to the program-level risk governance of her transformation initiative, risk management shapes every major decision she makes.

## ECO Alignment

This chapter addresses the following tasks from the PMP Certification Exam Content Outline (ECO):

| Domain | Task | Coverage |
|--------|------|----------|
| Business Environment | Task 3: Manage and Control Changes | Primary (12e) |
| Business Environment | Task 4: Remove Impediments and Manage Issues | Primary (12d) |
| Business Environment | Task 5: Plan and Manage Risk | Primary (12a-c) |

**How This Chapter Covers the ECO Tasks:**

These three tasks require you to:
- Identify, analyze, and respond to risks proactively
- Develop risk management plans and maintain risk registers
- Execute risk response strategies and monitor ongoing risk
- Distinguish between risks (potential future problems) and issues (current problems)
- Escalate issues appropriately and facilitate resolution
- Execute formal change control processes and communicate changes
- Update project documentation to reflect changes

**Coverage in This Chapter:**
- **7.1a**: Understanding risk, appetite, tolerance, and how risk management differs across delivery approaches
- **7.1b**: Risk identification and analysis techniques (qualitative and quantitative)
- **7.1c**: Risk response strategies for threats and opportunities
- **7.1d**: Issue management, escalation, and resolution
- **7.1e**: Change management (both scope change control and organizational change)
- **7.1f**: Scenario-based practice questions integrating all three elements

This chapter emphasizes that risk, issues, and change are interconnected. Effective management of all three—proactive risk response, rapid issue resolution, and controlled change—determines whether projects adapt successfully to uncertainty or become derailed by problems.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

- Define risk, risk appetite, and risk tolerance in project contexts
- Distinguish between threats and opportunities in risk management
- Identify risks using multiple techniques (interviews, brainstorming, expert judgment)
- Analyze risks qualitatively and quantitatively
- Develop appropriate risk response strategies (avoid, mitigate, accept, exploit, enhance)
- Understand how risk management differs across predictive, agile, and hybrid approaches
- Distinguish between risks and issues, and manage each appropriately
- Implement escalation and resolution processes for issues
- Lead organizational change in support of project outcomes
- Address resistance to change and build stakeholder commitment

## Key Themes for This Chapter

1. **Risk is inevitable and manageable.** Projects operate in environments with inherent uncertainty. Effective managers don't try to eliminate risk; they anticipate it, plan for it, and respond to it actively.

2. **Different delivery approaches require different risk strategies.**
   - **Predictive**: Comprehensive risk planning upfront; formal change control board; risk register maintained throughout; assumptions and constraints rigorously tracked
   - **Agile**: Continuous risk identification and adaptation; retrospectives used to surface and address risks; emergent risks handled within sprint cycles
   - **Hybrid**: Program-level risk governance and formal planning; team-level adaptive responses; balance between upfront planning and continuous adaptation

3. **Issues are realized risks.** Once a risk event occurs and becomes a problem requiring immediate action, it becomes an issue. Issues need escalation, accountability, and resolution processes.

4. **Change management is both technical and organizational.** Beyond the formal change control process (ECO: Process Domain – Task 8.2), successful projects require attention to the human side: resistance patterns, stakeholder adoption, and organizational culture shifts.

5. **Risk management builds team confidence and organizational learning.** When teams have clear processes for surfacing, discussing, and resolving risks and issues, psychological safety increases. Teams are more willing to innovate and speak up early about problems.

## Integration with Previous Chapters

- **Chapter 03 (Building and Leading Teams)**: Psychological safety, conflict resolution, and influence skills are essential for surfacing and discussing risks openly
- **Chapter 04 (Stakeholder Engagement and Communication Mastery)**: Risk discussions and change communications require tailored stakeholder engagement and clear messaging
- **Chapter 05.1 (Starting the Project)**: Risk appetite and organizational tolerance are defined during project initiation
- **Chapter 06.1 (Planning for Value Delivery)**: Risk impacts are incorporated into schedules, budgets, and resource plans

## The Three-Project Narrative: Risk Across Delivery Approaches

### Office Renovation (Predictive)
Sarah's office renovation project has high financial stakes, regulatory requirements, and fixed deadlines. Risk is pervasive: vendor availability, permitting delays, construction unknowns, and stakeholder scope creep. Sarah develops a detailed risk register during planning, holds formal risk reviews, and maintains a change control board. The predictable, sequential nature of construction allows for risk response planning upfront.

### Expense System (Agile)
The expense system is being built incrementally with evolving requirements. Sarah's team identifies risks continuously through backlog refinement, sprint planning, and retrospectives. New technical risks emerge as they build; user adoption risks surface only as features are demonstrated. Risk management is embedded in the agile rhythm: user story definition includes risk considerations, definition of done includes quality gates, and retrospectives surface both process and product risks.

### Transformation Program (Hybrid)
The digital transformation spans multiple teams and initiatives. At the program level, Sarah manages strategic risks (organizational readiness, executive alignment, benefits realization) with formal governance. At the team level, each initiative manages delivery risks with agile flexibility. Organizational change is paramount: staff are anxious about new tools and processes, managers worry about control and visibility, and executives are concerned about ROI. Sarah uses change management frameworks to build commitment and address resistance.
