# 7.1f – Knowledge Check: Risk, Issues, and Change Management

## Practice Questions

These practice questions test your understanding of risk management, issue management, and change management across delivery approaches. Each question includes a short explanation to reinforce the exam logic.

## Question 1

**Domain**: Process (41%)  
**ECO Task**: Plan and manage risk

During a project status meeting, a vendor confirms they will miss a key delivery date by two weeks. The team had previously captured “vendor delay” as a risk.

**What should the project manager do FIRST?**

A) Update the risk register because the risk is now more likely.  
B) Log it as an issue, assign an owner, and start resolution actions.  
C) Submit a change request to the change control board immediately.  
D) Wait until the next risk review to avoid overreacting.

**Answer: B**

**Explanation**: Once the risk event occurs, it becomes an issue that requires immediate action. Logging it as an issue (with an owner and target resolution) starts the resolution workflow. You may also update the risk register status, but the first priority is issue response.

## Question 2

**Domain**: Business Environment (26%)  
**ECO Task**: Support organizational change

An executive sponsor tells you: “We’re willing to take calculated risks to modernize our tooling, but we cannot tolerate more than a one-week delay to the compliance deadline.”

The “one-week delay” statement is an example of:

A) Risk appetite  
B) Risk tolerance  
C) Residual risk  
D) Opportunity enhancement

**Answer: B**

**Explanation**: Risk appetite is the broad willingness to take risk for strategic goals. Risk tolerance is a specific threshold (e.g., schedule variance) stakeholders are willing to accept.

## Question 3

**Domain**: Process (41%)  
**ECO Task**: Assess and prioritize risks

A team is using a simple probability-impact matrix (Low/Medium/High) to prioritize risks. Which risk should be prioritized for active management?

A) Probability: Low; Impact: Medium  
B) Probability: Medium; Impact: Low  
C) Probability: High; Impact: High  
D) Probability: Low; Impact: Low

**Answer: C**

**Explanation**: High-probability, high-impact risks sit in the “upper-right” of the matrix and require active response planning and monitoring.

## Question 4

**Domain**: Process (41%)  
**ECO Task**: Use quantitative risk analysis

A project manager is doing a quick EMV comparison for two risks:

- Risk A: 30% probability of a $100,000 impact  
- Risk B: 60% probability of a $20,000 impact

Which statement is correct?

A) Risk A has a higher EMV ($30,000 vs. $12,000).  
B) Risk B has a higher EMV ($60,000 vs. $20,000).  
C) Both have the same EMV ($30,000 each).  
D) EMV cannot be calculated without a risk register.

**Answer: A**

**Explanation**: EMV = Probability × Impact. Risk A: 0.30 × 100,000 = 30,000. Risk B: 0.60 × 20,000 = 12,000.

## Question 5

**Domain**: Process (41%)  
**ECO Task**: Develop risk responses

A team is considering a new, unproven technology platform. The risk is that the platform may not meet performance requirements, causing major rework late in the project. The project manager recommends switching to a proven platform, even though it costs more.

Which response strategy is this?

A) Avoid  
B) Mitigate  
C) Accept  
D) Enhance

**Answer: A**

**Explanation**: Avoidance changes the plan to eliminate the risk source (e.g., choosing a proven alternative instead of an unproven platform).

## Question 6

**Domain**: Process (41%)  
**ECO Task**: Manage opportunities

During vendor negotiations, you discover a time-limited opportunity: if you consolidate orders across departments this week, the vendor will guarantee a volume discount that will free up budget for higher-quality finishes.

Which opportunity response strategy BEST fits?

A) Exploit  
B) Enhance  
C) Accept  
D) Transfer

**Answer: A**

**Explanation**: Exploit means taking action to ensure the opportunity occurs (e.g., consolidating orders and negotiating now to lock in the discount). Enhance would increase probability/impact without guaranteeing it.

## Question 7

**Domain**: Process (41%)  
**ECO Task**: Plan reserves and manage residual risk

Which statement BEST describes the difference between contingency reserves and management reserves?

A) Both are included in the cost baseline and can be used without approval.  
B) Contingency reserves address identified risks and are included in the cost baseline; management reserves cover unknowns and typically require management approval.  
C) Management reserves are for quality defects; contingency reserves are for schedule delays only.  
D) Contingency reserves are only used on agile projects.

**Answer: B**

**Explanation**: Contingency reserves are planned responses to identified risks and are part of the baseline. Management reserve is held for unknown unknowns and is not part of the baseline.

## Question 8

**Domain**: People (33%)  
**ECO Task**: Escalate issues appropriately

A cross-team dependency issue is blocking progress. The impacted teams cannot resolve it because it requires a policy exception that only the sponsor can authorize.

What is the BEST next action?

A) Ask the teams to work around the policy without escalation to protect the schedule.  
B) Defer the decision until the next steering committee meeting, even if work stops.  
C) Escalate the issue with a clear description, options, and a recommendation.  
D) Convert the issue back into a risk and monitor it.

**Answer: C**

**Explanation**: When an issue requires authority beyond the team, escalation is appropriate. Strong escalation includes the problem, options, and a recommendation to enable timely decision-making.

## Question 9

**Domain**: Business Environment (26%)  
**ECO Task**: Manage and control changes

Midway through a predictive project, a stakeholder requests a new reporting feature that was not included in the approved scope baseline. At the same time, pilot users express anxiety about adopting the new system and begin resisting training.

Which approach BEST addresses both needs?

A) Treat both as scope changes and submit them to the change control board.  
B) Treat the feature request through scope change control and address user resistance through organizational change management activities.  
C) Skip formal change control to keep the schedule, and focus only on user training.  
D) Pause development until users accept the change, then revisit scope.

**Answer: B**

**Explanation**: The feature request is a scope change that should follow formal change control in predictive contexts. User resistance is a people-adoption challenge and requires OCM (communication, training, coaching, stakeholder engagement).

## Question 10

**Domain**: People (33%)  
**ECO Task**: Sustain adoption and performance

After rollout, early usage is strong, but three months later adoption starts slipping and people return to old processes. Training was completed and initial support was provided.

Which ADKAR element is MOST directly missing?

A) Awareness  
B) Knowledge  
C) Ability  
D) Reinforcement

**Answer: D**

**Explanation**: Reinforcement is what makes change stick: recognition, follow-through, process updates, accountability, and addressing backsliding quickly.
