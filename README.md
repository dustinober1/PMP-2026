## Project Overview

This guide is structured as a series of Markdown-based chapters, offering a deep dive into the three critical domains of the PMP Examination Content Outline (ECO):

*   **People (33%):** Leading teams, managing conflict, supporting virtual teams, and mentoring.
*   **Process (41%):** Managing communications, risks, stakeholders, scope, schedule, and cost in predictive, agile, and hybrid environments.
*   **Business Environment (26%):** Compliance, value delivery, organizational change, and supporting organizational strategy.

## Repository Structure

The content is organized into chapters, following a logical progression from foundational concepts to advanced application.

*   **Foundational Chapters (1-4):** Single-file overviews of the exam and core methodologies.
*   **Modular Chapters (5-19):** Deep dives into specific knowledge areas, split into sub-sections for easier reading.
    *   Includes **Knowledge Checks** at the end of modular chapters to reinforce learning.
