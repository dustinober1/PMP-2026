# PMP Exam Study Guide (July 2026 Update)

Welcome to the **PMP-2026** repository. This project serves as a comprehensive, open-source study guide designed to assist project managers in preparing for the Project Management Professional (PMP)® certification exam, specifically targeting the **July 2026** exam update.

## Project Overview

This guide is structured as a series of Markdown-based chapters, offering a deep dive into the three critical domains of the PMP Examination Content Outline (ECO):

*   **People (33%):** Leading teams, managing conflict, supporting virtual teams, and mentoring.
*   **Process (41%):** Managing communications, risks, stakeholders, scope, schedule, and cost in predictive, agile, and hybrid environments.
*   **Business Environment (26%):** Compliance, value delivery, organizational change, and supporting organizational strategy.

## Repository Structure

The content is organized into chapters, following a logical progression from foundational concepts to advanced application.

*   **Foundational Chapters (1-4):** Single-file overviews of the exam and core methodologies.
*   **Modular Chapters (5-19):** Deep dives into specific knowledge areas, split into sub-sections for easier reading.
    *   Includes **Knowledge Checks** at the end of modular chapters to reinforce learning.
*   **AI Essentials (Chapter 20):** Practical guidance on using AI responsibly in project work and exam prep.
*   **Practice Exams (Chapter 21):** Full-length practice questions and answers.
*   **Appendices (Chapter 98):** Key formulas, definitions, and sources.

## Key Features

*   **Scenario-Based Learning:** The guide follows three consistent project scenarios to illustrate concepts in practice:
    *   *Predictive:* An office renovation project.
    *   *Agile:* An expense reporting software development.
    *   *Hybrid:* A global transformation program.
*   **AI-Integrated Content:** Core AI concepts are introduced in Chapter 5 (data, ethics, emerging technologies) and expanded in **Chapter 20 – AI Essentials for Project Professionals**, with practical guidance on using AI tools responsibly in real projects and exam preparation.
*   **PMI-Aligned:** All content is strictly aligned with the *PMBOK® Guide*, *Agile Practice Guide*, and *Process Groups: A Practice Guide*.
*   **Practical Focus:** Structure follows a "Concept → Practical Example → Scenario Application" flow.

## Navigation Guide

This guide includes extensive cross-referencing and navigation aids to help you understand how concepts connect:

### Cross-Reference System
- **Related Topics sections:** Found at the end of major chapter sections, linking to related concepts in other chapters
- **Bidirectional linking:** Appendix entries link back to chapters, and chapters link to appendix definitions
- **Consistent formatting:** All internal links use standardized Markdown format for easy recognition

### Key Reference Documents
*   **[Appendix A – Key Formulas and Definitions](Chapter 98/Appendix A – Key Formulas and Definitions.md):** Comprehensive formula reference with worked examples, organized by knowledge area
*   **[Appendix C – Tools and Artifacts Index](Chapter 98/Appendix C – Tools and Artifacts Index.md):** Alphabetical index of all tools and techniques with descriptions and chapter locations
*   **[Concept Map](Study-Aids/Concept-Map.md):** Visual representation showing how concepts relate across the three exam domains

### Effective Navigation Tips
1. **Start with the outline:** Use Chapter 0/00-Outline.md to understand the overall structure
2. **Follow cross-references:** When you see a "Related Topics" section, explore the linked concepts to build connections
3. **Use the indexes:** Search Appendix C for specific tools or techniques you encounter in practice questions
4. **Reference formulas:** Link directly from chapter content to worked examples in Appendix A
5. **Track scenarios:** Use the Scenario Index to see how the three main scenarios (Office Renovation, Expense System, Transformation Program) illustrate different concepts
6. **Leverage the concept map:** Visualize relationships between topics, especially when studying cross-domain concepts

### Search and Discovery
- Use your editor's search function to find specific terms across all chapters
- Look for "Knowledge Check" sections to test understanding after each major topic
- Follow scenario references to see practical applications of theoretical concepts
- Use domain tags in practice questions to focus on specific exam areas
