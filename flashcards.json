          "front": "What does the PM Mindset of Integration mean?",
          "back": "Recognizing that the Big 6 concepts are interconnected. A risk materializes, forcing scope change, which triggers stakeholder concern about quality. The PM uses data and ethical conduct to facilitate transparent resolution."
        },
        {
          "front": "How does Quality relate to the Triple Constraint?",
          "back": "Quality is often called the fourth constraint. Changes in Scope, Schedule, or Cost impact Quality. A PM must balance delivering value ('Fit for Purpose') with meeting ESG and sustainability standards."

          "front": "What is the relationship between Stakeholders and Risk?",
          "back": "Stakeholders can create risks (conflicting priorities, unrealistic expectations). They also have influence over risk mitigation. Stakeholder analysis is a risk identification technique."

        {
          "front": "How should Data inform decision-making?",
          "back": "Be data-informed, not data-driven. Use metrics as a key input combined with context, judgment, and experience. Never blindly follow the numbers; always ask 'Why?' before reacting to metrics."

          "front": "How do Ethics and Professional Conduct apply in project management?",
          "back": "The PMI Code of Ethics has four pillars: Responsibility (own your decisions), Respect (value others), Fairness (impartial decisions), and Honesty (communicate truthfully). Ethics always trumps efficiency or profit."

        {
          "front": "What is the Systems Thinking approach in project management?",
          "back": "Recognizing that projects exist within complex systems. Changing one part affects other parts. PMs must understand how their project connects to organizational strategy, other projects, and the broader environment."
        },
        {
          "front": "How do the Big 6 concepts interact in a real project scenario?",
          "back": "Example: A schedule delay (constraint) emerges due to quality defects (quality). A key stakeholder (stakeholder) raises concerns. You use data analysis to identify root cause and leverage ethical transparency to gain sponsor support for corrective action."
        },
        {
          "front": "What does 'Value Delivery' mean in the context of core concepts?",
          "back": "Value delivery means ensuring that the project's output (scope delivered) achieves the intended outcome (change realized) and benefits (strategic value). It requires integration of all Big 6 concepts to succeed."
        },
        {
          "front": "How should a PM approach a conflict between Cost savings and Ethical conduct?",
          "back": "Ethics always wins. If a cost-saving option involves unethical practices (poor labor conditions, data privacy violations), reject it. Explain the risks and propose compliant alternatives. You are accountable for the decision."

        {
          "front": "How do you calculate EAC (Estimate at Completion)?",

          "front": "What does TCPI (To-Complete Performance Index) tell you?",
          "back": "TCPI = (BAC - EV) / (BAC - AC). It shows the required efficiency needed to complete within budget. If TCPI > CPI, the project cannot meet budget without reducing remaining work."
        },
        {
          "front": "What is the relationship between Lagging and Leading indicators?",
          "back": "Lagging indicators measure outcomes after the fact (final cost, items delivered). Leading indicators predict future performance (velocity trends, team morale, risk exposure). PMs use leading indicators to be proactive."

        {
          "front": "Give an example of a vanity metric and why it's misleading.",
          "back": "Lines of Code (LOC) - More code doesn't mean better code. Better metric: Story points completed. Vanity metrics look impressive but don't correlate with actual project success."

          "front": "What is the 'human in the loop' principle for AI in project management?",
          "back": "AI is a tool, not a replacement for judgment. The PM must verify AI outputs, provide domain expertise, check for bias, and make final decisions. The PM owns accountability, not the AI."
        },

          "front": "What are the four types of AI used in project management?",
          "back": "1. Generative AI (GenAI) - Creates new content (drafting documents)\n2. Predictive AI - Forecasts future outcomes (schedule predictions)\n3. Natural Language Processing (NLP) - Understands human language (sentiment analysis)\n4. Machine Learning (ML) - Learns patterns from data (anomaly detection)"

          "back": "Do not put sensitive data into public AI models. Use enterprise AI tools only. Anonymize data. Follow organizational policies. Violations of data privacy are ethics breaches and legal violations."

          "front": "How do cultural differences affect ethical standards on global projects?",
          "back": "Respect cultural differences in communication style, but PMI Code of Ethics standards are universal and non-negotiable. When in doubt, disclose. Document cross-cultural decisions for clarity."
