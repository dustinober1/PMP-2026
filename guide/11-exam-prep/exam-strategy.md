# 11.1 Exam Strategy & Test-Taking

The PMP exam is not just a test of what you *know*—it's a test of how you **reason**. In 2026, the exam is approximately 50% Agile/Hybrid and 50% Predictive. Success requires shifting your mindset to match the PMI philosophy.

## 🧠 The PMI Mindset (The "Golden Rules")
When in doubt, apply these three rules to every question:
1. **Never Escalate Immediately**: If there's a problem, the PM should usually try to solve it (or analyze it) first before going to the Sponsor.
2. **Analysis First, Action Second**: If something happens, the first step is almost always to "Analyze the impact" or "Review the plan," not to "Update the baseline."
3. **Servant Leadership**: Always choose the answer that supports the team, removes blockers, and fosters collaboration.

## 🏎️ Time Management: The 240-Minute Race
The exam is divided into three sections (60, 60, and 65 questions). You get two optional 5-minute breaks.

| Section       | Questions | Recommended Time |
| :------------ | :-------- | :--------------- |
| **Section 1** | 1 - 60    | 0 - 75 min       |
| **Section 2** | 61 - 120  | 75 - 150 min     |
| **Section 3** | 121 - 185 | 150 - 240 min    |

::: tip 💡 Strategy: The "Review" Lock
Once you finish a section and start your break, you **cannot** go back to those questions. Review your flagged questions before you hit "Submit Section."

## 🔍 Decoding Scenario Questions
Most questions will be 3-5 sentences long. Use the **Reverse Reading** technique:

1. **Read the Last Sentence First**: This is the actual question (e.g., "What should the PM do first?").
2. **Read the Scenario**: Now you know what keywords to look for (Agile vs. Waterfall, Stakeholder vs. Team).
3. **Eliminate 2 Options**: Usually, two answers are obviously wrong (aggressive, passive, or factually incorrect).
4. **Choose the "Best" Remaining**: Between the last two, choose the one that moves the project forward or empowers the team.

## 🛠️ Elimination Techniques
Avoid these "Red Flags" in answer choices:
- "Assign a new task to a specific person" (PMs should facilitate, not just dictate).
- "Stop the project immediately."
- "Request more budget" (Before analyzing if you can optimize existing resources).
- "Ignore the issue because it is minor."

<div class="study-tip">
  <strong>📝 Exam Insight:</strong> If a question doesn't specify if the project is Agile or Waterfall, look for keywords like "Sprint," "Backlog," or "Scrum Master" (Agile) vs. "Baseline," "Phase Gate," or "Work Package" (Predictive). If no keywords exist, assume a <strong>Hybrid</strong> approach.
