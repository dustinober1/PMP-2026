# 4.1 – Stakeholder Identification and Analysis

## 4.1.1 Introduction

Stakeholders are individuals, groups, or organizations that can affect or be affected by your project. Effective stakeholder management begins with thorough identification and analysis—you can't engage stakeholders you don't know about.

::: tip Key Insight
**Unknown stakeholders are a risk**. A stakeholder you discover late in the project can derail your work with new requirements, objections, or resistance.

## 4.1.4 Stakeholder Register

### What Is a Stakeholder Register?

The stakeholder register is a project document that identifies stakeholder information:

| Element                 | Description                                      |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Name and role**       | Who is the stakeholder                           |
| **Contact information** | How to reach them                                |
| **Organization**        | Where they work                                  |
| **Requirements**        | What they need from the project                  |
| **Expectations**        | What they expect to happen                       |
| **Influence**           | Their power over the project                     |
| **Interest**            | Their level of concern about the project         |
| **Classification**      | Category (internal/external, supporter/resistor) |
| **Engagement strategy** | How to work with them                            |

### Maintaining the Register

- Update when new stakeholders are identified
- Revise classifications as engagement evolves
- Review periodically (especially at phase transitions)
- Treat sensitive information appropriately

## 4.1.5 Stakeholder Analysis Tools

### Power/Interest Grid

Classify stakeholders by their **power** (ability to influence) and **interest** (level of concern):

```
                    Interest
              Low           High
         ┌─────────────┬─────────────┐
   High  │   Keep      │   Manage    │
 Power   │  Satisfied  │   Closely   │
         ├─────────────┼─────────────┤
   Low   │   Monitor   │    Keep     │
         │    (Min)    │  Informed   │
         └─────────────┴─────────────┘
```

| Quadrant                                       | Strategy                                    |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Manage Closely** (High Power, High Interest) | Close collaboration, frequent communication |
| **Keep Satisfied** (High Power, Low Interest)  | Keep happy without overwhelming with detail |
| **Keep Informed** (Low Power, High Interest)   | Regular updates, address concerns           |
| **Monitor** (Low Power, Low Interest)          | Minimal effort, watch for changes           |

### Salience Model

Classifies stakeholders by three attributes:

| Attribute      | Description                          |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Power**      | Ability to impose their will         |
| **Legitimacy** | Appropriateness of their involvement |
| **Urgency**    | Time-sensitivity of their claims     |

Stakeholders with more attributes deserve more attention.

### Stakeholder Cube

Extends the power/interest grid to three dimensions:
- Power (high/low)
- Interest (high/low)
- Attitude (positive/negative)

This helps distinguish between supportive and resistant stakeholders.

## 4.1.6 Engagement Assessment Matrix

### Current vs. Desired Engagement

Track where stakeholders are and where you need them:

| Engagement Level | Description                              |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Unaware**      | Doesn't know about the project           |
| **Resistant**    | Aware but opposed to the project         |
| **Neutral**      | Aware but neither supportive nor opposed |
| **Supportive**   | Aware and supportive                     |
| **Leading**      | Actively engaged in ensuring success     |

### Assessment Matrix Example

| Stakeholder | Unaware | Resistant | Neutral | Supportive | Leading |
| ----------- | ------- | --------- | ------- | ---------- | ------- |
| CFO         |         | C         |         | D          |         |
| IT Director |         |           | C       | D          |         |
| End Users   | C       |           |         | D          |         |
| Sponsor     |         |           |         |            | C/D     |

**C** = Current, **D** = Desired

### Using the Matrix

- Identify gaps between current and desired states
- Develop engagement strategies to close gaps
- Prioritize based on stakeholder importance
- Track progress over time

## 4.1.7 Stakeholder Risk Assessment

### Stakeholder-Related Risks

Consider risks arising from stakeholders:

| Risk Type               | Examples                              |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Resistance**          | Stakeholder actively opposes project  |
| **Disengagement**       | Key stakeholder becomes unavailable   |
| **Scope creep**         | Stakeholder keeps adding requirements |
| **Political**           | Stakeholders compete, causing delays  |
| **Change in personnel** | Sponsor leaves organization           |

### Mitigation Strategies

- Build relationships with multiple stakeholders (not just one champion)
- Document agreements formally
- Manage expectations proactively
- Monitor engagement levels
- Plan for stakeholder transitions
