## 🛠️ Communication Methods
You must select the most efficient method for each audience:

| Method          | What it is                                        | Best For...                            |
| :-------------- | :------------------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------- |
| **Interactive** | Multi-directional (Meetings, Calls, IM).          | Complex problems; building trust.      |
| **Push**        | Sent to specific recipients (Email, Memos).       | Routine updates; non-urgent docs.      |
| **Pull**        | Recipient accesses info (Portals, Wikis, Trello). | Large audiences; technical references. |

## 🧭 The Communication Flow
In 2026, managing "Noise" is harder than ever. Noise isn't just a bad Wi-Fi connection; it's **Cultural Barriers**, **Time Zone Friction**, and **Information Overload**.

### Communication Channels Formula
If you have $N$ people on your team, the number of potential channels is:
$$ \frac{N \times (N-1)}{2} $$
- **Why it matters**: If you add 2 people to a team of 4, you don't just add 2 more lines of communication; you jump from 6 channels to 15. Complexity grows exponentially!

## 📡 Modern Communication Technology
When choosing a tool (Slack vs. Email vs. Video), consider:
- **Urgency**: Does it need to be solved in real-time?
- **Stability**: Is the Wi-Fi reliable enough for video?
- **Ease of Use**: Will the stakeholder actually open the tool?
- **Sensitivity**: Does it need encryption or "Need to Know" access?
