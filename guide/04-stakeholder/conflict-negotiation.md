# 4.4 Negotiation & Decision-Making

Negotiation is a daily activity for project leaders—whether you are competing for high-performers, defending a budget, or resolving a scope dispute with a vendor. The 2026 PMP exam focuses on **Interest-Based Negotiation**.

## 🤝 Interest-Based Negotiation
Also known as "Principled Negotiation," this approach focuses on a win-win outcome by addressing underlying needs rather than surface-level demands.

## 🏛️ Decision-Making Models
As a facilitator, you must guide the group toward a decision method that fits the urgency and complexity of the problem.

*   **Unanimity**: 100% agreement. Ideal for core values but very slow.
*   **Consensus**: "I can live with it." High buy-in; no one will sabotage the outcome.
*   **Majority**: >50% agreement. Quick but can alienate the "losers."
*   **Plurality**: The largest group wins. Efficient for choices with many options.
*   **Autocratic**: One person decides. Used for emergencies or highly technical mandates.

::: info 🛠️ 2026 Focus: Collaborative Voting
For virtual teams, use **Low-Friction Voting Tools**:
- **Dot Voting**: Visual priority setting.
- **Fist of Five**: A quick gauge of consensus (5 = Full Support, 1 = Major Concern).
- **Roman Voting**: Thumbs up/down for rapid binary choices.

## 🧭 The PM's BATNA
Before entering any negotiation, you must know your **BATNA** (Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement).
- **Why?**: It gives you the "power of the walk-away." If a vendor's offer is worse than your BATNA, you cannot accept it.

<div class="study-tip">
  <strong>📝 Exam Insight:</strong> If a vendor is failing to meet requirements and a dispute arises, the BEST first step is <strong>Direct Negotiation</strong> between you and the vendor. Legal action or arbitration are last resorts that should only be used after internal negotiation fails.
