# 4.4 Negotiation & Decision-Making

Negotiation is a daily activity for PMs—whether you're negotiating for resources, scope, or budget. The PMP exam focuses on **Interest-Based Negotiation**.

## 🤝 Interest-Based Negotiation (Win-Win)
Also known as "principled negotiation," the goal is to find a solution that satisfies all parties' underlying needs.

| Principle                                | Advice for the PM                                                    |
| :--------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Separate the People from the Problem** | Don't make it personal. Focus on the project goal.                   |
| **Focus on Interests, Not Positions**    | Positions are "I want X." Interests are "I need to ensure security." |
| **Invent Options for Mutual Gain**       | Look for a "third way" that solves both interests.                   |
| **Use Objective Criteria**               | Base the decision on data, market rates, or industry standards.      |

## 🧭 Negotiation Tactics
- **Avoid "Hard" Bargaining**: This destroys long-term relationships.
- **Identify BATNA**: (Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement). Know your walk-away point.
- **Fairness**: Ensure the other party feels the process was just, even if they didn't get everything they wanted.

## 🏛️ Decision-Making Frameworks
When a team or stakeholder group is stuck, the PM must facilitate a decision:
- **Unanimity**: Everyone agrees (rare and slow).
- **Consensus**: Everyone can *live* with the decision; no one actively blocks.
- **Majority**: More than 50% agree.
- **Plurality**: The largest block agrees (even if not 50%).
- **Autocratic**: The PM decides (emergency use only).
