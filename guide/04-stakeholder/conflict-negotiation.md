# 4.4 Negotiation & Decision-Making

**ECO Task**: Manage conflicts

Negotiation is a daily activity for project leaders—whether you are competing for high-performers, defending a budget, or resolving a scope dispute with a vendor. The 2026 PMP exam focuses on **Interest-Based Negotiation**.

##  Interest-Based Negotiation
Also known as "Principled Negotiation," this approach focuses on win-win outcomes by addressing underlying needs rather than surface-level demands.

<ConceptGrid>
  <ConceptCard title="Focus on Interests">
    Distinguish "Positions" (what they say they want) from "Interests" (the underlying need they must solve).
  </ConceptCard>
  <ConceptCard title="Invent Options">
    Facilitate a "third way" that provides mutual gain, rather than simple compromise where both sides lose.
  </ConceptCard>
  <ConceptCard title="Objective Criteria">
    Base decisions on external standards (market rates, regulations) rather than a battle of wills.
  </ConceptCard>
  <ConceptCard title="Separate People">
    Attack the problem, not the person. Maintain trust even when the discussion is high-stakes.
  </ConceptCard>
</ConceptGrid>

##  The ZOPA and BATNA

<ConceptGrid>
  <ConceptCard title="ZOPA">
    **Zone of Possible Agreement**. The range where the buyer's and seller's acceptable limits overlap.
  </ConceptCard>
  <ConceptCard title="BATNA">
    **Best Alternative to Negotiated Agreement**. Your fallback plan. If a deal is worse than your BATNA, you walk away.
  </ConceptCard>
  <ConceptCard title="Reservation Point">
    The "Bottom Line"—the absolute worst acceptable outcome before you trigger your BATNA.
  </ConceptCard>
</ConceptGrid>

##  Conflict Resolution Techniques
The exam tests whether you choose a response that preserves **relationships** while resolving the **root cause**.

<ConceptGrid>
  <ConceptCard title="Collaborate">
    **Win-Win**. Deep problem-solving to meet both parties' needs. Best for strategic alignment.
  </ConceptCard>
  <ConceptCard title="Compromise">
    **Partial Win-Win**. Both sides give up something. Best for temporary fixes or quick deadlocks.
  </ConceptCard>
  <ConceptCard title="Force">
    **Win-Lose**. PM uses authority. Best for emergencies, safety issues, or compliance.
  </ConceptCard>
  <ConceptCard title="Smooth">
    **Lose-Win**. Downplay differences to maintain harmony. Best when the relationship matters more than the issue.
  </ConceptCard>
  <ConceptCard title="Withdraw">
    **Lose-Lose (Temp)**. Postpone the discussion. Best when emotions are high or more data is needed.
  </ConceptCard>
</ConceptGrid>

::: tip  Exam Insight
If a vendor is failing to meet requirements and a dispute arises, the BEST first step is <strong>Direct Negotiation</strong> between you and the vendor. Legal action or arbitration are last resorts that should only be used after internal negotiation fails.
