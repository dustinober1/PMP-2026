## 🏗️ Building Trust
Trust is the currency of project management. In 2026, transparency is your best tool.

## 🚦 Handling Difficult Stakeholders
Resistance is often just unmanaged fear.
1. **Identify the root cause**: Is it fear of job loss? Lack of trust in management?
2. **Consult them early**: People support what they help create.
3. **Engage the Sponsor**: If a high-power stakeholder is actively blocking, you may need the Sponsor to handle the political "heavy lifting."
