# 4.3 Active Engagement

Communication is the *act* of sending information; **Engagement** is the *result* of that information. It is the art of building and maintaining trust so that stakeholders actively support the project's vision.

## 🏗️ The Pillars of Trust
Trust is the currency of leadership. In the 2026 PMP mindset, transparency is your most effective tool for building long-term engagement.

## 🚦 Navigating Resistance
Resistance is usually a symptom of unmanaged fear or a loss of control.

| Strategy                | Action Plan                                                                          |
| :---------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Root Cause Analysis** | Is the resistance about the project, their job security, or a personal conflict?     |
| **Early Involvement**   | Bring resistors into the requirements phase or UAT. Focus on **Inclusion**.          |
| **WIIFM**               | Clearly communicate "What's In It For Me" from *their* specific perspective.         |
| **Sponsor Support**     | Use the Sponsor for "high-level" political alignment if a peer is blocking progress. |

::: info 🛠️ 2026 Shift: Continuous Validation
Forget the "one-time" sign-off. Modern engagement uses **Demos** and **Reviews** as continuous validity checks. If a stakeholder's needs haven't been met, you find out in two weeks, not two months.

## 📊 Managing Expectations
Expectation management is the #1 job of a PM. 
1.  **Define Done**: Ensure everyone has the same mental picture of the final outcome.
2.  **Regular Cadence**: Consistency in communication reduces anxiety and builds trust.
3.  **No Surprises**: The hallmark of a great PM is that no stakeholder is ever surprised by a major project event.

  <strong>📝 Exam Insight:</strong> If a stakeholder is unhappy with a deliverable, the answer is rarely "work harder." The correct answer is usually to <strong>increase the frequency of their involvement</strong> or <strong>update the Stakeholder Engagement Plan</strong> to provide more visibility.
