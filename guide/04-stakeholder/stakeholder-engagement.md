# 4.3 Active Engagement

Communication is the *act* of sending information; **Engagement** is the *result* of that information. It is the art of building and maintaining trust so that stakeholders actively support the project's vision.

## 🏗️ The Pillars of Trust
Trust is the currency of leadership. In the 2026 PMP mindset, transparency is your most effective tool for building long-term engagement.

## 🚦 Navigating Resistance
Resistance is usually a symptom of unmanaged fear or a loss of control.

| Strategy                | Action Plan                                                                          |
| :---------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Root Cause Analysis** | Is the resistance about the project, their job security, or a personal conflict?     |
| **Early Involvement**   | Bring resistors into the requirements phase or UAT. Focus on **Inclusion**.          |
| **WIIFM**               | Clearly communicate "What's In It For Me" from *their* specific perspective.         |
| **Sponsor Support**     | Use the Sponsor for "high-level" political alignment if a peer is blocking progress. |

::: info 🛠️ 2026 Shift: Continuous Validation
Forget the "one-time" sign-off. Modern engagement uses **Demos** and **Reviews** as continuous validity checks. If a stakeholder's engagement slips, you find out in two weeks, not two months.

## 🔄 Agile vs. Predictive Engagement
The exam will test your ability to adapt engagement based on the project life cycle.

| Feature | Predictive (Waterfall) | Adaptive (Agile) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Timing** | Heavy upfront (planning) + Milestones | Continuous (daily/biweekly) |
| **Key Event** | Monthly Status Report | Sprint Review / Demo |
| **Feedback** | Formal Change Request | Direct feedback on working software |
| **Relationships** | PM is the "Hub" managing all comms | Team speaks directly to Business Owners |

::: tip 🧠 Agile Mindset
In Agile, **Stakeholders are Participants**, not just observers. Invite them to the Daily Standup (as listeners) and the Sprint Review (as active feedback givers).
:::

## 📊 From Analysis to Action (Engagement Plan)
Stakeholder analysis tells you **who matters**. Engagement planning tells you **what you will do** to earn and maintain support.

### Engagement assessment (Current vs Desired)
This is the fastest way to spot where projects fail: the project needs someone to be *Supportive*, but they are currently *Resistant*.

| Stakeholder | Current | Desired | Your action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Compliance lead | Neutral | Supportive | Invite early review; clarify non-negotiables; agree on cadence |
| Dept head | Resistant | Neutral | 1:1 listening; clarify WIIFM; reduce perceived loss of control |
| Power user | Supportive | Leading | Empower as champion; include in demos/UAT; amplify feedback |

### Signs engagement is slipping (leading indicators)
- Stakeholders stop attending demos/reviews, response times increase, decisions stall, rumors escalate, or “side conversations” replace formal governance.

::: warning ⚠️ The Risk Connection
A **Resistant** stakeholder is a **Risk**. If you identify a high-power resistor, you must:
1.  Update the **Stakeholder Register** (to reflect the attitude).
2.  Update the **Risk Register** (to track the threat to project objectives).
3.  Update the **Issue Log** (if they are actively blocking progress).
:::

::: tip 🧠 Exam Pattern
When a stakeholder is unhappy, the best answers usually involve **direct engagement + plan updates** (Stakeholder Register, Engagement Plan, Communications Plan) before escalation.

## 📊 Managing Expectations
Expectation management is the #1 job of a PM. 
1.  **Define Done**: Ensure everyone has the same mental picture of the final outcome.
2.  **Regular Cadence**: Consistency in communication reduces anxiety and builds trust.
3.  **No Surprises**: The hallmark of a great PM is that no stakeholder is ever surprised by a major project event.

  <strong>📝 Exam Insight:</strong> If a stakeholder is unhappy with a deliverable, the answer is rarely "work harder." The correct answer is usually to <strong>increase the frequency of their involvement</strong> or <strong>update the Stakeholder Engagement Plan</strong> to provide more visibility.
