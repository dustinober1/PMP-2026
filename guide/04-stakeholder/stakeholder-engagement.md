### Tailoring by Stakeholder Type

Based on Power/Interest Grid analysis:

| Quadrant           | Strategy           | Activities                                                                 |
| ------------------ | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| **Monitor**        | Minimal touch      | Periodic check-ins, watch for changes in interest                          |

### Engagement Approaches

| Approach          | Description                 | When to Use                                          |

## 4.3.3 Building Trust

### Trust Equation

Trust = (Credibility + Reliability + Intimacy) / Self-Orientation

| Component                | Description              | How to Build                                      |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Credibility**          | Expertise, knowledge     | Demonstrate competence, admit what you don't know |
| **Reliability**          | Follow through           | Do what you say, meet commitments                 |
| **Intimacy**             | Safe to confide in       | Maintain confidentiality, show empathy            |
| **Self-Orientation** (÷) | Focus on self vs. others | Focus on stakeholder needs, not your agenda       |

### Trust-Building Actions

- Keep commitments, even small ones
- Communicate proactively, especially bad news
- Admit mistakes and take responsibility
- Be transparent about constraints and challenges
- Follow through on feedback and concerns
- Give credit to others
- Maintain confidentiality

## 4.3.4 Managing Expectations

### Why Expectations Matter

Stakeholder satisfaction = Perception - Expectations

If you deliver more than expected, stakeholders are satisfied. If you deliver less—even if you've done well objectively—they are dissatisfied.

### Expectation Management Strategies

| Strategy                        | Description                                      |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Clarify early**               | Understand and document expectations upfront     |
| **Align to reality**            | Adjust unrealistic expectations through dialogue |
| **Document agreements**         | Written confirmation prevents misunderstandings  |
| **Communicate constraints**     | Be honest about limitations                      |
| **Underpromise, overdeliver**   | Create margin for positive surprises             |
| **Address changes immediately** | When expectations shift, address quickly         |

### Handling Conflicting Expectations

When stakeholders want different things:

1. **Understand** each stakeholder's perspective and underlying needs
2. **Prioritize** based on project goals, sponsor direction, and constraint analysis
3. **Facilitate** discussion between stakeholders when appropriate
4. **Document** decisions and rationale
5. **Communicate** outcomes to all affected parties
6. **Escalate** if you cannot resolve at your level

### Types of Difficult Stakeholders

| Type            | Behavior                         | Engagement Strategy                           |
| --------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Disengaged**  | Doesn't respond, avoids meetings | Understand barriers, find what interests them |
| **Resistant**   | Actively opposes project         | Listen to concerns, address root causes       |
| **Interfering** | Overinvolved, micromanages       | Set boundaries, increase transparency         |

| **Volatile**    | Unpredictable, emotional         | Stay calm, document, build buffer             |
