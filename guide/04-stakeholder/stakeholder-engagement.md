  </ConceptCard>
  <ConceptCard title="Social Proof">
    Show that respected peers already support the initiative. "Others like you are already on board."
  </ConceptCard>
  <ConceptCard title="Authority & Scarcity">
    Leverage experts and clarify deadlines. Use sponsor endorsement to highlight unique opportunities.

    Connect project outcomes directly to the stakeholder's specific goals and pain points.
