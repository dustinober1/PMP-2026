# 4.1a Stakeholder Mapping

Identifying who your stakeholders are is the first step, but **mapping** them tells you where to spend your limited energy and political capital. Effective leaders use these models to prioritize their attention.

## 🗺️ The Power/Interest Grid
This is the most critical tool for the PMP exam. It helps you categorize stakeholders and determine the correct "strategy of service."

<div class="mapping-grid">
  <div class="mapping-card high-p-high-i">
    <div class="mapping-title">Manage Closely</div>
    <div class="mapping-subtitle">High Power / High Interest</div>
    <p>Your primary partners. Require high-touch, frequent, and proactive engagement.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="mapping-card high-p-low-i">
    <div class="mapping-title">Keep Satisfied</div>
    <div class="mapping-subtitle">High Power / Low Interest</div>
    <p>Keep them happy to prevent them from becoming a blocker or using their power negatively.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="mapping-card low-p-high-i">
    <div class="mapping-title">Keep Informed</div>
    <div class="mapping-subtitle">Low Power / High Interest</div>
    <p>Harness their enthusiasm; they are your "Advocates." Keep them in the loop on progress.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="mapping-card low-p-low-i">
    <div class="mapping-title">Monitor</div>
    <div class="mapping-subtitle">Low Power / Low Interest</div>
    <p>Requires the least effort. Watch for shifts in power or interest over time.</p>
  </div>

## 🎯 The Salience Model
For complex projects with large ecosystems, simple grids aren't enough. The **Salience Model** analyzes three overlapping attributes:

1.  **Power**: Their level of formal or informal authority.
2.  **Legitimacy**: Their legal or moral right to influence the outcome.
3.  **Urgency**: How quickly they require your attention.

::: tip 💡 2026 Shift: The Community Stakeholder
In 2026, **Legitimacy** and **Urgency** are rising in importance. A community group may have low formal power but high legitimacy regarding environmental impact. Ignoring them is a major strategic risk.

## 🧊 The Stakeholder Cube
The Cube adds a critical third dimension: **Attitude**.
- **The Supporter**: Empower them to champion the project.
- **The Neutral**: Move them toward support by showing project value.
- **The Resistant**: Listen to their concerns to mitigate potential sabotage.
