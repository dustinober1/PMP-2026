# 4.1a Stakeholder Mapping

**ECO Task**: Engage stakeholders

Identifying who your stakeholders are is the first step, but **mapping** them tells you where to spend your limited energy and political capital. Effective leaders use these models to prioritize their attention.

## 🗺️ The Power/Interest Grid

This is the most critical tool for the PMP exam. It helps you categorize stakeholders and determine the correct "strategy of service."

<div class="mapping-grid">
  <div class="mapping-card high-p-high-i">
    <div class="mapping-title">Manage Closely</div>
    <div class="mapping-subtitle">High Power / High Interest</div>
    <p>Your primary partners. Require high-touch, frequent, and proactive engagement.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="mapping-card high-p-low-i">
    <div class="mapping-title">Keep Satisfied</div>
    <div class="mapping-subtitle">High Power / Low Interest</div>
    <p>Keep them happy to prevent them from becoming a blocker or using their power negatively.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="mapping-card low-p-high-i">
    <div class="mapping-title">Keep Informed</div>
    <div class="mapping-subtitle">Low Power / High Interest</div>
    <p>Harness their enthusiasm; they are your "Advocates." Keep them in the loop on progress.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="mapping-card low-p-low-i">
    <div class="mapping-title">Monitor</div>
    <div class="mapping-subtitle">Low Power / Low Interest</div>
    <p>Requires the least effort. Watch for shifts in power or interest over time.</p>
  </div>

### Detailed Engagement Strategies by Quadrant

| Quadrant | Strategy | Actions | Frequency | Communication Style |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Manage Closely** | Partner | Joint planning, real-time access, co-decision | High (daily-weekly) | Interactive, collaborative |
| **Keep Satisfied** | Maintain | Status updates, consultations, quick response | Medium (weekly-biweekly) | Concise executive summaries |
| **Keep Informed** | Leverage | Regular updates, involve as advocates | Medium (weekly-monthly) | Detailed, inclusive |
| **Monitor** | Observe | General communications, watch for shifts | Low (monthly or less) | Broadcast communications |

## ✅ How to Place Stakeholders (Fast and Defensible)

On the PMP exam, "power" is not just job title—it is the ability to **influence decisions, resources, or acceptance**.

### Power Assessment Criteria

**Formal Power Signals:**
- Controls budget allocation or approval authority
- Can reassign people or change priorities
- Has hiring/firing influence over team members
- Owns governance gates or sign-off authority

**Informal Power Signals:**
- Has the sponsor's ear or executive relationships
- Controls critical technical knowledge or expertise
- Shapes organizational culture or opinion
- Has historical influence ("they've been here forever")

### Interest Assessment Criteria

**Direct Impact Indicators:**
- The project changes their KPIs, metrics, or performance reviews
- Their workflow, tools, or processes will change
- They have direct benefit or downside risk from the outcome
- They are accountable for outcomes the project impacts

**Indirect Impact Indicators:**
- Their team or department will be affected
- Budget or resources they control are involved
- Political capital or reputation at stake
- Future initiatives depend on this project's success

::: tip 🔎 Quick Calibration
If they can **stop** the project, treat them as **High Power**. If the project changes their day-to-day work or metrics, treat them as **High Interest**.
:::

### Dynamic Movement: Stakeholders Shift Quadrants

Stakeholder positions are not static. Common triggers for movement:

| Trigger | Typical Movement |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Promoted/Demoted** | Power changes; may move left/right |
| **Project scope affects them** | Interest increases; moves up |
| **Reorganization** | Power and interest may both shift |
| **Negative experience** | Interest increases (often negatively) |
| **Champion leaves organization** | May lose an ally in high-power quadrant |
| **Regulatory scrutiny** | External stakeholder power increases |

**Re-map when**: Sponsor/leadership changes, major scope change, re-orgs, vendor changes, regulatory scrutiny, or public/customer impact increases.

## 🎯 The Salience Model

For complex projects with large ecosystems, simple grids aren't enough. The **Salience Model** analyzes three overlapping attributes:

1. **Power**: Their level of formal or informal authority.
2. **Legitimacy**: Their legal or moral right to influence the outcome.
3. **Urgency**: How quickly they require your attention.

### The Seven Salience Types (Complete Reference)

<div class="salience-grid">
  <div class="salience-card latent">
    <div class="salience-type">Dormant</div>
    <div class="salience-attrs">Power Only</div>
    <p>Sleeping giant. Low engagement now but can become decisive if triggered. Example: Inactive board member who owns veto power.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="salience-card latent">
    <div class="salience-type">Discretionary</div>
    <div class="salience-attrs">Legitimacy Only</div>
    <p>Values/ethics stakeholders. No power or urgency, but deserve respectful inclusion. Example: Employee diversity groups, accessibility advocates.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="salience-card latent">
    <div class="salience-type">Demanding</div>
    <div class="salience-attrs">Urgency Only</div>
    <p>Loud but not influential. Manage expectations carefully. Example: Social media critics with no real leverage.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="salience-card expectant">
    <div class="salience-type">Dominant</div>
    <div class="salience-attrs">Power + Legitimacy</div>
    <p>Core governance stakeholders. Strong formal authority and right to influence. Example: Project sponsor, steering committee.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="salience-card expectant">
    <div class="salience-type">Dangerous</div>
    <div class="salience-attrs">Power + Urgency</div>
    <p>High-risk blockers who may act forcefully. Engage carefully, use objective criteria. Example: Union during contract negotiations.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="salience-card expectant">
    <div class="salience-type">Dependent</div>
    <div class="salience-attrs">Legitimacy + Urgency</div>
    <p>Need an advocate; pair with sponsor support. Example: Community affected by construction, accessibility users.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="salience-card definitive">
    <div class="salience-type">Definitive</div>
    <div class="salience-attrs">Power + Legitimacy + Urgency</div>
    <p>🔴 Top priority. All three attributes mean immediate, high-attention response. Example: Regulator with compliance deadline.</p>
  </div>
</div>

### Salience Model Decision Tree

```
Start: Does the stakeholder have Power?
├── YES: Do they have Legitimacy?
│   ├── YES: Do they have Urgency?
│   │   ├── YES → DEFINITIVE (Highest Priority)
│   │   └── NO → DOMINANT (High Priority)
│   └── NO: Do they have Urgency?
│       ├── YES → DANGEROUS (Careful Engagement)
│       └── NO → DORMANT (Monitor Closely)
└── NO: Do they have Legitimacy?
    ├── YES: Do they have Urgency?
    │   ├── YES → DEPENDENT (Advocate Needed)
    │   └── NO → DISCRETIONARY (Respectful Inclusion)
    └── NO: Do they have Urgency?
        ├── YES → DEMANDING (Manage Expectations)
        └── NO → NOT A STAKEHOLDER
```

::: tip 💡 2026 Shift: The Community Stakeholder
In 2026, **Legitimacy** and **Urgency** are rising in importance. A community group may have low formal power but high legitimacy regarding environmental impact. Ignoring them is a major strategic risk.

## 🧊 The Stakeholder Cube

The Cube adds a critical third dimension to the Power/Interest Grid: **Attitude**.

### Three Attitude States

- **Supportive (+)**: Actively wants the project to succeed
- **Neutral (0)**: Neither supporting nor opposing; waiting to see
- **Resistant (-)**: Actively or passively opposing the project

### Stakeholder Cube Strategies

| Power | Interest | Attitude | Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| High | High | Supportive | Champion: Empower as advocate, involve in decisions |
| High | High | Neutral | Convert: Demonstrate value, build relationship, invite input |
| High | High | Resistant | Priority Risk: Direct engagement, root cause discovery, sponsor involvement |
| High | Low | Supportive | Ally: Maintain with periodic executive updates |
| High | Low | Neutral | Monitor: Keep satisfied, prevent negative shifts |
| High | Low | Resistant | Danger Zone: Immediate attention, remove blockers |
| Low | High | Supportive | Advocate: Leverage enthusiasm, involve in testing/feedback |
| Low | High | Neutral | Inform: Regular updates to build connection |
| Low | High | Resistant | Contain: Monitor, limit influence, clarify facts |
| Low | Low | Any | Minimal: Broadcast comms only, watch for changes |

::: info 🧠 Using the Cube on the Exam
If a stakeholder is **High Power** and **Resistant**, the best answers usually involve **direct engagement**, **root-cause discovery**, and an **updated engagement plan** (not avoidance or bypassing).

## 📍 Influence Direction Model

Understanding how stakeholders are influenced—and who influences them—helps you design effective engagement chains.

### Influence Mapping Questions

1. **Who do they listen to?** (Their influencers)
2. **Who listens to them?** (Their influence reach)
3. **What sources do they trust?** (Data, experts, peers)
4. **How do they form opinions?** (Evidence, relationships, authority)

### Coalition Building Using Influence Maps

| Scenario | Influence Strategy |
| :--- | :--- |
| Need executive buy-in | Identify who the executive trusts; engage them first |
| Technical skeptic blocking | Find respected technical peer to advocate |
| Cultural resistance | Identify early adopters to create social proof |
| External stakeholder concern | Use sponsor or governance to provide formal backing |

## 📊 Practical Mapping Examples

### Example 1: Enterprise Software Implementation

| Stakeholder | Power | Interest | Attitude | Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| CIO (Sponsor) | High | High | Supportive | Manage Closely - Weekly 1:1, co-decision on major issues |
| CFO | High | Medium | Neutral | Keep Satisfied - Monthly summary, focus on ROI |
| IT Director | High | High | Resistant | Priority - Direct engagement, understand concerns |
| End Users | Low | High | Mixed | Keep Informed - Demo sessions, training, feedback loops |
| Vendor PM | Medium | High | Supportive | Partner - Daily coordination, issue escalation |
| Legal | Medium | Low | Neutral | Monitor - Involve only for contracts and compliance |

### Example 2: Construction Project

| Stakeholder | Salience Type | Priority | Engagement Approach |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Building Inspector | Definitive | Highest | Proactive scheduling, documentation ready |
| Community Association | Dependent | High | Advocate through sponsor, regular updates |
| Mayor's Office | Dominant | High | Formal briefings, ribbon-cutting involvement |
| Environmental Group | Dangerous | Medium-High | Objective data, documented compliance |
| General Contractor | Dominant | High | Daily coordination, contract management |
| Future Tenants | Discretionary | Low | Periodic updates, preview events |

## 🔄 When to Re-Map Stakeholders

Stakeholder mapping is a living activity. Re-run your analysis when:

- **Organizational changes**: Mergers, re-orgs, leadership changes
- **Project changes**: Major scope additions, timeline shifts, budget adjustments
- **Environmental changes**: Regulatory shifts, market changes, competitive moves
- **Relationship changes**: Trust broken, new relationships formed
- **Phase transitions**: Moving from planning to execution, execution to closure
- **Conflict emergence**: Any significant stakeholder dispute
