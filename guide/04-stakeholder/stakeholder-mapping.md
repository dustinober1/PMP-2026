# 4.1a Stakeholder Mapping

Identifying who your stakeholders are is the first step, but **mapping** them tells you where to spend your limited energy and political capital.

## 🗺️ The Power/Interest Grid
This is the most critical tool for the PMP exam. It helps you prioritize engagement based on two dimensions:

| Category       | High Interest                                                                  | Low Interest                                                    |
| :------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **High Power** | **Manage Closely**: Your primary focus. High-touch, frequent engagement.       | **Keep Satisfied**: Prevent them from becoming a blocker.       |
| **Low Power**  | **Keep Informed**: Harness their enthusiasm; they are your "Internal PR" team. | **Monitor**: Low effort. Watch for shifts in power or interest. |

## 🎯 The Salience Model
For complex projects with hundreds of stakeholders, the Power/Interest grid isn't enough. The **Salience Model** uses three attributes:
1. **Power**: Their level of authority.
2. **Legitimacy**: Their legal or moral right to be involved.
3. **Urgency**: How quickly they need a response.

::: tip 💡 2026 Shift: The Community Stakeholder
In 2026, **Legitimacy** and **Urgency** are rising in importance. A community group may have low formal power but high legitimacy/urgency regarding environmental impact. Ignoring them is a major risk.

## 🧊 The Stakeholder Cube
The Cube adds a third dimension: **Attitude**.
- Is the stakeholder a **Supporter**? (Help them help you).
- Is the stakeholder **Neutral**? (Try to move them to support).
- Is the stakeholder **Resistant**? (Minimize their ability to sabotage).

  <strong>📝 Exam Insight:</strong> If an exam scenario says a high-power stakeholder is unhappy because they weren't informed of a minor change, you likely failed to <strong>Keep them Satisfied</strong>. The first step is to <strong>analyze their communication requirements</strong> and update the <strong>Stakeholder Register</strong>.
