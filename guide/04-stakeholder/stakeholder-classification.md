# 4.1b Classification & The Register

Once identified and mapped, stakeholders must be formally documented. The **Stakeholder Register** is the central repository for all stakeholder intelligence.

## 📋 The Stakeholder Register
This document should be created as soon as the project is chartered and updated **continuously**.

| Section            | What to Include                                      |
| :----------------- | :--------------------------------------------------- |
| **Identification** | Name, Role, Organization, Contact Info.              |
| **Assessment**     | Key requirements, Expectations, Potential influence. |
| **Classification** | Internal/External, Upward/Downward/Outward/Sideward. |

::: warning 🔒 Privacy Alert
The Stakeholder Register often contains sensitive information (e.g., "This stakeholder is resistant due to internal politics"). In the 2026 PMP exam, you must ensure this document is **secured** and only shared with those who need it.

## 🧭 Direction of Influence
Classifying how a stakeholder relates to the Project Manager is key for the exam:
- **Upward**: Senior management, Sponsor, Steering Committee. (Require strategic summaries).
- **Downward**: The project team. (Require details and servant leadership).
- **Outward**: Vendors, Regulators, Customers. (Require contract-focused communication).
- **Sideward**: Fellow Project Managers, middle management. (Require resource negotiation).

## 📊 Engagement Assessment Matrix
This tool identifies the gap between where a stakeholder is and where you need them to be.
- **Unaware**: Don't know about the project.
- **Resistant**: Known and opposed.
- **Neutral**: Neither for nor against.
- **Supportive**: Helpful.
- **Leading**: Actively ensuring success.

  <strong>📝 Exam Insight:</strong> If a stakeholder's influence changes or a new stakeholder is discovered, your <strong>Stakeholder Register</strong> is the first thing you update. It is <em>not</em> a "one and done" plan.
