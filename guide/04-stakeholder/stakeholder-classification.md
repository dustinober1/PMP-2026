# 4.1b Classification & The Register

Once identified and mapped, stakeholders must be formally documented. The **Stakeholder Register** is the central repository for all stakeholder intelligence—their needs, their influence, and your strategy for managing them.

## 📋 The Stakeholder Register
This document is created during Initiation and must be updated **continuously** as the project evolves.

| Category           | Information Collected                                                 |
| :----------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Identification** | Name, Role, Organization, and Primary Contact Method.                 |
| **Assessment**     | Primary Requirements, Expectations, and Potential Influence.          |
| **Classification** | Internal/External, Power/Interest levels, and Direction of Influence. |

### What “good” looks like (PMP-ready detail)
Beyond “who they are,” strong registers capture what you need to **make decisions and prevent surprises**:
- **Decision authority**: What can they approve/reject? What is the escalation path?
- **Acceptance influence**: Whose opinion defines “done” or “usable”?
- **Engagement level**: Current vs desired (and why there is a gap).
- **Communication needs**: Channel, cadence, format, language/time zone, accessibility needs.
- **Primary success criteria**: What outcome matters to them (and what they fear losing).
- **Risks/issues sensitivity**: Topics that trigger urgency (budget, compliance, reputation, safety).

#### Lightweight register template (copy/paste friendly)
| Stakeholder | Role / Org | Power/Interest | Current → Desired | Key needs & concerns | Preferred comms | Engagement strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Sponsor | Exec | High/High | Supportive → Leading | ROI, timeline risk | Monthly 1:1 | Options + recommendation |

::: warning 🔒 Data Privacy & Ethics
The Stakeholder Register often containing sensitive "political" analysis. In the 2026 PMP exam, you must treat this as a **confidential** document. Unauthorized access can damage trust and sabotage engagement.

## 🧭 Direction of Influence
Knowing "where" a stakeholder sits in relation to you dictates the style of communication you use.

## 📊 Engagement Assessment Matrix
This tool identifies the "Engagement Gap"—where a stakeholder is versus where the project needs them to be for success.

*   **Unaware**: They don't know the project exists.
*   **Resistant**: They are aware but opposed to the change.
*   **Neutral**: Neither supportive nor opposed.
*   **Supportive**: Helpful and supportive of the project's goals.
*   **Leading**: Actively ensuring the project delivers value.

### Closing the engagement gap (practical actions)
| Current state | What it usually means | Best first moves |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Unaware** | No context; surprises likely | Build awareness with targeted messaging and a clear “why now” |
| **Resistant** | Fear, loss, or mistrust | 1:1 listening, clarify WIIFM, involve early, use sponsor strategically |
| **Neutral** | Competing priorities | Show value, clarify impact, reduce friction to participate |
| **Supportive** | Wants you to succeed | Invite feedback, make them visible advocates, keep them informed |
| **Leading** | Driving success with you | Empower decision-making, co-create outcomes, protect their time |

## Stakeholder Engagement Plan vs Communications Plan
These are related but not the same:

| Plan | Focus | Typical contents |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Stakeholder Engagement Plan** | Behavior + buy-in | Engagement gaps, tactics, ownership, measurement, escalation |
| **Communications Management Plan** | Information flow | What/when/how, audience, channels, cadence, feedback loops |
