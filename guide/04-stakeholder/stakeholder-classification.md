# 4.1b Classification & The Register

**ECO Task**: Engage stakeholders

Once identified and mapped, stakeholders must be formally documented. The **Stakeholder Register** is the central repository for all stakeholder intelligence—their needs, their influence, and your strategy for managing them.

---

##  The Stakeholder Register

This document is created during Initiation and must be updated **continuously** as the project evolves.

| Category           | Information Collected                                                 |
| :----------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Identification** | Name, Role, Organization, and Primary Contact Method.                 |
| **Assessment**     | Primary Requirements, Expectations, and Potential Influence.          |
| **Classification** | Internal/External, Power/Interest levels, and Direction of Influence. |

### What "good" looks like (PMP-ready detail)
Beyond "who they are," strong registers capture what you need to **make decisions and prevent surprises**:
- **Decision authority**: What can they approve/reject? What is the escalation path?
- **Acceptance influence**: Whose opinion defines "done" or "usable"?
- **Engagement level**: Current vs desired (and why there is a gap).
- **Communication needs**: Channel, cadence, format, language/time zone, accessibility needs.
- **Primary success criteria**: What outcome matters to them (and what they fear losing).
- **Risks/issues sensitivity**: Topics that trigger urgency (budget, compliance, reputation, safety).

##  Direction of Influence (Expanded)

Knowing "where" a stakeholder sits in relation to you dictates the style of communication you use.

<div class="dir-grid">
  <div class="dir-card">
    <div class="dir-title">Upward</div>
    <div class="dir-who">Sponsors, Executives, Board</div>
    <p>Focus on strategic value, ROI, and high-level risk summaries. Frame decisions as options with recommendations.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="dir-card">
    <div class="dir-title">Downward</div>
    <div class="dir-who">Project Team, Contributors</div>
    <p>Focus on servant leadership, technical details, removing blockers, and creating psychological safety.</p>

### Communication Styles by Direction

| Direction | Tone | Format | Content Focus | Don'ts |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Upward** | Confident, concise | Dashboard, 1-pager | Outcomes, risks, decisions needed | Don't bury issues; don't over-detail |
| **Downward** | Supportive, clear | Standups, 1:1s, team meetings | Tasks, context, recognition | Don't micromanage; don't withhold info |
| **Outward** | Professional, formal | Emails, contracts, SoWs | Deliverables, timelines, terms | Don't be informal; don't skip documentation |
| **Sideward** | Collaborative, reciprocal | Coffee chats, joint planning | Dependencies, shared problems | Don't compete; don't hoard resources |

##  Engagement Assessment Matrix

This tool identifies the "Engagement Gap"—where a stakeholder is versus where the project needs them to be for success.

### The Five Engagement States

*   **Unaware**: They don't know the project exists.
*   **Resistant**: They are aware but opposed to the change.
*   **Neutral**: Neither supportive nor opposed.
*   **Supportive**: Helpful and supportive of the project's goals.
*   **Leading**: Actively ensuring the project delivers value.

### Engagement Assessment Matrix Template

| Stakeholder | Unaware | Resistant | Neutral | Supportive | Leading | Notes |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| Sarah (VP Ops) | | | C | D | | Need training visibility |
| Mike (CIO) | | | | C | D | Champion needed |
| Legal Team | | | C | D | | Early contract review |
| End Users | C | | | D | | Awareness campaign first |

**Legend**: C = Current, D = Desired

### Closing the Engagement Gap (Expanded Strategies)

| Current State | What It Usually Means | First Moves | Advanced Tactics |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Unaware** | No context; surprises likely | Build awareness with targeted messaging and a clear "why now" | Involve in planning, demo early work |
| **Resistant** | Fear, loss, or mistrust | 1:1 listening, clarify WIIFM, involve early | Use sponsor strategically, address root fears |
| **Neutral** | Competing priorities | Show value, clarify impact, reduce friction | Personalize benefits, create easy participation |
| **Supportive** | Wants you to succeed | Invite feedback, make them visible advocates | Give ownership of outcomes, public recognition |
| **Leading** | Driving success with you | Empower decision-making, co-create outcomes | Protect their time, amplify their voice |

##  Stakeholder State Transitions

Understanding common state transitions helps you anticipate and prevent disengagement:

### Positive Transitions (What Drives Them)
| From → To | Enablers |
| :--- | :--- |
| Unaware → Neutral | Clear communication, personal relevance |
| Resistant → Neutral | Addressed concerns, visible listening, WIIFM |
| Neutral → Supportive | Demonstrated value, involvement in decisions |
| Supportive → Leading | Ownership, recognition, alignment with their goals |

### Negative Transitions (Warning Signs)
| From → To | Triggers |
| :--- | :--- |
| Leading → Supportive | Burnout, lack of recognition, excluded from decisions |
| Supportive → Neutral | Unmet expectations, communication gaps, scope creep |
| Neutral → Resistant | Perceived threat, broken promises, lack of WIIFM |
| Resistant → Active Saboteur | Ignored concerns, public embarrassment, escalation failures |

##  Internal vs External Stakeholder Management

| Aspect | Internal Stakeholders | External Stakeholders |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Authority** | Often within organizational hierarchy | Contractual or regulatory relationship |
| **Information Access** | Can access internal systems | Limited to shared/approved information |
| **Communication Style** | Can be more informal | Should be more formal and documented |
| **Relationship Duration** | Beyond current project | Often project-specific |
| **Escalation Path** | Up organizational chain | Contract management, legal |
| **Compliance** | Internal policies | External regulations, contracts |

---

##  Stakeholder Engagement Plan vs Communications Plan

These are related but not the same:

| Plan | Focus | Typical Contents | Primary Question |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Stakeholder Engagement Plan** | Behavior + buy-in | Engagement gaps, tactics, ownership, measurement, escalation | "How do we earn and maintain support?" |
| **Communications Management Plan** | Information flow | What/when/how, audience, channels, cadence, feedback loops | "How do we ensure the right info reaches the right people?" |

### When to Update Each Plan

| Trigger | Engagement Plan | Communications Plan |
| :--- | :---: | :---: |
| New stakeholder identified | ✓ | ✓ |
| Stakeholder attitude changes | ✓ | Maybe |
| Communication failure | Maybe | ✓ |
| Stakeholder disengaging | ✓ | Maybe |
| New communication tool available | | ✓ |
| Phase transition | ✓ | ✓ |
| Conflict emerges | ✓ | |

##  Stakeholder Metrics (2026 Focus)

| **Decision Velocity** | Time from request to decision | <1 week | 1-2 weeks | >2 weeks |
| **Escalation Frequency** | Issues requiring escalation | Rare | Occasional | Frequent |
| **Net Promoter Score** | Would they recommend the project? | 8-10 | 6-7 | <6 |

| :--- | :--- |
| Meeting attendance declining | Formal complaints filed |
| Response times increasing | Project blocked by stakeholder |
| Side conversations replacing governance | Stakeholder withdraws support publicly |
| Questions about project value | Budget or resources pulled |
