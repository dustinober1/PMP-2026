# 4.1 Stakeholder Analysis

"You can't manage what you haven't identified." Stakeholder analysis is the process of systematically gathering and analyzing qualitative and quantitative information to determine whose interests should be taken into account throughout the project.

## The PMP Mental Model (Continuous Loop)
Stakeholder analysis is not a one-time kickoff exercise. It is a cycle you repeat whenever the project environment shifts:

1. **Identify** stakeholders (including “shadow” stakeholders with informal power).
2. **Analyze** power, interest, influence, and attitude (supportive vs resistant).
3. **Prioritize** where to spend time and political capital.
4. **Plan** engagement + communications (how you build and maintain support).
5. **Monitor & Update** as roles, risks, scope, and priorities change.

### Inputs you’ll see in exam scenarios
- **Project Charter / Business Case**: Why the project exists and who sponsors value.
- **Org structure & governance**: Who can approve, block, or accelerate decisions.
- **Requirements / product vision**: Who defines “done” and accepts deliverables.
- **Agreements / vendors**: External stakeholders with contract leverage.
- **Regulatory / community constraints**: Legitimacy and urgency can outweigh formal authority.

### Outputs (what you update first)
- **Stakeholder Register**: The living ledger of stakeholder intelligence.
- **Engagement Assessment Matrix**: Current vs desired engagement.
- **Stakeholder Engagement Plan**: Actions to close engagement gaps.
- **Communications Management Plan**: The “what/when/how” of information flow.

::: tip 🧠 Exam Pattern
If the scenario says **new stakeholder**, **changed attitude**, **political conflict**, or **unclear decision authority**, the best “first” action is usually to **update the Stakeholder Register** and **reanalyze** before escalating or changing the plan.

## The Analysis Journey
Identifying stakeholders is more than just a list of names; it's about understanding the hidden power dynamics of the organization.

## 2026 Shift: Stakeholder Diversity
In the modern project environment, stakeholders are more diverse than ever. You must consider:
- **Digital Stakeholders**: AI owners, data privacy officers, and cybersecurity teams.
- **Global Stakeholders**: Different time zones, cultural holidays, and communication norms.
- **Sustainability Stakeholders**: ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) auditors and community impact groups.

::: tip 🔍 Pro Tip: The Shadow Stakeholder
The most dangerous stakeholder is the one you didn't find. Always ask your known stakeholders: *"Who else should I be talking to about this?"*
