- B) Push (email newsletter)
- C) Pull (project portal) ✓

- A) Increased by 4
- B) Increased from 15 to 45 ✓
- C) Doubled
- D) Increased from 30 to 100

### Question 5: Engagement Assessment Matrix

A stakeholder's current engagement level is "Resistant" but you need them to be "Supportive." What should you do FIRST?

- A) Escalate to the sponsor

### Question 6: Interest-Based Negotiation

You are negotiating with a vendor who insists on a higher price. Instead of arguing, you ask "What's driving that price?" and learn they need to cover specialized materials. You offer to provide the materials yourself. What negotiation technique is this?

- A) Positional bargaining
- B) Focusing on interests, not positions ✓
- C) Compromising
- D) Forcing

**Explanation**: By understanding their interest (covering costs), you found a creative solution that bypassed their position (high price). This is interest-based negotiation.

According to the Trust Formula, which factor appears in the denominator, meaning higher values DECREASE trust?

- A) Credibility
- B) Reliability
