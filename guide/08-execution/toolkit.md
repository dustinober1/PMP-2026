# 8.3 Tools & Templates (One-Stop Reference)

Use this page as a copy/paste toolkit for execution and value delivery scenarios. It’s designed to match how the PMP exam phrases problems (“what should you do first?”).

## 🧾 Issue Log (Copy/Paste Template)
Minimum fields that make issues actionable:

| Field | Example |
|---|---|
| **Issue ID** | I-023 |
| **Date raised** | 2026-01-12 |
| **Description** | Cloud environment access missing for 3 developers |
| **Type** | Impediment / Technical / Vendor / Stakeholder |
| **Impact (scope/schedule/cost/quality)** | Schedule: 2-day slip risk; Cost: idle time |
| **Urgency** | High |
| **Owner** | PM (or named resolver) |
| **Next action** | Escalate to infra lead; request same-day access |
| **Due date** | 2026-01-13 |
| **Status** | Open / In progress / Resolved / Closed |
| **Resolution summary** | Access granted; add onboarding checklist |
| **Related items** | Risk R-014, Change CR-005, Decision D-009 |

::: tip 💡 Exam shortcut
If the team is blocked, don’t “log and wait.” Log it, assign an owner, and **remove/escalate** the impediment immediately.

## 🧱 Impediment / Blocker Triage (60-Second Checklist)
Use this when a blocker surfaces during a standup or checkpoint:

1. **Clarify**: What is blocked and what is the smallest next step?
2. **Impact**: Who is blocked and for how long? What deliverable is at risk?
3. **Owner**: Who can fix it (team, vendor, functional manager, IT)?
4. **Escalation path**: Who has authority if the owner can’t resolve quickly?
5. **Decision**: What do you need (access, approval, funding, priority change)?
6. **Follow-up**: When will you check back (today, not next week)?

## 🔁 Change Request “Mini-Analysis” (Fast Template)
Use for predictive change control, or for hybrid governance decisions.

| Field | Example |
|---|---|
| **Request** | Add SSO login option |
| **Reason** | Security requirement from IT governance |
| **Options** | (A) Add now (B) Add next release (C) Defer |
| **Impact summary** | +2 weeks, +$30k, adds security testing |
| **Risks created** | Integration risk; vendor dependency |
| **Recommendation** | Add now; request schedule/budget change approval |
| **Decision needed from** | Sponsor/CCB |
| **Decision date** | 2026-02-01 |

::: info 🔍 PMP nuance
In agile delivery, “change” often means **backlog re-prioritization**. In predictive delivery, it often means **formal integrated change control**. In hybrid, you may do both.

## 📌 RAID Log (Risks, Actions, Issues, Decisions)
RAID is a simple “single source of truth” for execution.

| Type | What it captures | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Risk** | Uncertain event | Vendor may miss delivery date |
| **Action** | Planned work to reduce risk / improve outcome | Run pilot with 10 users |
| **Issue** | Current problem | Test environment unstable |
| **Decision** | A recorded choice and rationale | Choose AWS over Azure due to compliance |

::: tip 💡 Exam shortcut
When a scenario has confusion and rework, it’s usually missing a **decision log** (people keep re-litigating old decisions).

## 🧠 Lessons Learned Register (Lightweight Template)
Capture lessons weekly (or each sprint). Keep it short and usable.

| Field | Example |
|---|---|
| **Date / iteration** | Sprint 4 |
| **What happened** | Defects spiked after a rushed merge |
| **Root cause** | DoD didn’t require peer review for hotfixes |
| **Impact** | Rework + delayed demo |
| **Lesson** | Hotfixes must still follow minimum quality gates |
| **Action** | Update DoD; add “hotfix checklist” |
| **Owner** | Tech lead |
| **Status** | Open / Done |

## 🗓️ Execution Meeting Agendas (Ready-to-Use)

### Daily standup (15 minutes)
- What did we complete since last sync?
- What will we complete next?
- What is blocking us?
- Are priorities still correct?

### Weekly stakeholder status (15–30 minutes)
- Progress vs plan (high-level)
- Top risks/issues and what we’re doing
- Decisions needed (with options and impacts)
- Upcoming milestones/demo dates

### Sprint review / demo (30–60 minutes)
- Demo the increment (focus on outcomes)
- Confirm acceptance (Done or not Done)
- Capture feedback and backlog changes
- Align on release timing expectations

### Retrospective (30–60 minutes)
- What went well?
- What didn’t?
- What will we try next?
- What is the single most important improvement action?

## 📣 One-Page Status Report (Template)
Use this structure for executives and busy stakeholders:

- **Overall status**: Green / Yellow / Red (with 1-sentence reason)
- **This period**: Key accomplishments
- **Next period**: Top planned work
- **Risks**: Top 3 (owner + response)
- **Issues**: Top 3 (owner + next action)
- **Decisions needed**: 1–3 items (deadline + options)
- **Value signal**: Adoption/usage, demo feedback, defect trend (pick what matters)

---

## 🏁 Transition to Operations (Operational Readiness Checklist)
Use before go-live/handoff to keep value from collapsing after delivery.

- **People**: Training complete, champions/support staffed, roles/RACI confirmed
- **Process**: SOPs updated, escalation path defined, SLAs agreed, incident process ready
- **Technology**: Monitoring/alerts set, backups/rollback plan, access/provisioning ready
- **Knowledge**: Runbooks + troubleshooting docs available, known issues documented
- **Benefits**: Benefits owner confirmed, measurement cadence scheduled

## 🧭 Escalation Message (Copy/Paste)
Use when a blocker needs fast action and you want to be clear and respectful.

**Subject**: Blocker impacting delivery (decision needed by \<date/time\>)

**Context**: \<brief description\>  
**Impact**: \<who is blocked / what milestone is at risk\>  
**Requested action**: \<what you need from them\>  
**Options**: \<if applicable\>  
**Decision deadline**: \<date/time\>  
**Owner / follow-up**: \<name + when you’ll follow up\>
