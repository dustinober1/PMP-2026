# 8.1 Executing Project Work

Execution is where project leaders coordinate human talent and physical resources to create the deliverables. It requires balancing formal control with the need for high-speed collaboration.

## 🏗️ Leading the Flow
The way you "Direct and Manage Work" shifts based on the project's stability.

## 🧠 Knowledge Management
Projects produce two distinct types of value: **Deliverables** and **Knowledge**.

<div class="knowledge-grid">
  <div class="knowledge-card">
    <div class="knowledge-title">Explicit Knowledge</div>
    <p>Facts, blueprints, and data that can be written down and easily shared (e.g., Code, Manuals).</p>
  </div>
  <div class="knowledge-card">
    <div class="knowledge-title">Tacit Knowledge</div>
    <p>Experience, "know-how," and intuition. Shared through <strong>Social Interaction</strong> and <strong>Collaboration</strong>.</p>
  </div>
</div>

::: tip 💡 2026 Shift: Continuous Learning
Do not wait for the "End of Project" party to capture lessons. Update the **Lessons Learned Register** at every sprint retrospective or phase gate to avoid repeating mistakes in the very next work cycle.

## 📈 Data to Intelligence
A core PM skill is translating raw noise into actionable project communication.

1.  **Work Performance Data**: Raw observations (e.g., "300 lines of code written").
2.  **Work Performance Information**: Analyzed context (e.g., "300 lines written, which is 50 fewer than the sprint goal").
3.  **Work Performance Reports**: The final output (e.g., a Status Dashboard for Stakeholders).

## 🛠️ Execution Toolbox
- **Issue Log**: Your #1 tool for tracking current problems. **Always** update this as soon as a risk occurs.
- **Change Requests**: The formal "Gear Shift." Used when execution deviates from the plan.
- **Servant Leadership**: The most important "tool." Your job is to clear the path for the team.

  <strong>📝 Exam Insight:</strong> If a team member is blocked by a technical issue or an overbearing functional manager, the PM acting as a <strong>Servant Leader</strong> must prioritize removing that impediment. If you can't fix it yourself, escalate it.
