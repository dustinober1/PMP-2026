# 8.1 – Executing Project Work

## 8.1.1 Introduction

Project execution is where plans become reality. This phase involves leading and managing the project team, performing the work, and producing deliverables. Effective execution requires balancing multiple demands while keeping focus on project objectives.

::: tip Key Insight
