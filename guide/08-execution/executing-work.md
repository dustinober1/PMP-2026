# 8.1 Executing Project Work

Execution is where you lead the team to create the deliverables. It requires coordinating multiple workstreams, managing assets, and fostering a culture of continuous learning.

## 🏗️ Coordination by Methodology
The way you "Direct and Manage Project Work" depends on your chosen framework:

| Predictive (Waterfall)                                                                                                | Agile (Scrum)                                                                                  |
| :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Work Authorization System**: A formal process to ensure work starts at the right time, preventing premature starts. | **Daily Standups**: 15-minute time-boxed meetings to synchronize work and surface impediments. |
| **Status Meetings**: Periodic reviews of progress against the baseline.                                               | **Sprint Backlog**: The team self-organizes to complete committed items.                       |
| **Centralized Control**: The PM acts as the primary coordinator.                                                      | **Distributed Leadership**: The team is self-managing; the PM/Scrum Master removes blockers.   |

## 🧠 Managing Project Knowledge
Projects don't just produce widgets; they produce **knowledge**.
- **Explicit Knowledge**: Fact-based and easy to document (e.g., blueprints, code, manuals).
- **Tacit Knowledge**: Experience-based and hard to codify (e.g., "know-how," intuition, lessons learned).

::: tip 💡 2026 Strategy: Lessons Learned
Don't wait until the end of the project to capture lessons. In 2026, **Continuous Learning** is the standard. Use **Retrospectives** (Agile) or **Phase Reviews** (Predictive) to update the Lessons Learned Register constantly.

## 📈 Work Performance Flow
You must understand how raw data becomes a report:
1. **Work Performance Data**: Raw observations (e.g., "We spent $500 today").
2. **Work Performance Information**: Analyzed data with context (e.g., "We spent $500, which is $100 over budget for this task").
3. **Work Performance Reports**: Formatted communication for stakeholders (e.g., a "Red/Yellow/Green" status report).

## 🛠️ Common Execution Tools
- **Issue Log**: A living document to track present problems. 
- **Change Requests**: Formal proposals to modify the plan.
- **RACI Matrix**: Ensures everyone knows who is Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed for every task.
