# Chapter 8: Execution & Value Delivery

Execution is where strategy meets reality. In the 2026 PMP exam, a Project Manager doesn't just "execute tasks"—they **steward value**. Success is measured not just by a finished product, but by the meaningful outcomes it creates for the customer and the organization.

::: tip 🎯 PMP Exam Reality
Most exam scenarios are execution scenarios: blocked team members, changing stakeholder expectations, quality defects, vendor delays, and “small” change requests. The test is usually about **what you do first** to protect flow and value.

## 🚀 Driving Performance (Without Losing Value)
Execution is where you turn plans and backlogs into real deliverables. It requires balancing:

- **Discipline** (baselines, policies, governance, quality standards)
- **Adaptability** (feedback loops, fast decisions, removing blockers)
- **People leadership** (coaching, conflict resolution, stakeholder alignment)

### What this chapter makes you exam-ready for
- Removing **impediments** while protecting team focus (servant leadership)
- Turning noise into insight (work performance **data → information → reports**)
- Managing **issues, risks, and changes** without “death by a thousand cuts”
- Proving value via **outcomes, benefits, and adoption** (not just deliverables)

### High-yield artifacts and “first moves” (execution quick picks)
| If a question says… | Think… | Best first move |
|---|---|---|
| “A team member is blocked” | Impediment | Remove/escalate blocker immediately; update impediment/issue log |
| “A risk occurred” | Issue now | Execute response → log as issue → assess impact |
| “Stakeholder asks for a small change” | Change control | Triage the request; assess impacts; follow change process/backlog rules |
| “We met requirements but users are unhappy” | Validation gap | Re-engage users; clarify outcomes; adjust acceptance criteria/priorities |
| “Operations won’t accept handoff” | Transition risk | Close readiness gaps (training, support, documentation) before closure |

## 2026 Focus: Impediments + Value at Risk
On the exam, execution questions often hide a simple truth: **value is threatened** because flow is blocked, quality is slipping, or adoption is failing. Your job is to:

- **Clear the path**: Remove blockers fast (or escalate) so work can continue.
- **Protect the system**: Use logs, cadences, and policies so you don’t “wing it” under pressure.
- **Manage knowledge continuously**: Update the lessons learned register during execution, not after.
- **Adapt with intent**: Re-plan/re-prioritize when value delivery is at risk, using the right governance.
