# 8.4 Engagement & Procurements

Execution is not just about the team; it's about navigating the web of **Stakeholders**, **Communications**, and **Vendors**. This section covers the "people and contracts" side of execution.

## 🤝 Manage Stakeholder Engagement
This is the process of communicating and working with stakeholders to meet their needs, address issues, and foster appropriate involvement.

::: tip 💡 Planning vs. Execution
- **Plan Stakeholder Engagement**: "How *should* we interact with them?" (Strategy)
- **Manage Stakeholder Engagement**: "The actual conversation, email, or meeting." (Action)
:::

### Core Engagement Skills
- **Active Listening**: Hearing what isn't said (concerns about power, status, or job security).
- **Conflict Management**: Addressing resistance early before it hardens.
- **Political Awareness**: Understanding who influences whom.
- **Observation**: Noticing when a stakeholder disengages or becomes hostile.

### The "Engagement Level" Shift
Your goal is to move stakeholders from their current state to the desired state (defined in the plan).

| State | Description | Typical Execution Move |
|---|---|---|
| **Unaware** | Doesn't know about project | Send info; schedule briefing |
| **Resistant** | Aware and resistant to change | Listen to concerns; emphasize WIIFM (What's In It For Me) |
| **Neutral** | Aware but neither supports nor opposes | Engage to build support; prevent slip to resistant |
| **Supportive** | Aware and supportive | Keep informed; ask for small helps |
| **Leading** | Actively engaged in ensuring success | Leverage as a champion to influence others |

## 📢 Manage Communications
This is the execution of the Communications Management Plan—creating, collecting, distributing, storing, and retrieving information.

### The "4 Rs" of Execution Communication
1.  **Right Information**: Don't spam; summarize relevant data.
2.  **Right Time**: Before they hear rumors; on the planned cadence.
3.  **Right Audience**: Tailored to their interest and power.
4.  **Right Channel**: Email for record, call for urgency, face-to-face for conflict.

### Communication vs. Engagement
- **Communication**: Sending the status report.
- **Engagement**: Calling them to discuss the red flag in the status report.

::: warning ⚠️ Common Pitfall
Sending an email does not mean you have communicated. Communication only happens when the message is **received and understood**. Use feedback loops (ask questions) to verify understanding.

## 🛒 Conduct Procurements (Executing Contracts)
This process involves obtaining seller responses, selecting a seller, and awarding a contract.

### 1. Advertising & Bidder Conferences
- **Advertising**: Making the opportunity known (public lists, trade journals).
- **Bidder Conferences**: A meeting with *all* prospective sellers to ensure clear, common understanding.
    - **Rule**: If one vendor asks a question, the answer goes to **everyone**. No private advantage.

### 2. Proposal Evaluation
Using the *Source Selection Criteria* (defined in planning) to rate proposals.
- **Screening System**: Eliminating vendors who don't meet minimums (e.g., "Must have ISO certification").
- **Weighting System**: Scoring based on value (e.g., Tech 60% / Price 40%).

### 3. Negotiations
The goal is a **win-win** agreement, not squeezing the vendor. A bad deal for the vendor often leads to a failed project.
- **Items to negotiate**: Scope, schedule, price, responsibilities, authority, applicable law.
- **Project Manager's Role**: You may not be the lead negotiator (procurement/legal often leads), but you provide the technical scope and risk context.

### 4. Agreements (Contracts)
The contract is a legally binding document. Once signed, "I think we should do X" doesn't matter unless it's in the contract or added via formal change control.

## 🧱 Managing Vendors During Execution
Once the contract is signed, you enter **Control Procurements** (Monitoring & Controlling), but the daily *interaction* feels like execution.

- **Disputes**: Always start with the contract terms. If ambiguous, negotiate. If failed, use ADR (Alternative Dispute Resolution) before litigation.
- **Changes**: Vendor scope changes **must** go through formal procurement change control (contract amendment). You cannot just "ask" for more features without addressing the contract.

  <strong>📝 Exam Insight:</strong> If a stakeholder is unhappy, check the <strong>Stakeholder Engagement Plan</strong> first. If a vendor is underperforming, check the <strong>Contract</strong> first. The document dictates the authority.
