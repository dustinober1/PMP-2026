# 8.2 Value Delivery and Outcomes

In 2026, a project is only successful if it delivers **Value**. If you finish on time and under budget but the customer hates the product, you have failed.

## 🔗 The Value Chain
Understand the relationship between these four stages:

1. **Output**: The tangible thing created (e.g., A new mobile app).
2. **Outcome**: The change in state or behavior (e.g., Customers can now bank on their phones).
3. **Benefit**: The measurable improvement (e.g., 20% reduction in branch visits).
4. **Value**: The overall worth as perceived by the organization (e.g., Increased customer loyalty and market share).

::: warning 🎯 Focus on Outcomes
PMP questions will often try to trick you into focusing on the **Output** (the widget). Always look for the answer that protects the **Outcome** (the purpose).

## 🏗️ The Value Delivery System
Projects do not exist in a vacuum. They are part of a larger ecosystem:
- **Strategy**: Where the organization wants to go.
- **Portfolios**: High-level grouping to ensure we're doing the *right* work.
- **Programs**: Grouping related projects to achieve shared benefits.
- **Projects**: The specific actions that drive the change.
- **Operations**: The day-to-day business where the value is actually realized.

## 📈 Benefits Realization Management (BRM)
How do we ensure the benefits actually happen?
- **Identification**: Defining what "success" looks like at the start.
- **Execution**: Building the right stuff.
- **Transition**: Handing over the project to **Operations**.
- **Sustainment**: Ensuring the benefits stick (e.g., training users, supporting the product).

::: tip 💡 2026 Shift: The Handoff
A Project Manager's job is not over when the code is written. It is over when the **operational owner** accepts the deliverable and is ready to support it. Failed transitions = Zero value.

## ⚖️ Value-Based Trade-offs
When the project faces a crisis, use Value as your compass:
- **Scope vs. Value**: If a feature is late but adds no value, cut it.
- **Agile Value**: In Agile, we use the **Product Backlog** to constantly re-prioritize based on the highest value items.

  <strong>📝 Exam Insight:</strong> If a project is perfectly on track but the organizational strategy changes, the Project Manager must <strong>Raise the Issue</strong> and reassess the business case. Continuing a "successful" project that no longer adds value is a waste of resources.
