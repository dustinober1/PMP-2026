# Knowledge Check: Execution and Value Delivery

Test your understanding of project execution and value delivery concepts.

## Practice Questions

### Question 1: Output vs. Outcome

A project delivers a new customer portal. Six months later, customer satisfaction has increased by 15%. The increased satisfaction is best described as:

- A) An output
- B) A deliverable
- C) An outcome ✓
- D) A work package

**Explanation**: The portal is the output/deliverable. The increased customer satisfaction is an outcome—the change that results from using the output.

### Question 2: Work Performance Data

"Activity A is 75% complete" is an example of:

- A) Work performance report
- B) Work performance information
- C) Work performance data ✓
- D) Earned value

**Explanation**: Work performance data is raw observation. It becomes information when analyzed in context (e.g., "Activity A is behind schedule").

---

### Question 3: Value Delivery

A project finishes on time and on budget, but customers don't use the product. From a value perspective, this project is:

- A) A success because metrics were met
- B) A failure because no value was delivered ✓
- C) Partially successful
- D) Neutral

**Explanation**: Value delivery is about outcomes and benefits, not just scope/time/cost. If customers don't use the product, value is not delivered.

---

### Question 4: Benefits Realization

Who is typically responsible for realizing project benefits after the project closes?

- A) Project manager
- B) Project team
- C) Business owner/sponsor ✓
- D) PMO

**Explanation**: Benefits are realized in operations after project closure. The business owner/sponsor typically owns benefit realization, though the PM ensures proper transition.

---

### Question 5: Knowledge Management

Which type of knowledge is hardest to capture and share?

- A) Explicit knowledge
- B) Documented knowledge
- C) Tacit knowledge ✓
- D) Process knowledge

**Explanation**: Tacit knowledge is personal, experiential knowledge that's difficult to codify. It's best shared through mentoring, discussion, and observation.

---

### Question 6: Project Success

According to modern project management, project success should be measured by:

- A) On-time, on-budget completion
- B) Stakeholder sign-off
- C) Deliverables meeting specifications
- D) Value delivered to stakeholders ✓

**Explanation**: The 2026 exam emphasizes value delivery. Success is measured by whether the project achieves its intended outcomes and creates value.

---

### Question 7: Transition Planning

When should transition planning to operations begin?

- A) After project closure
- B) During the closing phase
- C) During project planning ✓
- D) Only if requested

**Explanation**: Transition planning should begin during planning to ensure operations is ready to receive and sustain deliverables. Late planning risks poor handoffs.

---

### Question 8: Change Implementation

After an approved change is implemented, the project manager should:

- A) Archive the change request
- B) Verify the change achieved its intended result ✓
- C) Move on to the next activity
- D) Wait for stakeholder feedback

**Explanation**: After implementing a change, verify it worked as intended. This closes the loop on change control.

---

### Question 9: Benefits vs. Value

Benefits are:

- A) The same as project outputs
- B) Measurable improvements from outcomes ✓
- C) Financial metrics only
- D) Deliverables produced

**Explanation**: Benefits are measurable improvements (reduced costs, increased satisfaction, improved performance) that result from outcomes (changes in behavior or condition).

---

### Question 10: Execution Principle

During agile execution, which principle is emphasized?

- A) Follow the plan exactly
- B) Deliver comprehensive documentation
- C) Deliver working product frequently ✓
- D) Complete all planning first

**Explanation**: Agile emphasizes frequent delivery of working product. This enables feedback, learning, and value delivery throughout the project.
