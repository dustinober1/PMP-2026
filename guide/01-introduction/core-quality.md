# 1.4c – Quality: Ensuring Deliverables Solve the Problem

Sarah realizes: *A project can come in on time and on budget and still fail if the deliverable does not actually work or does not solve the real problem.*

## 1.4c.1 What Is Quality?

Quality has two classic definitions:

1. **Conformance to requirements**: Does the deliverable meet the stated requirements?
2. **Fitness for use**: Does it actually solve the customer's problem?

**You need both.** Meeting specifications is useless if the result doesn't help the user.

## 1.4c.2 Quality Management Approaches

### In Predictive Contexts
Quality is managed through:
- **Detailed specifications**: Upfront clarity.
- **Acceptance criteria**: Clear "done" definitions for each phase.
- **Inspections**: Checking work against the spec as it completes.
- **Defect management**: Prioritizing and fixing issues before sign-off.

### In Agile Contexts
Quality is continuous:
- **Definition of Done (DoD)**: Shared standards for every feature.
- **Continuous testing**: Automated tests, daily code reviews, pair programming.
- **User feedback loops**: Sprint demos provide immediate quality signals.
- **Continuous improvement**: Retrospectives identify and fix process gaps.

## 1.4c.3 Quality vs. Value

Quality for the sake of quality is not enough. The deliverable must deliver **value**.

- If a feature meets the spec but users find it too complex to use, it has high conformance but low value.
- Project Managers must test not just technical functionality, but the **outcome** for the user.

## 1.4c.4 Quality Trade-offs

- **Schedule vs. Quality**: Rushing often breeds "technical debt"—bugs that must be fixed later at higher cost.
- **Scope vs. Quality**: It's better to deliver fewer features that work perfectly than many that are buggy.
- **Cost vs. Quality**: Cutting testing resources may save money now but cost more in rework and reputation later.

## 1.4c.5 Standards and Compliance

Quality also includes meeting legal and organizational standards:
- **Regulatory compliance**: Building codes, data privacy laws (GDPR), safety standards.
- **Industry standards**: Specific certifications or best practices (ISO, NEC).
- **Auditability**: Maintaining records to prove quality and compliance.

## 1.4c.6 On the Exam: Quality Scenarios

**Common Patterns:**
- A team member suggests skipping testing to save time. (**Action**: Investigate risks and refuse to cut quality without a formal trade-off decision).
- A deliverable meets the spec but isn't helpful. (**Action**: Engage users and adjust scope/approach).

**Good Answers:**
- Identify root causes of defects.
- Balance short-term speed with long-term stability.
- Use data (defect rates, test coverage) to inform decisions.

::: warning Warning
Never "ship and pray." Quality issues discovered by the customer are exponentially more expensive to fix than those found during production.
