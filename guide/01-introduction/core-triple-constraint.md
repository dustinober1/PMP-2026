# 1.4b – Scope, Schedule, and Cost: The Triple Constraint

Sarah quickly learns that scope, schedule, and cost are interconnected. Every project has constraints on all three, and trade-offs are unavoidable. The relationship between these three has evolved as organizations adopt agile and hybrid approaches.

## 1.4b.1 The Classic Triple Constraint

In traditional project management, the "triple constraint" is:

- **Scope**: What will be delivered?
- **Schedule**: When will it be delivered?
- **Cost**: How much will it cost?

The classic view: **If you fix two of these, the third is determined.**

- Fix scope and schedule → cost is determined (spend whatever it takes)
- Fix cost and schedule → scope is determined (deliver only what fits)
- Fix cost and scope → schedule is determined (takes as long as it takes)

## 1.4b.2 Modern View: Constraints and Priorities

- **Predictive projects**: The triple constraint holds strongly. Scope, schedule, and cost are baseline constraints.
- **Agile projects**: The model is inverted.
  - **Fixed**: Time (sprints) and Cost (team capacity)
  - **Flexible**: Scope (features adjust based on priority)
- **Hybrid projects**: A mix. Program level might have fixed scope/date, while team level has flexible scope within sprints.

## 1.4b.3 The Iron Triangle vs. The Diamond

Sarah realizes that **scope, schedule, and cost are not the only success criteria.** Modern thinking adds:

- **Quality**: Does it work as required?
- **Value**: Does it deliver the intended benefits?
- **Risk**: Are we managing uncertainty effectively?

::: info
You cannot optimize for schedule and cost alone while ignoring quality or value.

## 1.4b.4 Scope Definition: The Foundation

Clear scope definition reduces surprises and conflict.

1. **Product scope**: Features and characteristics of the deliverable.
2. **Project scope**: Work done to create the product.
3. **Out of scope**: Explicit exclusions to prevent scope creep.

**Predictive**: Defined in detail upfront (WBS, requirements spec).
**Agile**: Emerges over time (Product Vision, prioritized Backlog).

## 1.4b.5 Schedule: Sequencing and Dependencies

1. **Identify activities**: What work needs to be done?
2. **Sequence activities**: What depends on what? (Finish-to-Start, etc.)
3. **Estimate duration**: How long will each step take?
4. **Build the schedule**: Critical Path Method (CPM) and Gantt charts.

**Predictive**: Detailed master schedule with clear milestones.
**Agile**: Timeboxed iterations (sprints) with velocity-based planning.

## 1.4b.6 Cost and Budget: Tracking and Controlling

**Predictive**:
- **Estimate costs** for each activity.
- **Develop a cost baseline** (S-curve).
- **Track actuals** and analyze variance (Earned Value).

**Agile**:
- **Burn rate**: Fixed cost per sprint (team capacity).
- **Budgeting**: "How many sprints can we afford?"

## 1.4b.7 Managing the Triangle: Trade-off Decisions

When you cannot have everything:
1. **Identify the true constraint**: What is non-negotiable?
2. **Explore options**: Extend schedule, reduce scope, or increase budget.
3. **Understand trade-offs**: What is the impact of each choice?
4. **Decide explicitly**: Make the choice with stakeholders.

## 1.4b.8 On the Exam: Scope, Schedule, Cost

**Red Flag Answers:**
- Promising everything without discussing trade-offs.
- Making scope changes silently.
- Cutting quality to hit a deadline.

**Good Answers:**
- Identifying fixed constraints.
- Communicating trade-offs clearly.
- Updating baselines after an agreed change.
