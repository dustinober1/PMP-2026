# 1.4 – Core Project Management Concepts

By the end of her first month, Sarah has learned how to choose a way of working (Section 1.3). But she realizes: *Choosing the right approach is only half the battle. I still need to manage stakeholders, constraints, and risks—regardless of whether I am working predictively, agilely, or hybrid.*

This section covers the core fundamentals that appear across the Exam Content Outline. Understanding these deeply will serve you well on the exam and in your career.

## Putting It All Together: Sarah's Integrated Approach

By the end of her first three months, Sarah has learned how these concepts—stakeholders, scope, schedule, cost, quality, risk, data, and ethics—fit together. They are not separate disciplines; they are interconnected.

::: details Sarah's Real-World Comparison
**Office Renovation (Predictive):**
- **Stakeholders**: CEO (date), CFO (budget), Employees (workspace). Constant communication.
- **Constraints**: Fixed scope spec and firm move date. Budget adjusted for changes.
- **Risk**: Schedule delays from permits or contractors. Mitigated by buffers and penalties.
- **Data**: Monthly tracking of SPI and CPI.

**Expense System (Agile):**
- **Stakeholders**: CFO (Product Owner) and Users (Testing). Feedback every 2 weeks.
- **Constraints**: Fixed team capacity and sprint duration. Scope is flexible.
- **Risk**: User adoption risk. Mitigated by early prototypes and user-centric design.
- **Data**: Team velocity and burn-down trends.

### Integrating Concepts on the Exam

On the PMP exam, questions often require you to integrate multiple concepts:

> *"A project is behind schedule and over budget. The sponsor is asking you to 'crash' the schedule (add resources). Your team is stressed, and users aren't happy with recent quality. What do you do?"*

**A high-performing Project Manager would:**

1.  **Diagnose**: Identify if the root cause is unrealistic planning or scope creep.
2.  **Engage**: Present trade-offs to the sponsor (e.g., reduce scope vs. increase cost).
3.  **Prioritize Quality**: Realize that rushing (crashing) often further degrades quality.
4.  **Protect the Team**: Acknowledge that a stressed team is a risk itself.
5.  **Act Ethically**: Don't promise more speed if you can't deliver it sustainably.
