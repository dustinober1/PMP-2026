# 1.4f – Professional Responsibility and Ethics

Project management is not just about mechanics; it is about doing the right thing for stakeholders, the team, and the organization.

## 1.4f.1 The Four PMI Values

The PMI Code of Ethics is built on four core values:

1. **Responsibility**: Owning your decisions and their consequences.
2. **Respect**: Valuing others, their time, and their diverse perspectives.
3. **Fairness**: Making impartial decisions based on facts and merit.
4. **Honesty**: Communicating truthfully, even when the news is bad.

## 1.4f.2 Ethical Challenges in Practice

### Conflicts of Interest
If you have a personal stake in a project decision (e.g., a friend bidding on a contract), you must:
- **Disclose** the relationship immediately.
- **Recuse** yourself from the decision-making process.

### Integrity in Reporting
If a project is failing, you have a professional obligation to report it honestly to sponsors. "Green status" reporting for a "Red" project is a breach of ethics.

### Respecting the Team
- Create **psychological safety**: Encourage diverse viewpoints.
- Prevent **burnout**: Don't enforce unsustainable work hours.
- Protect **confidentiality**: Handle personal or sensitive data with care.

## 1.4f.3 Speaking Up

When you see something wrong (e.g., a contractor cutting safety corners, a colleague accepting bribes):
- **Gather facts** first.
- **Report** it through appropriate channels (Sponsor, HR, Ethics Hotline).
- **Courage** is required to maintain professional standards.

## 1.4f.4 On the Exam: Ethics Scenarios

Ethics questions often present a situation where the "easy" or "profitable" path is unethical.

**Good Answers:**
- Choose honesty over convenience.
- Disclose conflicts of interest.
- Follow laws and regulations strictly.
- Treat every stakeholder with respect, regardless of power level.
