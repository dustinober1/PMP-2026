# 1.4e – Data-Informed Decision-Making

Project management increasingly uses data and metrics to support better decisions. Sarah learns to move beyond "gut feel" to evidence-based management.

## 1.4e.1 Data-Informed vs. Data-Driven

- **Data-Informed**: Use data as a key input, along with context, judgment, and experience.
- **Data-Driven**: Let data make the decision automatically, often ignoring human factors or context.

**Goal**: Be data-informed. Use metrics to surface problems, then use your judgment to solve them.

## 1.4e.2 Common Project Metrics

### Schedule Metrics
- **Schedule Variance (SV)**: Are we ahead or behind?
- **Schedule Performance Index (SPI)**: How efficient is our time usage? (>1.0 is good).
- **Burn-down/Burn-up Charts**: Visual tracking of work completion against a timeline.

### Cost Metrics
- **Cost Variance (CV)**: Are we over or under budget?
- **Cost Performance Index (CPI)**: How much value are we getting for every dollar spent? (>1.0 is good).
- **Burn Rate**: How fast is the budget being consumed?

### Quality Metrics
- **Defect Rate**: Bugs found per unit of work.
- **Test Coverage**: Percentage of requirements or code verified.
- **Cycle Time**: How long it takes for a task to go from start to finish.

## 1.4e.3 Leading vs. Lagging Indicators

- **Lagging Indicators**: Measure outcomes *after* the fact (e.g., final cost, items delivered). They tell you what happened but are too late to change.
- **Leading Indicators**: Predict the future (e.g., team morale, velocity trends, requirements churn). They help you act before a problem becomes a crisis.

## 1.4e.4 Metric Pitfalls

- **Vanity Metrics**: Things that look good but don't predict success (e.g., "lines of code").
- **Gaming the System**: Changing behavior to "hit the number" while hurting the project (e.g., closing bugs without fixing them).
- **Ignoring Context**: "Velocity is down" might just mean the team took a holiday, not that they are less productive.

## 1.4e.5 On the Exam: Data Scenarios

Exam questions ask you to interpret a metric and choose an action.

- **CPI < 1.0**: You are over budget. Action: Improve efficiency or reduce scope.
- **SPI < 1.0**: You are behind schedule. Action: Analyze the critical path or consider crashing/fast-tracking.
- **High Requirements Churn**: Scope is unstable. Action: Engage stakeholders to lock requirements or move to an agile approach.

::: tip Trend is Your Friend
A single data point can be an outlier. Always look for **trends** (3+ data points moving in a direction) before making major project adjustments.
