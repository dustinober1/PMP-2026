# 1.4d – Risk Management: Threats and Opportunities

Managing projects is fundamentally about managing uncertainty. Some uncertainty is a **threat** (things that could go wrong); some is an **opportunity** (things that could go better than expected).

## 1.4d.1 Identifying Risks

### Threats (Negative Risks)
- Resource shortages (team sickness, turnover)
- Technical failures (platform instability)
- Schedule delays (vendor issues)
- External shifts (regulatory changes)

### Opportunities (Positive Risks)
- Efficiency gains (new tool speeds up work)
- Technical breakthroughs
- Cost reductions (volume pricing)
- Early delivery potential

## 1.4d.2 Risk Analysis: Probability vs. Impact

Sarah learns to analyze risk using two dimensions:
1. **Probability**: How likely is this to occur? (Low/Medium/High)
2. **Impact**: How bad (or good) is the consequence? (Low/Medium/High)

**Risk Score = Probability × Impact**
High-score risks are prioritized for proactive mitigation.

## 1.4d.3 Risk Response Strategies

### For Threats
- **Avoid**: Change the plan to eliminate the risk (e.g., use a different technology).
- **Mitigate**: Reduce probability or impact (e.g., extra testing, backup servers).
- **Transfer**: Move the risk to a third party (e.g., insurance, fixed-price contracts).
- **Accept**: Acknowledge the risk and have a contingency plan if it happens.

### For Opportunities
- **Exploit**: Ensure the opportunity happens (e.g., prioritize a high-value partnership).
- **Enhance**: Increase probability or impact (e.g., assign your best team to a breakthrough area).
- **Share**: Partner with others to capture the benefit.
- **Accept**: Take the benefit if it comes, but don't actively pursue it.

## 1.4d.4 The Risk Register

Sarah maintains a **Risk Register**, a living document tracking:
- **Risk Description**: What exactly might happen?
- **Analysis**: Current probability and impact score.
- **Response Plan**: What are we doing about it?
- **Owner**: Who is responsible for monitoring this risk?
- **Status**: Is the risk active, mitigated, or closed?

## 1.4d.5 Risk and Ways of Working

- **Predictive**: Extensive upfront identification and formal contingency planning.
- **Agile**: Continuous risk identification in every sprint. Mitigation through "spikes" (research tasks) and frequent feedback.
- **Hybrid**: Program-level risks managed predictively; team-level risks managed agilely.

## 1.4d.6 On the Exam: Risk Scenarios

**Good Answers:**
- Identify and assess the risk before acting.
- Choose a strategy that fits the risk's score.
- Assign clear owners.
- Monitor trends (are risks increasing or decreasing?).

**Red Flags:**
- Ignoring a risk and hoping for the best.
- Reacting only after a risk occurs (no plan).
- Treating all risks with the same level of urgency.

::: info Key Concept
Risk management is not about *eliminating* risk (which is impossible); it's about being prepared so uncertainty doesn't derail your project.
