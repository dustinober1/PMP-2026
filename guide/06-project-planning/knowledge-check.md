# Knowledge Check: Project Planning

Test your understanding of scope, schedule, cost, and resource planning.

## Practice Questions

### Question 1: WBS Purpose

What is the PRIMARY purpose of the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)?

- A) To show activity dependencies
- B) To decompose scope into manageable components ✓
- C) To assign resources to activities
- D) To calculate the critical path

**Explanation**: The WBS is a hierarchical decomposition of project scope into work packages. Dependencies are shown in network diagrams, not the WBS.

---

### Question 2: Critical Path

In a project network, the critical path is:

- A) The path with the most activities
- B) The shortest path through the network
- C) The longest path through the network ✓
- D) The path with the most resources

**Explanation**: The critical path is the longest path, determining the minimum project duration. Activities on this path have zero float.

---

### Question 3: Float Calculation

Activity A has ES=5, EF=10, LS=8, LF=13. What is the total float?

- A) 2 days
- B) 3 days ✓
- C) 5 days
- D) 8 days

**Explanation**: Total Float = LS - ES = 8 - 5 = 3 days (or LF - EF = 13 - 10 = 3 days).

---

### Question 4: Schedule Compression

You need to shorten your project schedule but cannot increase cost. Which technique should you try first?

- A) Crashing
- B) Fast-tracking ✓
- C) Adding resources
- D) Extending work hours

**Explanation**: Fast-tracking overlaps activities without adding cost (but increases risk). Crashing adds resources which increases cost.

---

### Question 5: Three-Point Estimate

Using PERT, calculate the expected duration: Optimistic=4, Most Likely=6, Pessimistic=14

- A) 6 days
- B) 7 days ✓
- C) 8 days
- D) 9 days

**Explanation**: PERT = (O + 4M + P) / 6 = (4 + 24 + 14) / 6 = 42/6 = 7 days

---

### Question 6: Estimation Accuracy

Which estimation technique typically provides the MOST accurate cost estimate?

- A) Analogous
- B) Parametric
- C) Bottom-up ✓
- D) Rough order of magnitude

**Explanation**: Bottom-up estimation provides the most accuracy (-5% to +10%) because it estimates each work package individually.

---

### Question 7: Contract Risk

In which contract type does the BUYER assume the most cost risk?

- A) Firm Fixed Price (FFP)
- B) Fixed Price Incentive Fee (FPIF)
- C) Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) ✓
- D) Time and Materials (T&M)

**Explanation**: In cost-reimbursable contracts (like CPFF), the buyer pays all costs plus a fee, bearing the risk of cost overruns.

---

### Question 8: Resource Leveling

What is the potential impact of resource leveling?

- A) Increased cost
- B) Extended schedule ✓
- C) Reduced scope
- D) Improved quality

**Explanation**: Resource leveling resolves over-allocation by adjusting the schedule, which may extend the project duration.

---

### Question 9: WBS 100% Rule

What does the 100% Rule mean for a WBS?

- A) 100% of the team must approve the WBS
- B) The WBS must be 100% complete before planning
- C) The WBS must include 100% of project scope ✓
- D) Each work package must take 100 hours maximum

**Explanation**: The 100% Rule states that the WBS must include all project scope—if it's not in the WBS, it's not in scope.

---

### Question 10: Finish-to-Start Dependency

In a Finish-to-Start (FS) relationship between Activity A and Activity B:

- A) B must finish before A starts
- B) A must finish before B can start ✓
- C) A and B must finish together
- D) A and B must start together

**Explanation**: FS means the predecessor (A) must finish before the successor (B) can start. This is the most common dependency type.

## Exam Tips for Planning Questions

::: tip Calculation Practice
Planning questions often require calculations:
1. **Three-point estimates**: Know both formulas
2. **Float**: LS - ES or LF - EF
3. **Standard deviation**: (P - O) / 6
4. **Critical path**: Identify longest path, zero float
:::

### Common Wrong Answer Patterns

- ❌ Confusing WBS with network diagram
- ❌ Crashing non-critical path activities
- ❌ Using management reserve without approval
- ❌ Assuming analogous is more accurate than bottom-up
- ❌ Thinking fixed price means no risk to buyer

### Right Answer Patterns

- ✅ WBS decomposes scope; network shows dependencies
- ✅ Critical path has zero float
- ✅ Fast-tracking increases risk; crashing increases cost
- ✅ Bottom-up is most accurate estimation
- ✅ Fixed price puts risk on seller
