# Chapter 6: Project Planning

Planning is not a one-time event; it is a **continuous process of refinement**. In the 2026 PMP exam, planning spans the spectrum from detailed predictive baselines to iterative agile backlogs.

## Why Planning Matters for the PMP Exam

The planning domain represents approximately **25% of the PMP exam** content. More importantly, planning questions often integrate multiple knowledge areas simultaneously:
- A scope question might require schedule analysis
- A cost question might involve resource constraints
- A procurement question might trigger risk considerations

The exam tests your ability to **think systemically** about planning—recognizing that every planning decision creates ripples across the entire project.

## The Planning Core

Strategic planning is about creating an integrated **Project Management Plan** that balances the competing needs of scope, schedule, cost, quality, and resources.

### The Project Management Plan (Integration)
The **Project Management Plan** is the master document that describes how the project will be executed, monitored, and controlled. It includes:

**Component Plans (How you'll manage each knowledge area):**
- Scope Management Plan
- Schedule Management Plan
- Cost Management Plan
- Quality Management Plan
- Resource Management Plan
- Communications Management Plan
- Risk Management Plan
- Procurement Management Plan
- Stakeholder Engagement Plan

**Baselines (Performance measurement targets):**
- Scope Baseline (Scope Statement + WBS + WBS Dictionary)
- Schedule Baseline (Approved schedule model)
- Cost Baseline (Time-phased budget for EVM)

**Supporting Documents:**
- Requirements documentation, RTM, activity lists, resource calendars, cost estimates, assumptions log, and more

::: tip 💡 Exam Reality Check
When a question mentions "the project management plan," it's referring to this integrated document—not just a Gantt chart. Changes to baselines require formal change control. Changes to subsidiary plans may only require PM approval (check the Change Management Plan).

## What Planning Produces (PMP Reality)
On the exam and in practice, planning creates a **system of documents** that all support each other:

- **Baselines (approved targets)**: Scope Baseline, Schedule Baseline, Cost Baseline
- **Subsidiary plans (how you'll manage)**: Scope/Schedule/Cost/Resource/Procurement Management Plans
- **Supporting documents (details & evidence)**: RTM, activity list, network logic, resource calendars, cost estimates, assumptions log

::: tip 💡 Baseline vs. Draft
If a question says a plan is **approved** or **baselined**, changes require formal **change control**. If it says **draft**, you're still refining.

## Planning Process Groups: The Flow

Planning in PMBOK follows a logical sequence (though in reality, iteration is constant):

1. **Plan Scope Management** → Define how scope will be managed
2. **Collect Requirements** → Gather stakeholder needs
3. **Define Scope** → Create the scope statement
4. **Create WBS** → Decompose work into manageable pieces
5. **Plan Schedule Management** → Define how schedule will be managed
6. **Define Activities** → Break down work packages
7. **Sequence Activities** → Establish dependencies
8. **Estimate Durations** → Determine time needed
9. **Develop Schedule** → Create the schedule model
10. **Plan Cost Management** → Define how costs will be managed
11. **Estimate Costs** → Determine activity costs
12. **Determine Budget** → Aggregate costs into baseline
13. **Plan Resource Management** → Define how resources will be managed
14. **Estimate Activity Resources** → Determine resource needs
15. **Plan Procurement Management** → Define make-or-buy decisions

::: info 🔁 Iterative Reality
While the PMBOK presents these sequentially, real projects iterate constantly. You might estimate costs, realize you can't afford the scope, then go back and refine requirements. This is **progressive elaboration**, not poor planning.

## 2026 Mindset: The Integrated Plan

A project falls apart when plans exist in silos. Integration means:
- **Scope** changes trigger **Schedule** updates
- **Cost** limits force **Scope** prioritization
- **Resource** availability dictates **Schedule** feasibility
- **Risk** responses may require **Budget** adjustments
- **Quality** requirements drive **Resource** needs

### The Triple Constraint Is Now a Hexagon

Traditional PM taught the "triple constraint" (scope, time, cost). Modern PM recognizes six competing constraints:

```
        Quality
       /      \
   Scope — ✱ — Resources
      \       /
       Time—Cost—Risk
```

Every planning decision affects multiple constraints. The PM's job is to **optimize for value**, not just balance a triangle.

## Planning Approaches: Predictive vs. Adaptive

| Aspect | Predictive (Waterfall) | Adaptive (Agile) |
|:-------|:----------------------|:----------------|
| **When to use** | Stable requirements, regulatory compliance | High uncertainty, rapid change |
| **Scope detail** | Detailed upfront (WBS) | High-level roadmap + iterative refinement |
| **Schedule** | Gantt chart with milestones | Fixed sprints, flexible scope |
| **Cost** | Detailed budget with reserves | Budget by iteration or release |
| **Changes** | Formal change control | Continuous backlog refinement |
| **Success measure** | On-time, on-budget, to-spec | Value delivered, customer satisfaction |

::: tip 💡 Hybrid Reality
Most 2026 projects use **Hybrid approaches**. You might use predictive planning for compliance-heavy infrastructure work while using agile sprints for the software layer. The exam will test your ability to choose the right approach for the context.

## Progressive Elaboration: Planning Over Time

You don't need perfect information on Day 1. Planning evolves as you learn:

**Project Initiation (High-Level):**
- Business case and benefits
- High-level scope and objectives
- Rough order of magnitude (ROM) estimates (−25% to +75%)

**Early Planning (Medium Detail):**
- Detailed requirements for Phase 1
- Near-term activities decomposed
- Budget estimates (−10% to +25%)

**Detailed Planning (Precision):**
- Work packages fully defined
- Activity-level schedules
- Definitive estimates (−5% to +10%)

This is called **Rolling Wave Planning**: near-term work is detailed, future work remains at a higher level until you know more.

::: tip 💡 Study Recommendation
On the exam, focus on **Progressive Elaboration**. You don't know everything on Day 1. Planning should grow more detailed as you learn more about the project environment. This is not "poor planning"—it's smart risk management in uncertain environments.
