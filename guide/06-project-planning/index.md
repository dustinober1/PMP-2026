# Chapter 6: Project Planning

Planning is not a one-time event; it is a **continuous process of refinement**. In the 2026 PMP exam, planning spans the spectrum from detailed predictive baselines to iterative agile backlogs.

## Why Planning Matters for the PMP Exam

The planning domain represents approximately **25% of the PMP exam** content. More importantly, planning questions often integrate multiple knowledge areas simultaneously:
- A scope question might require schedule analysis
- A cost question might involve resource constraints
- A procurement question might trigger risk considerations

The exam tests your ability to **think systemically** about planning—recognizing that every planning decision creates ripples across the entire project.

### 2026 Exam Emphasis Areas
The 2026 PMP exam places special emphasis on:
1. **Adaptive Planning**: Understanding when to use predictive vs. agile vs. hybrid approaches
2. **Value-Driven Delivery**: Optimizing for outcomes, not just outputs
3. **Integrated Change Management**: How scope/schedule/cost/quality changes interrelate
4. **Stakeholder-Centric Planning**: Building plans that account for stakeholder expectations
5. **Sustainability (ESG)**: Environmental and social considerations in planning decisions

## The Planning Core

Strategic planning is about creating an integrated **Project Management Plan** that balances the competing needs of scope, schedule, cost, quality, and resources.

### The Project Management Plan (Integration)
The **Project Management Plan** is the master document that describes how the project will be executed, monitored, and controlled. It includes:

**Component Plans (How you'll manage each knowledge area):**
- Scope Management Plan
- Schedule Management Plan
- Cost Management Plan
- Quality Management Plan
- Resource Management Plan
- Communications Management Plan
- Risk Management Plan
- Procurement Management Plan
- Stakeholder Engagement Plan

**Baselines (Performance measurement targets):**
- Scope Baseline (Scope Statement + WBS + WBS Dictionary)
- Schedule Baseline (Approved schedule model)
- Cost Baseline (Time-phased budget for EVM)

<strong>Supporting Documents:</strong>
- Requirements documentation, RTM, activity lists, resource calendars, cost estimates, assumptions log, and more

::: tip  Exam Reality Check
When a question mentions "the project management plan," it's referring to this integrated document—not just a Gantt chart. Changes to baselines require formal change control. Changes to subsidiary plans may only require PM approval (check the Change Management Plan).

### Component Plan Overview

Each subsidiary management plan answers specific questions:

| Plan | Key Questions Answered |
|:-----|:-----------------------|
| **Scope Management Plan** | How will scope be defined, validated, and controlled? |
| **Schedule Management Plan** | How will the schedule be developed, monitored, and controlled? |
| **Cost Management Plan** | How will costs be estimated, budgeted, and controlled? |
| **Quality Management Plan** | What quality standards apply and how will they be assured? |
| **Resource Management Plan** | How will resources be acquired, managed, and released? |
| **Communications Management Plan** | Who needs what information, when, and in what format? |
| **Risk Management Plan** | How will risks be identified, analyzed, responded to, and monitored? |
| **Procurement Management Plan** | What will be procured, how, and from whom? |
| **Stakeholder Engagement Plan** | How will stakeholders be engaged throughout the project? |
