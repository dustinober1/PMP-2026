# Chapter 6: Project Planning

Welcome to Chapter 6 of the PMP Exam Prep 2026 study guide. This chapter covers the comprehensive planning activities that translate project initiation into actionable plans for execution.

::: info Process Domain
Project planning is a major part of the **Process domain (41% of the 2026 exam)**. Understanding how to plan scope, schedule, cost, and other knowledge areas is fundamental to PMP success.

## Why This Chapter Matters

Effective planning:

- **Establishes baselines** for scope, schedule, and cost
- **Reduces uncertainty** through risk identification and mitigation
- **Enables coordination** across team members and stakeholders
- **Provides measurement framework** for progress tracking
- **Supports decision-making** when changes occur

| **Critical Path**         | Longest path through network                  | Very High      |
| **Estimation Techniques** | Analogous, parametric, bottom-up, three-point | Very High      |
| **Schedule Compression**  | Crashing and fast-tracking                    | High           |
| **Cost Baseline**         | Time-phased budget                            | High           |

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

1. ✅ Develop a scope statement and WBS
2. ✅ Create a project schedule using CPM
3. ✅ Apply schedule compression techniques appropriately
4. ✅ Estimate costs using multiple techniques
5. ✅ Develop a cost baseline and budget
6. ✅ Plan for resources and procurement

::: tip Exam Strategy
Planning questions often present scenarios requiring calculation (critical path, estimates) or judgment (which technique to use). Practice both computational and scenario-based questions.
