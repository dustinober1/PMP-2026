**ECO Task**: Plan and manage communication

Communication is the **oil that keeps the project machine running**. The PM spends approximately 90% of their time communicating—yet poor communication remains the leading cause of project failure.

##  The Communications Planning Flow

### Step 1: Plan Communications Management
**Purpose**: Determine stakeholder information needs and define communication approach
**Key Outputs**:
- Communications Management Plan
- Communication methods and technologies
- Update frequency schedules

### Communication Planning Inputs

| Input | Use |
|:------|:----|
| **Stakeholder Register** | Who needs information |
| **Stakeholder Engagement Plan** | How to engage each |
| **Organizational Process Assets** | Templates, lessons learned |
| **Enterprise Environmental Factors** | Culture, technology, regulations |

---

##  Communications Management Plan

The Communications Management Plan documents:

| Component | Description | Example |
|:----------|:------------|:--------|
| **Stakeholder Information Needs** | What each stakeholder needs | Sponsor: project status, issues, decisions |
| **Information to Communicate** | What content is shared | Status reports, risk updates, milestone reports |
| **Reason for Distribution** | Why this communication | Regulatory requirement, stakeholder request |
| **Timeframe/Frequency** | When/how often | Weekly, daily, on-change |
| **Responsible Party** | Who creates/sends | PM, Team Lead, PMO |
| **Recipients** | Who receives | Sponsor, Steering Committee, Team |
| **Methods/Technologies** | How delivered | Email, meeting, dashboard |
| **Escalation Procedures** | How issues are escalated | Time-based, severity-based |
| **Glossary** | Common terms defined | Avoiding misunderstanding |

---

##  Communication Methods

### By Communication Type

| Type | Description | Examples | Best For |
|:-----|:------------|:---------|:---------|
| **Interactive** | Real-time, two-way | Meetings, calls, video, face-to-face | Complex topics, relationship building, problem-solving |
| **Push** | One-way distribution | Email, reports, letters, memos | Updates, FYI, documentation |
| **Pull** | Recipient-initiated | Intranet, wiki, shared drives | Reference, large audience, self-service |

### By Formality

| Level | Examples | When to Use |
|:------|:---------|:------------|
| **Formal Written** | Contracts, reports, legal documents | Audit trail, legal, complex |
| **Formal Verbal** | Presentations, speeches | Large audiences, important announcements |
| **Informal Written** | Email, chat, notes | Day-to-day coordination |
| **Informal Verbal** | Hallway conversations, calls | Quick coordination, relationship building |

### Communication Channel Calculation

<ConceptGrid>
  <ConceptCard title="The Formula" variant="primary">
    <strong>Channels = n(n - 1) / 2</strong><br/><br/>
    Where <strong>n</strong> is the number of stakeholders. Complexity grows exponentially as team size increases.
  </ConceptCard>
  <ConceptCard title="Complexity Map" variant="secondary">
    <ul>
      <li><strong>5 People:</strong> 10 Channels</li>
      <li><strong>10 People:</strong> 45 Channels</li>
      <li><strong>15 People:</strong> 105 Channels</li>
      <li><strong>20 People:</strong> 190 Channels</li>
    </ul>
  </ConceptCard>
</ConceptGrid>

::: warning  Exam Trap
When a question says "a new team member is added," calculate the NEW total number of channels. If n goes from 5 to 6: <code>6(5)/2 = 15</code> (an increase of 5 channels).

##  Communication Models

##  Communication in Virtual/Distributed Teams

### Virtual Team Challenges

<ConceptGrid>
  <ConceptCard title="Logistics" variant="primary">
    <strong>Time zones:</strong> Use rotating meeting times and asynchronous tools.<br/>
    <strong>Technology:</strong> Ensure baseline infrastructure and backup plans.
  </ConceptCard>
  <ConceptCard title="Human Connection" variant="secondary">
    <strong>Isolation:</strong> Implement virtual team building and coffee chats.<br/>
    <strong>Visual Cues:</strong> Use video when possible to capture body language.
  </ConceptCard>
</ConceptGrid>

### Virtual Communication Best Practices

1. **Default to video** for meetings when possible
2. **Use asynchronous tools** for information sharing (not just meetings)
3. **Document decisions** in writing (not just verbal)
4. **Establish communication norms** (response time expectations, core overlap hours)
5. **Schedule regular touchpoints** (daily standups, weekly syncs)
6. **Create informal interaction opportunities** (virtual coffee breaks)

##  Effective Communication Techniques

### Active Listening

| Technique | Description |
|:----------|:------------|
| **Pay full attention** | Remove distractions, make eye contact |
| **Paraphrase** | "So what you're saying is..." |
| **Ask clarifying questions** | "Can you elaborate on...?" |
| **Summarize** | "Let me make sure I understand..." |

| **Avoid interrupting** | Let the speaker complete thoughts |

### Giving Effective Feedback

<ConceptCard title="The SBI Model" variant="success">
  <ul>
    <li><strong>S - Situation:</strong> Describe the specific time and place.</li>
    <li><strong>B - Behavior:</strong> Describe the specific observable action.</li>
    <li><strong>I - Impact:</strong> Describe the result or feeling caused.</li>
  </ul>
  <hr style="margin: 10px 0; border: none; border-top: 1px solid var(--vp-c-divider);" />
  <em>Example: "In yesterday's meeting (S), when you interrupted the lead (B), it discouraged others from sharing (I)."</em>
</ConceptCard>

### Running Effective Meetings

<strong>Before:</strong>
- Define purpose and desired outcomes
- Create and distribute agenda
- Invite only necessary participants
- Prepare materials in advance

<strong>During:</strong>
- Start and end on time
- Follow the agenda
- Assign a facilitator and note-taker
- Park off-topic items
- Capture action items with owners and due dates

<strong>After:</strong>
- Distribute meeting notes within 24 hours
- Follow up on action items
- Evaluate meeting effectiveness

##  Communication Planning Scenarios (Exam Practice)

### Scenario 1: New Team Member
**Situation**: A 10-person project adds one new team member. How many communication channels now exist?
**Answer**: n(n-1)/2 = 11(10)/2 = **55 channels**

### Scenario 2: Misunderstanding
**Situation**: A stakeholder claims they never received important project information.
**Answer**: Review the **Communications Management Plan** to verify what was supposed to be communicated, to whom, and how. Check if the agreed method was followed.

### Scenario 3: Cultural Barrier
**Situation**: A team member from a high-context culture isn't speaking up in meetings.
**Answer**: Use **interactive communication** in a smaller setting; actively invite input; use written channels for those who prefer time to compose thoughts.

### Scenario 4: Stakeholder Overload
**Situation**: The sponsor complains about receiving too many emails.
**Answer**: Review and consolidate communications. Use a **weekly summary** instead of daily updates. Match communication frequency to stakeholder preferences.

### Scenario 5: Remote Team Issues
**Situation**: Distributed team productivity is declining due to communication breakdowns.
**Answer**: Establish **communication norms** (core hours, response expectations), increase use of **video**, implement **regular synchronous touchpoints**.

### Scenario 6: Sensitive Message
**Situation**: The PM needs to communicate a difficult project decision.
**Answer**: Use **formal, interactive communication** (meeting, video call) for sensitive topics. Follow up with written summary. Allow time for questions.

::: tip  Exam Insight
If the team size increases from 5 to 10, the number of channels increases from 10 to 45. This explains why **communication complexity** grows exponentially, not linearly. Always choose the most **interactive** method for resolving conflict or clarifying complex requirements.

::: tip  Exam Insight
Know the communication channel formula: <strong>n(n-1)/2</strong>. For communication type selection: <strong>Interactive</strong> is best for complex/sensitive topics, <strong>Push</strong> for updates, <strong>Pull</strong> for reference material.
