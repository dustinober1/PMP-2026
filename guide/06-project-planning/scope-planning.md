# 6.1 Scope Planning

Scope is the boundary of your project. It defines exactly what will be delivered, and just as importantly, what will **not** be delivered. In the 2026 PMP exam, scope is the foundation of the "Value Delivery" mindset.

---

## 🔍 Requirements vs. Scope
- **Product Scope**: The features and functions that characterize a product, service, or result. (The "What").
- **Project Scope**: The work performed to deliver a product, service, or result with the specified features and functions. (The "How").

::: tip 💡 Pro Tip: Scope Creep
Uncontrolled expansion of product or project scope without adjustments to time, cost, and resources is **Scope Creep**. The best defense is a strong **Scope Baseline**.

## 🛠️ The Scope Baseline
The Scope Baseline consists of three critical documents. If any of these change, you must follow formal Change Control.
1. **Project Scope Statement**: The detailed description of the scope, major deliverables, assumptions, and constraints.
2. **WBS (Work Breakdown Structure)**: A hierarchical decomposition of the total scope of work to be carried out by the project team.
3. **WBS Dictionary**: Detailed information about each node in the WBS (e.g., description, owner, acceptance criteria).

---

## 🧱 Developing the WBS
Decomposition is the technique used to divide project deliverables into smaller, more manageable parts called **Work Packages**.
- **The 100% Rule**: The WBS represents 100% of the work defined by the project scope and captures all deliverables—internal, external, and interim.
- **Work Package**: The lowest level of the WBS. It should be small enough to be estimated for cost and duration (typically 8 to 80 hours of work).

## 🔄 Scope in Agile (Adaptive)
In Agile, scope isn't fixed at the start. Instead, it is managed through a **Product Backlog**.
- **Product Backlog**: A prioritized list of everything that is known to be needed in the product.
- **User Stories**: A small, user-valued increment of work. *Format: As a [user], I want [goal] so that [benefit].*
- **Backlog Grooming (Refinement)**: The continuous process of adding detail, estimates, and order to items in the backlog.

  <strong>📝 Exam Insight:</strong> If an exam scenario says a stakeholder wants to add a "small feature" that isn't in the plan, the Project Manager must **Evaluate the impact** and then follow the **Change Management Process**. Never just say "Yes" to keep a stakeholder happy!
