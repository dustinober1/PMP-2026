# 6.4 Resource & Procurement

A project plan is just a dream until you have the people and materials to execute it. This section covers how to secure and optimize your resources.

## 👥 Resource Management
Resources are more than just "headcount." They include people, equipment, materials, and facilities.
- **Resource Leveling**: Adjusting the schedule (often extending it) to ensure no resource is over-allocated.
- **Resource Smoothing**: Adjusting the schedule within the available **Float** so the finish date is not delayed.

::: tip 💡 Pro Tip: The Resource Histogram
A **Resource Histogram** is a bar chart showing the amount of time a resource is scheduled to work over a series of time periods. It is your best tool for spotting over-allocation before it happens.

## 🏗️ Procurement Strategy
Sometimes you can't do it all yourself. **Make-or-Buy Analysis** is the process of deciding whether a particular work package can be produced by the project team or should be purchased from outside sources.

## 🤝 Contract Types
The type of contract determines who carries the financial **Risk**.

| Contract Type                | Description                            | Who Carries Risk? |
| :--------------------------- | :------------------------------------- | :---------------- |
| **Fixed Price (FFP)**        | Seller completes work for a set price. | **Seller**        |
| **Cost Reimbursable (CPFF)** | Buyer pays actual costs + a fee.       | **Buyer**         |
| **Time & Materials (T&M)**   | Paid by the hour/unit.                 | **Shared**        |

::: info 🛠️ 2026 Focus: Agile Contracts
Agile contracts often use a **"Money for Nothing, Change for Free"** model or tiered fixed-price models to allow for scope flexibility while protecting the vendor's costs.

## 🧭 Source Selection
How do you pick the right vendor?
- **Weighting System**: Giving scores to different criteria (Price, Experience, Technical Approach).
- **Independent Estimates**: The PMO creates its own estimate to ensure the vendor bids are realistic ("Sanity Check").

  <strong>📝 Exam Insight:</strong> If a project's scope is unclear or likely to change significantly, **NEVER** use a Fixed Price contract. Use a <strong>Cost-Reimbursable</strong> or <strong>Time & Materials</strong> contract instead.
