# 6.4 – Resource and Procurement Planning

## 6.4.1 Introduction

Projects require resources—people, equipment, materials, and sometimes external vendors. This section covers planning for acquiring and managing these resources.

::: tip Key Insight

## 6.4.2 Resource Planning

### Types of Resources

| Type            | Examples                               |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Human**       | Team members, contractors, consultants |
| **Physical**    | Equipment, materials, facilities       |
| **Financial**   | Budget, funding                        |
| **Information** | Data, documents, expertise             |

### Resource Requirements

For each activity, identify:
- **Type** of resource needed
- **Quantity** required
- **Skills/specifications**
- **When** needed (timing)
- **Duration** of need

---

## 6.4.3 Resource Estimation

### Approaches

| Approach                 | Description                           |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| **Expert judgment**      | Ask those who know the work           |
| **Alternative analysis** | Compare different resource options    |
| **Published data**       | Industry standards, benchmarks        |
| **Bottom-up**            | Estimate for each activity, aggregate |

### Considerations

- Skill level affects duration
- Availability affects scheduling
- Location affects cost
- Experience affects quality

---

## 6.4.4 Resource Allocation

### Resource Calendar

Shows when resources are available:

| Element           | Description                |
| ----------------- | -------------------------- |
| Working days      | Days resource is available |
| Working hours     | Hours per day              |
| Holidays          | Non-working days           |
| Vacation          | Planned absences           |
| Other commitments | Time on other projects     |

### Resource Histogram

Bar chart showing:
- Resource usage over time
- Periods of over/under-allocation
- Visual identification of conflicts

---

## 6.4.5 Resource Optimization

### Resource Leveling

Adjusts the schedule to address resource constraints:

- May extend schedule to avoid overallocation
- Prioritizes critical path activities
- Smooths resource demand

**Trade-off**: Schedule may get longer

### Resource Smoothing

Adjusts activities within their float:

- Does not extend schedule
- Uses available slack
- May not resolve all conflicts

**Trade-off**: Limited improvement possible

---

## 6.4.6 Team Acquisition

### Pre-Assignment

Some team members assigned before planning:
- Named in charter or proposal
- Required for specialized expertise
- Committed by functional managers

### Negotiation

Working with functional managers:
- Clarify skills and timing needed
- Understand competing priorities
- Document agreements
- Handle conflicts constructively

### Acquisition Challenges

| Challenge              | Response                               |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Key skills unavailable | Training, outsourcing, adjust schedule |
| Part-time allocation   | Account for context switching          |
| Virtual team           | Address communication, collaboration   |
| Competing projects     | Prioritize with leadership             |

## 6.4.7 Procurement Planning

### Make-or-Buy Analysis

Decide whether to:
- **Make**: Do work internally
- **Buy**: Hire external resources

### Factors in Make-or-Buy

| Factor          | Make (Internal)     | Buy (External)         |
| --------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Core competency | Build capability    | Non-core, outsource    |
| Cost            | Cheaper internally  | Cheaper externally     |
| Capacity        | Resources available | Constrained internally |
| Control         | Need tight control  | Can accept external    |
| Speed           | Can meet timeline   | Faster externally      |
| Risk            | Manageable          | Transfer to vendor     |

## 6.4.8 Contract Types

### Fixed Price Contracts

| ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------- |

| **Fixed Price Economic Price Adjustment (FPEPA)** | Adjusts for economic changes | Shared risk       |

**Best for**: Well-defined scope, stable requirements

### Cost-Reimbursable Contracts

### Time and Materials (T&M)

- Pay for hours worked + materials
- Moderate risk sharing
- Best for: Unknown duration, staff augmentation

1. **Plan resources systematically**: Type, quantity, skills, timing
2. **Optimize allocation**: Leveling may extend schedule; smoothing uses float
3. **Acquire through negotiation**: Work with functional managers
4. **Make-or-buy analysis**: Consider core competency, cost, control, risk
5. **Know contract types**: Fixed price (seller risk) vs. cost-plus (buyer risk)
6. **Select vendors carefully**: Price is not the only criterion
