# Chapter 9: Monitoring & Closing

If planning is the "Blueprint" and Execution is the "Work," then Monitoring & Closing is the **"Guardrail."** In the 2026 PMP exam, your role is to ensure the project stays on track and ends with a clean, value-focused handoff.

::: tip What the Exam Tests
Most questions in this chapter are about **control discipline**: interpreting metrics, detecting variance early, using the correct log (risk vs issue vs change), and following formal acceptance/closure instead of “just moving on.”

::: info The Two Jobs of Chapter 9
- **Monitoring & Controlling**: measure performance, manage variance, and govern change.
- **Closing**: transfer ownership, close contracts, archive records, and preserve lessons learned as organizational assets.

## The Process of Control
Monitoring isn't just about watching; it's about **Proactive Adjustment**. It’s the constant refinement of the project's path to ensure you arrive at the intended strategic destination.

## 2026 Focus: Integrated Governance
Success in Monitoring & Closing is measured by:
- **Financial Integrity**: Using **Earned Value Management (EVM)** to prove progress to stakeholders.
- **Change Agility**: Balancing the need for a stable baseline with the need to pivot when requirements change.
- **Operational Readiness**: Ensuring the organization can support what you built (training, runbooks, support model).
- **Value Harvest**: Ensuring the organization actually receives the benefits promised in the Business Case (ownership transfer + benefits tracking).
