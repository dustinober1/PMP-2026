# Chapter 9: Monitoring, Control, and Closing

Welcome to Chapter 9 of the PMP Exam Prep 2026 study guide. This chapter covers tracking project performance, managing variances, implementing changes, and properly closing projects.

::: info Process Domain
Monitoring and controlling activities are core parts of the **Process domain (41% of exam)**. Understanding earned value, variance analysis, and change control is essential for PMP success.
:::

## Why This Chapter Matters

Projects rarely go exactly according to plan:

- **Monitoring** provides visibility into actual performance
- **Controlling** keeps projects on track when variances occur
- **Change control** manages scope, schedule, and cost changes
- **Closing** ensures proper handoff and lessons learned

- Performance metrics and tracking
- Earned Value Management (EVM)
- Schedule and cost control
- Change control and configuration management
- Stakeholder engagement during execution

### [9.2 – Project Closure](./project-closure)
Properly ending projects and capturing lessons.
- Administrative and contractual closure
- Lessons learned
- Benefits transition
- Team recognition

## Key Concepts to Master

| Concept                       | Description                        | Exam Relevance |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------- |
| **Earned Value (EV, PV, AC)** | Integrated performance measurement | Very High      |
| **CPI and SPI**               | Cost and schedule efficiency       | Very High      |
| **Variance Analysis**         | SV, CV, VAC                        | Very High      |
| **Change Control**            | Formal process for changes         | High           |
| **Lessons Learned**           | Capturing project knowledge        | High           |

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

1. ✅ Calculate and interpret EVM metrics (PV, EV, AC, CPI, SPI)
2. ✅ Forecast project completion using EAC formulas
3. ✅ Apply appropriate control actions for variances
4. ✅ Implement change control processes
5. ✅ Conduct proper project closure activities
6. ✅ Facilitate effective lessons learned

::: tip Exam Strategy
EVM calculations appear frequently on the exam. Know the formulas and what each index means:
- SPI > 1 = ahead of schedule
- CPI > 1 = under budget
