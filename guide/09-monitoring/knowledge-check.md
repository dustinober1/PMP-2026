# Knowledge Check: Monitoring, Control, and Closing

Test your understanding of EVM, variance analysis, change control, and project closure.

## Practice Questions

### Question 1: EVM - Schedule Variance

A project has PV = $100,000, EV = $90,000, and AC = $95,000. What is the Schedule Variance (SV)?

- A) $5,000
- B) -$5,000
- C) -$10,000 ✓
- D) $10,000

**Explanation**: SV = EV - PV = $90,000 - $100,000 = -$10,000. Negative SV means behind schedule.

---

### Question 2: EVM - Cost Performance Index

Using the same data (PV = $100,000, EV = $90,000, AC = $95,000), what is the CPI?

- A) 0.90
- B) 0.95 ✓
- C) 1.05
- D) 1.10

**Explanation**: CPI = EV / AC = $90,000 / $95,000 = 0.947 ≈ 0.95. CPI < 1 means over budget.

---

### Question 3: SPI Interpretation

A project has SPI = 1.15. This means the project is:

- A) 15% over budget
- B) 15% under budget
- C) 15% ahead of schedule ✓
- D) 15% behind schedule

**Explanation**: SPI > 1 means ahead of schedule. An SPI of 1.15 means getting 115% of planned work done.

---

### Question 4: Estimate at Completion

A project has BAC = $500,000, EV = $200,000, AC = $250,000, and CPI = 0.80. If current CPI continues, what is the EAC?

- A) $400,000
- B) $500,000
- C) $550,000
- D) $625,000 ✓

**Explanation**: EAC = BAC / CPI = $500,000 / 0.80 = $625,000

---

### Question 5: Change Control

A stakeholder requests a change to add new features. What should the PM do FIRST?

- A) Reject the change to protect scope
- B) Implement the change to satisfy the stakeholder
- C) Evaluate the impact of the change ✓
- D) Schedule a CCB meeting immediately

**Explanation**: Before approval or rejection, assess the change's impact on scope, schedule, cost, and quality. Then the change can be properly reviewed.

---

### Question 6: Variance Threshold

A project has a CPI of 0.92 and SPI of 0.88. The project is:

- A) Under budget and ahead of schedule
- B) Over budget and behind schedule ✓
- C) Under budget and behind schedule
- D) Over budget and ahead of schedule

**Explanation**: CPI < 1 means over budget. SPI < 1 means behind schedule. Both indices below 1 indicate trouble.

---

### Question 7: Lessons Learned

When should lessons learned be captured?

- A) Only at project closure
- B) At each phase gate
- C) Throughout the project lifecycle ✓
- D) When problems occur

**Explanation**: Best practice is to capture lessons throughout—not just at the end when details are forgotten.

---

### Question 8: Administrative Closure

Which of the following is NOT a typical administrative closure activity?

- A) Obtaining formal acceptance of deliverables
- B) Archiving project documents
- C) Developing the project charter ✓
- D) Releasing team members

**Explanation**: The project charter is developed during initiation, not closure.

---

### Question 9: TCPI Interpretation

A project's TCPI (based on BAC) is 1.25. This indicates:

- A) The project is performing well
- B) Remaining work must be 25% more efficient than planned ✓
- C) The project will be under budget
- D) Current performance is excellent

**Explanation**: TCPI > 1 means you need better-than-planned performance on remaining work to meet budget. At 1.25, you need 25% better efficiency—a serious challenge.

---

### Question 10: Benefits Transition

Who is typically responsible for tracking benefits AFTER project closure?

- A) Project manager
- B) Business owner/sponsor ✓
- C) PMO
- D) Project team

**Explanation**: Benefits are realized in operations after project closure. The business owner/sponsor typically owns ongoing benefit tracking.

## EVM Formula Quick Reference

| Formula  | Calculation       | Interpretation          |
| -------- | ----------------- | ----------------------- |
| **SV**   | EV - PV           | + = ahead, - = behind   |
| **CV**   | EV - AC           | + = under, - = over     |
| **SPI**  | EV / PV           | >1 = ahead, <1 = behind |
| **CPI**  | EV / AC           | >1 = under, <1 = over   |
| **EAC**  | BAC / CPI         | If CPI continues        |
| **ETC**  | EAC - AC          | Remaining cost          |
| **VAC**  | BAC - EAC         | + = under, - = over     |
| **TCPI** | (BAC-EV)/(BAC-AC) | Required efficiency     |

## Exam Tips for Monitoring Questions

::: tip Memory Aid
For SV and CV, remember: "**EV is in Every formula**"
- SV = **EV** - PV
- CV = **EV** - AC
- SPI = **EV** / PV
- CPI = **EV** / AC
:::

### Common Wrong Answer Patterns

- ❌ Confusing SV/CV positive/negative meanings
- ❌ Using wrong EAC formula
- ❌ Skipping impact analysis before approving changes
- ❌ Only capturing lessons at project end
- ❌ Declaring closure without formal acceptance

### Right Answer Patterns

- ✅ Negative variance = unfavorable
- ✅ CPI/SPI < 1 = problem
- ✅ Evaluate changes before approving
- ✅ Capture lessons throughout
- ✅ Get formal deliverable acceptance

::: info Study Note
EVM is heavily tested. Practice calculations until the formulas are automatic. Remember: the indices tell you efficiency (SPI/CPI), while the raw numbers (SV/CV) tell you dollars or time.
