# 9.3 Tools & Templates (Monitoring & Closing Toolkit)

Use this page as a copy/paste toolkit for Monitoring & Controlling and Project Closure scenarios. It’s designed to match how the PMP exam phrases problems (“what should you do first?”).

## 🗓️ Monitoring Cadence (15-Minute Weekly Agenda)

- Progress vs baseline/backlog (milestones, burnup/burndown)
- Variances + trends (CPI/SPI or flow metrics)
- Top risks and issues (new, escalations, owners, due dates)
- Open change requests (status + decisions needed)
- Next week plan (what changes based on what we learned)

::: tip 💡 Exam shortcut
If there is a problem, you usually (1) analyze it, (2) decide an action, and (3) communicate it. “Doing work” without the decision step is often the wrong answer.

## 📣 Status Report Template (Predictive / Hybrid)

**One-page rule**: the sponsor should understand status in under 60 seconds and know what decisions are needed.

| Section | Content (fill-in template) |
|---|---|
| **Overall status (RAG)** | Red / Amber / Green + 1-sentence reason |
| **Accomplished (since last report)** | bullet list |
| **Planned (next period)** | bullet list |
| **Schedule** | milestone status + forecast finish date |
| **Cost** | budget spent + forecast (EAC) if applicable |
| **Key metrics** | CPI/SPI or burnup/CFD + interpretation |
| **Top risks** | risk + owner + next action |
| **Top issues** | issue + owner + due date |
| **Change requests** | CRs submitted/approved + impact summary |
| **Decisions needed** | decision + deadline + decision-maker |

## 📊 EVM Worksheet (Mini Template)

Fill in the inputs, then compute the metrics.

| Input | Value |
|---|---:|
| **BAC** |  |
| **PV** |  |
| **EV** |  |
| **AC** |  |

Quick reminder:
- `PV = % planned complete × BAC`
- `EV = % actually complete × BAC`

| Output | Formula | Result |
|---|---|---:|
| **CV** | $EV - AC$ |  |
| **SV** | $EV - PV$ |  |
| **CPI** | $EV / AC$ |  |
| **SPI** | $EV / PV$ |  |
| **EAC** (typical) | $BAC / CPI$ |  |
| **ETC** | $EAC - AC$ |  |
| **VAC** | $BAC - EAC$ |  |
| **TCPI** | $(BAC - EV)/(BAC - AC)$ |  |

::: info 🔍 Interpretation shortcuts
- **CPI < 1**: over budget; update forecast and analyze root cause.
- **SPI < 1**: behind schedule; confirm critical path impact and remove constraints.
- **TCPI > 1**: you must perform better than planned to hit the target; the higher it is, the less realistic the target is.

## 🧾 Variance Log (Copy/Paste Template)

Use this when variances repeat or exceed thresholds (helps avoid “we saw it but did nothing”).

| Field | Example |
|---|---|
| **Variance ID** | V-007 |
| **Metric** | CPI / milestone slip / defect escape rate |
| **Baseline vs actual** | CPI target 1.0 vs current 0.92 |
| **Trend** | declining for 3 periods |
| **Threshold triggered?** | Yes (below 0.95) |
| **Root cause hypothesis** | rework due to unclear acceptance criteria |
| **Action type** | corrective / preventive / defect repair |
| **Proposed action** | add DoD checklist + story acceptance workshop |
| **Owner** | Delivery lead |
| **Due date** | 2026-02-14 |
| **Requires change request?** | Yes/No (baseline impact?) |
| **Decision** | approved / rejected / deferred |

| **Priority** | High |
| **Owner** | Infrastructure lead |
| **Target resolution date** | 2026-02-05 |
| **Status** | Open / In progress / Resolved / Escalated |
| **Escalation path** | Sponsor if unresolved by date |

::: tip 💡 Exam shortcut
If it is happening **now**, it is usually an **issue** (issue log). If it might happen later, it is a **risk** (risk register).
:::

---

## ⚠️ Risk Register (Monitoring Template)

| Field | Example |
|---|---|
| **Risk ID** | R-013 |
| **Risk (cause → event → impact)** | If vendor lead times increase → hardware arrives late → schedule slip to go-live |

| **Impact** | High |
| **Response strategy** | mitigate / avoid / transfer / accept |
| **Response actions** | pre-order critical parts; add alternate supplier |
| **Owner** | Procurement lead |
| **Trigger** | supplier ETA > 6 weeks |
| **Status** | Open / Monitoring / Triggered / Closed |
| **Residual risk** | remaining delay risk after response |
| **Secondary risks** | e.g., alternate supplier quality risk |
