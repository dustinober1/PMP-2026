# 9.2 – Project Closure

## 9.2.1 Introduction

Project closure is often undervalued but critically important. How you close determines whether lessons are captured, benefits are realized, and stakeholders feel the project was successful.

::: tip Key Insight
**Closure isn't just paperwork**—it's ensuring the organization learns, benefits are realized, and relationships are preserved for future projects.

## 9.2.2 Types of Project Closure

### Normal Closure

Project completed as planned:
- Objectives achieved
- Deliverables accepted
- Benefits transition underway

### Premature Closure

Project ends early due to:
- Changing business strategy
- Benefits no longer achievable
- Resources redirected
- Scope no longer relevant

### Canceled Project Closure

Even canceled projects need proper closure:
- Capture lessons learned
- Document what was accomplished
- Release resources formally
- Archive project information

## 9.2.5 Lessons Learned

### Why Lessons Learned Matter

Without deliberate capture:
- Same mistakes repeat on future projects
- Successful practices are forgotten
- Organizational capability doesn't improve

### Effective Lessons Learned Sessions

| Practice                     | Description                                        |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Facilitate, don't blame**  | Create safe environment                            |
| **Be specific**              | Actionable recommendations, not vague observations |
| **Include all perspectives** | Team, stakeholders, vendors                        |
| **Capture throughout**       | Not just at closing                                |
| **Make accessible**          | Store where future PMs can find                    |

### Lessons Learned Categories

| Category         | Example Questions                              |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Planning**     | Were estimates accurate? Was scope clear?      |
| **Execution**    | What processes worked? What didn't?            |
| **Stakeholders** | Was communication effective?                   |
| **Risk**         | Were risks identified? How did responses work? |
| **Team**         | What helped collaboration? What hindered?      |
| **Tools**        | Which tools added value? Which were overhead?  |

### Making Lessons Actionable

Poor lesson: "Communication was a problem."

Better lesson: "Daily standups using video improved collaboration for remote team members. We recommend this for all distributed teams."

## 9.2.6 Benefits Transition

### Ensuring Benefits Are Realized

Project outputs enable benefits, but benefits are realized in operations:

| Activity               | Purpose                         |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Confirm benefit owners | Who is responsible post-project |
| Establish measurements | How benefits will be tracked    |
| Transfer monitoring    | Operations takes over tracking  |
| Plan review points     | When benefits will be assessed  |

### Transition to Operations

| Element         | Description                                 |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Training        | Operations can support deliverables         |
| Documentation   | Runbooks, procedures, technical docs        |
| Support plan    | How issues will be addressed                |
| Warranty period | Support from project team during transition |

## 9.2.7 Team Recognition and Release

### Celebrating Success

- Acknowledge team contributions publicly
- Thank individual contributors specifically
- Celebrate achievements, even on challenged projects
- Mark the ending formally

### Resource Release

## 9.2.8 Closure in Agile

### Agile Closure Patterns

| Element                  | Description                      |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| **Release closure**      | Specific release marked complete |
| **Sprint retrospective** | Ongoing learning                 |
| **Product closure**      | When product development ends    |

### Continuous vs. Final Closure

Agile projects may have:
- Continuous release and learning
- Product eventually transitions to maintenance
- Team may stay together for next product
