# 9.2 Project Closure (Close Project or Phase)

Closure is not just the end of work; it is the **transfer of value**. In the 2026 PMP exam, your job as a Project Manager ends only when ownership is transferred, obligations are fulfilled, records are archived, and the organization can reuse what you learned.

::: tip 🎯 What the Exam Tests
Closure questions typically target: **formal acceptance**, **handoff/transition readiness**, **procurement closure and claims**, **organizational process asset (OPA) updates**, and what to do when a project is **terminated early**.

## What “Done” Means (Closure Definition)

A project is ready to close when:
- Deliverables are **verified** and **accepted** against documented acceptance criteria.
- Remaining work is **formally canceled or deferred** (don’t leave “secret scope”).
- Contracts are closed and **all claims/disputes are resolved**.
- Project records, performance data, and decisions are archived as **OPAs**.
- Final financials are reconciled and resources are released.
- Lessons learned are captured and transferred to the organization.

## 📦 Key Closure Outputs (What You Produce)

Think of closure as generating a “package of record” for the organization: proof of acceptance, proof of contractual/financial completion, and reusable knowledge.

| Output | Why it matters (exam logic) |
|---|---|
| **Formal acceptance/sign-off** | proves deliverables met acceptance criteria (Validate Scope) |
| **Handoff/transition package** | enables operations to run/support the deliverable (value transfer) |
| **Procurement closure records** | proves contract obligations and payments are complete; closes claims |
| **Final report** | documents results vs objectives, variances, and final performance |
| **Lessons learned register + OPA updates** | transfers reusable knowledge (templates, metrics, decisions, vendor evaluations) |
| **Archived artifacts (PMIS/OPA library)** | preserves baselines, registers/logs, approvals, and decisions for audit/reuse |
| **Resource release + recognition** | formally ends assignments and reinforces culture |
| **Benefits handoff** | assigns who measures benefits after the project is closed |

## 🏁 The Final Protocol (High-Level Checklist)

A project must be closed formally, even if it was terminated early or canceled due to strategic shifts.

## Formal Acceptance (Validate Scope vs Close Project)

- **Validate Scope** is about accepting completed deliverables (often incremental).
- **Close Project or Phase** is the administrative process of finalizing *everything* (records, contracts, transition).

### If the Customer Refuses to Sign Off (High-Scoring Exam Response)

1) **Refer to acceptance criteria** (requirements/backlog + definition of done + contract terms).  
2) **Validate scope** with objective evidence (inspection results, UAT outcomes, traceability).  
3) If criteria were **not** met: log defects/issues and perform **defect repair**.  
4) If criteria **were** met: document the refusal and escalate using the agreed **governance/contract** path (claims/dispute process if applicable).  
5) If the customer wants “extras” not in scope: treat as a **change request**, not as “minor fixes.”  

::: tip 💡 Exam Pattern: “Punch List”
Minor items can be documented as a punch list/warranty items **only if** acceptance criteria are met and the organization/customer agrees to accept with documented follow-up.
:::

## Transition & Handoff (How You Make Value Real)

The “handoff” is where many projects fail in the real world—and where the PMP exam expects you to be rigorous.

Typical handoff components:
- **Transition plan**: who owns what, and when ownership transfers
- **Operations readiness**: support team trained, access provisioned, monitoring/runbooks documented
- **Documentation**: user guides, admin guides, architecture diagrams, configuration items
- **Support model**: warranty period, SLAs, escalation paths, service desk intake
- **Benefits ownership**: who measures benefits after the project is closed (often the product/operations owner)

::: info 🔍 Exam Pattern
If operations cannot support the deliverable (missing training, missing runbooks, missing access), the project is not truly “done,” even if the software “works.”
:::

---

## Closing Procurements (You Can’t Close With Open Claims)

Procurement closure typically includes:
- Formal acceptance of seller deliverables per contract
- Final payments (including retainage) per contract terms
- Closing out open change orders, claims, and disputes
- Procurement audit and vendor performance evaluation (an OPA input)

::: warning ⚠️ Common Exam Trap
If a scenario mentions a **claim/dispute**, you generally **cannot** close the project until it’s resolved (or formally transferred per organizational policy).
:::

---

## Final Report and Administrative Closure (How You Leave the Project “Clean”)

Your final report is the “executive summary of record.” It often includes:
- Original objectives and success criteria vs actual outcomes
- Schedule/cost performance summary (including major variances and approved changes)
- Quality/defect summary and acceptance status
- Final risks/issues disposition (closed vs handed over)
- Benefits handoff: who owns benefits tracking, and when measurement occurs

Archiving typically includes: plans/baselines, registers/logs, change history, approvals, contracts, deliverables, and key decisions.

---

## 🧠 Harvesting Lessons (The Most Valuable Output of Closure)

The **lessons learned register** should be a living document throughout the project and then finalized at closure. A good lessons learned session is **blameless** and action-oriented.

Suggested prompts:
- **What went right?** (repeatable practices)
- **What went wrong?** (root causes and early signals)
- **What should we stop/start/continue?**
- **What assumptions were wrong?**
- **What decisions saved time/cost?**

::: tip 💡 2026 Shift: Canceled Projects
If a project is canceled mid-flight, do not just walk away. Perform administrative closure: document why it was canceled, archive partial deliverables and contracts, and capture lessons so the organization gets value from the failure.

## 🔄 Methodology Nuances

- **Predictive**: closure occurs at the end of each phase and at the final project conclusion (phase-gate acceptance + final closure).
- **Agile**: “closure” happens continuously (reviews + retros). Final closure occurs when the product backlog is satisfied, funding ends, or the product is retired—*and you still do handoff/knowledge transfer*.

  <strong>📝 Exam Insight:</strong> If a project is complete but the customer refuses to sign off due to a "minor issue" not previously defined in the requirements, the PM must <strong>Refer to the Acceptance Criteria</strong>. If the criteria are met, the customer is contractually obligated to accept. If not, you must fix it.
