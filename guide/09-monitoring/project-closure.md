# 9.2 Project Closure

Closure is not just finishing the work; it is **transferring the value**. In the 2026 PMP exam, a Project Manager's job isn't done until the "Operational Owner" has everything they need to succeed and the team has captured their wisdom.

## 🏁 The Closure Checklist
Every project must be formally closed, even if it was canceled early.

### 1. Acceptance
- **Verify Deliverables**: Ensure every item in the Scope Statement has been completed and verified.
- **Formal Sign-off**: Obtain written acceptance from the Sponsor or Customer.

### 2. Transition
- **Handoff to Operations**: Deliver the "Runbook," training, and documentation to the people who will run the product.
- **Benefits Transition**: Identify who will own the tracking of benefits (e.g., ROI, user satisfaction) after the project team is gone.

### 3. Administrative Tasks
- **Close Contracts**: Ensure all vendors are paid and their performance is documented.
- **Release the Team**: Formally return team members to their functional units or next projects.
- **Archive Records**: Store the project's data, plans, and reports according to organizational policy.

## 🧠 Lessons Learned: The Most Important Artifact
The **Lessons Learned Register** is a living document. At closure, it is finalized and uploaded to the **Organizational Process Assets (OPA) Library**.

::: tip 💡 2026 Strategy: Canceled Projects
If your project is canceled because it no longer aligns with strategy, your FIRST action is to **Perform Closure**. You must still archive what was done and capture lessons learned to prevent future waste.

## 🔄 Closure in different environments
- **Predictive**: A formal, phase-based closure at the very end.
- **Agile**: "Closure" happens at the end of every sprint (Retrospectives) and release. However, a final "Product Closure" occurs when the backlog is empty or the funding ends.

  <strong>📝 Exam Insight:</strong> If a project is complete but the customer refuses to sign off on a deliverable because of a "minor issue," the Project Manager should <strong>Address the issue</strong> but work toward a <strong>Conditional Acceptance</strong> if possible, or refer to the <strong>Acceptance Criteria</strong> in the contract.
