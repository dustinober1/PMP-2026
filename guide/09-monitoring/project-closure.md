# 9.2 Project Closure

Closure is not just the end of work; it is the **Transfer of Value**. In the 2026 PMP exam, your job as a Project Manager ends only when the operational owner is fully empowered to succeed and the team's wisdom has been harvested for the enterprise.

## 🏁 The Final Protocol
A project must be closed formally, even if it was terminated early or canceled due to strategic shifts.

## 🧠 Harvesting Lessons
The **Lessons Learned Register** is the most valuable output of closure. It should not be a "blame session" but an objective look at:
- **What went right**: How can we repeat this success?
- **What went wrong**: How can the next PM avoid this trap?
- **Innovations**: What new tools or tricks did we discover?

::: tip 💡 2026 Shift: Canceled Projects
If a project is canceled mid-flight, do not just walk away. Your FIRST duty is to <strong>Perform Administrative Closure</strong>—documenting why it was canceled and archiving the partial deliverables and lessons.

## 🔄 Methodology Nuances
- **Predictive**: Closure occurs at the end of each phase and at the final project conclusion.
- **Agile**: "Closure" is a continuous pulse. Retrospectives provide closure at every sprint, while the final closure occurs when the Product Owner declares the backlog "Satisfied" or funding expires.

  <strong>📝 Exam Insight:</strong> If a project is complete but the customer refuses to sign off due to a "minor issue" not previously defined in the requirements, the PM must <strong>Refer to the Acceptance Criteria</strong>. If the criteria are met, the customer is contractually obligated to accept. If not, you must fix it.
