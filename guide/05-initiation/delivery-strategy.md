# 5.4 Delivery Strategy

One of the most important decisions made during initiation is: *How are we going to build this?* The delivery approach sets the tone for all future planning.

## 🧭 Selecting the Approach
You must match the delivery model to the project's unique characteristics.

| Factor           | Predictive (Waterfall)     | Adaptive (Agile)               |
| :--------------- | :------------------------- | :----------------------------- |
| **Requirements** | Well-defined and stable.   | Evolving and uncertain.        |
| **Risk**         | Low technical uncertainty. | High technical uncertainty.    |
| **Change**       | Cost of change is high.    | Cost of change is low.         |
| **Value**        | Delivered at the very end. | Delivered in small increments. |
| **Complexity**   | Linear and predictable.    | Complex and iterative.         |

Many modern projects use a **Hybrid Approach**. For example, the hardware components are built using a predictive roadmap, while the software features are developed using Agile sprints.

## 🗺️ High-Level Roadmapping
During initiation, you don't need a detailed Gantt chart, but you DO need a **Roadmap**.
- **The Vision**: The long-term goal.
- **Milestones**: Major check-points (e.g., MVP Launch, Beta Testing, Global Rollout).
- **Release Plan**: For Agile projects, a summary of which features (themes) will be in which release.

---

## 🏁 The Kick-off Meeting
Once the charter is signed and the approach is chosen, the project officially "kicks off."
- **Purpose**: Align the team and stakeholders, establish the vision, and set expectations.
- **Timing**:
  - Small projects: Can happen during initiation.
  - Large projects: Usually happens at the end of planning, right before execution starts.
