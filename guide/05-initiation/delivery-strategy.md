# 5.4 Delivery Strategy

**ECO Task**: Determine appropriate project methodology/methods and practices

One of the PM's first "process" decisions is selecting the high-level delivery strategy. In 2026, this is not a religious choice between Scrum or Predictive—it is a logical choice based on **Risk** and **Frequency of Value**.

## 🎯 Decision Framework: Stacey Matrix

The **Stacey Matrix** helps determine complexity based on requirements clarity and technical certainty:

| | **Requirements CLEAR** | **Requirements UNCLEAR** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Technology KNOWN** | **Simple** → Predictive | **Complicated** → Hybrid |
| **Technology UNKNOWN** | **Complicated** → Hybrid | **Complex** → Agile |

### Stacey Matrix Decision Guide

| Zone | Characteristics | Best Approach |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Simple** | Known requirements, proven technology | Predictive with standard processes |
| **Complicated** | Expertise needed, analysis required | Hybrid with expert consultation |
| **Complex** | Emergent patterns, experimentation needed | Agile with empirical loops |
| **Chaotic** | Novel situation, immediate action needed | Rapid response, then stabilize |

## 🔄 Cynefin Framework

Another powerful complexity model for approach selection:

<div class="cynefin-grid">
  <div class="cynefin-card clear">
    <div class="cynefin-title">Clear (Obvious)</div>
    <p><strong>Sense → Categorize → Respond</strong></p>
    <p>Best practices apply. Predictive works well.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="cynefin-card complicated">
    <div class="cynefin-title">Complicated</div>
    <p><strong>Sense → Analyze → Respond</strong></p>
    <p>Expert analysis needed. Hybrid approach.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="cynefin-card complex">
    <div class="cynefin-title">Complex</div>
    <p><strong>Probe → Sense → Respond</strong></p>
    <p>Experimentation required. Agile approach.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="cynefin-card chaotic">
    <div class="cynefin-title">Chaotic</div>
    <p><strong>Act → Sense → Respond</strong></p>
    <p>Crisis mode. Act first, then stabilize.</p>
  </div>

## 🎛️ What the Strategy Choice Changes

Your delivery strategy sets expectations for *how planning, change, and delivery will work*.

| Aspect | Predictive | Agile | Hybrid |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Planning** | Upfront, detailed | Rolling wave, iterative | Phased with iteration |
| **Scope Definition** | WBS, work packages | Product backlog, user stories | Mixed artifacts |
| **Change Handling** | Formal change control | Reprioritization in backlogs | Gates + flexibility |
| **Value Delivery** | Single release | Frequent increments | Staged releases |
| **Progress Measure** | % complete | Working increments | Milestone + velocity |
| **Risk Response** | Planned reserves | Continuous adaptation | Hybrid approach |

::: tip 🧠 Exam Pattern
If stakeholders need **frequent feedback** and requirements are evolving, an adaptive approach is usually best. If the environment is **safety-critical** or **highly regulated**, predictive guardrails increase control and auditability.

## 🛠️ Tailoring Factors

When determining the strategy during initiation, consider the **Tailoring Matrix**:

| Factor | Predictive Indicators | Agile Indicators |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Complexity** | Low, well-understood | High, many unknowns |
| **Risk** | Failure is catastrophic | Can fail fast & learn |
| **Delivery Frequency** | Single release acceptable | Frequent value needed |
| **Resource Model** | Shared resources | Dedicated cross-functional team |
| **Requirements** | Stable, well-defined | Volatile, emerging |
| **Compliance** | Heavy documentation needed | Light documentation acceptable |
| **Stakeholder Availability** | Limited access | Active engagement |
| **External Dependencies** | Vendor lead times critical | Internal focus |

### Tailoring Decision Tree

```
Are requirements stable and well-known?
    ↓
┌───┴───┐
YES      NO
 ↓        ↓
         Is frequent stakeholder feedback possible?
              ↓
         ┌────┴────┐
        YES        NO
         ↓          ↓
        AGILE    HYBRID
 ↓
Is cost of change high (physical, safety)?
    ↓
┌───┴───┐
YES      NO
 ↓        ↓
PREDICTIVE  Consider HYBRID or AGILE

## 🏗️ Common Hybrid Patterns

### Pattern 1: Water-Scrum-Fall
```
Predictive      Agile        Predictive
[Initiation] → [Sprints] → [Deployment]
  Analysis      Execution     Release
```

### Pattern 2: Agile Core with Predictive Milestones
- Fixed milestone dates for governance
- Agile sprints for content delivery
- Scope flexibility within milestones

### Pattern 3: Phased Delivery
- Phase 1: Predictive foundation build
- Phase 2: Agile feature development
- Phase 3: Predictive deployment and cutover

### Pattern 4: Component-Based Hybrid
| Component | Approach | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Infrastructure | Predictive | Stable, well-known |
| Backend Services | Hybrid | Known patterns, some discovery |
| User Interface | Agile | Evolving requirements, frequent feedback |

## 📈 Metrics by Approach

| Approach | Key Metrics |
| --- | --- |
| **Predictive** | Schedule Variance (SV), Cost Variance (CV), CPI, SPI, % Complete |
| **Agile** | Velocity, Sprint Burndown, Release Burnup, Cycle Time, Lead Time |
| **Hybrid** | Milestone achievement + Velocity, Earned Value + Burndown |

## 🧪 Suitability Assessment

### Project Suitability Scorecard

Rate each factor 1-5 and calculate totals:

| Factor | Predictive | Agile |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Requirements stability | +1 per point | -1 per point |
| Customer availability | -1 per point | +1 per point |
| Cost of change | +1 per point | -1 per point |
| Team experience with approach | +1 if familiar | +1 if familiar |
| Regulatory requirements | +1 per point | -1 per point |
| Need for early value | -1 per point | +1 per point |

**Interpretation:**
- Higher Predictive score → Lean Predictive
- Higher Agile score → Lean Agile
- Similar scores → Consider Hybrid

---

::: info 💡 The 2026 Standard
Most modern enterprise projects are **Hybrid**. They use Predictive milestones for the "Business Case" and "Go-Live" while allowing teams to use Agile "Sprints" for execution and refinement.
