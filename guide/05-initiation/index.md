# Chapter 5: Project Initiation

Welcome to Chapter 5 of the PMP Exam Prep 2026 study guide. This chapter focuses on the critical activities that launch a project—developing the business case, creating the project charter, and ensuring proper authorization.

::: info Process Domain
Project initiation is part of the **Process domain**, which represents 41% of the 2026 PMP exam. Understanding how projects are properly initiated provides context for all subsequent planning and execution activities.
:::

## Why This Chapter Matters

Proper initiation sets the foundation for project success:

- **Establishes authority**: The charter formally authorizes the project and PM
- **Defines purpose**: Clarifies why the project exists and what it should achieve
- **Aligns stakeholders**: Creates shared understanding of project objectives
- **Connects to strategy**: Links project to organizational goals and benefits
- **Identifies constraints**: Surfaces initial assumptions, risks, and boundaries
