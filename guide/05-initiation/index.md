# Chapter 5: Project Initiation

Initiation is the "Big Bang" of a project—the transition from a strategic idea to a formal organizational commitment. In the 2026 PMP exam, initiation is about setting the **Project North Star** and ensuring the delivery approach matches the context.

---

## The Initiation Pillars
- **Strategic Justification**: Why does this project deserve internal investment?
- **Formal Authorization**: Establishing the PM's "Social Contract" and power.
- **Context Selection**: Choosing the right delivery approach (Predictive, Agile, or Hybrid).

## The Initiation Questions (Your North Star Checklist)
If you can’t answer these, you aren’t ready to plan.
1.  **Why now?** What business problem/opportunity is driving this?
2.  **Who owns value?** Who funds it, decides, and benefits after delivery?
3.  **What is success?** How will we measure outcomes (not just outputs)?
4.  **What are the boundaries?** Constraints (facts) and assumptions (beliefs).
5.  **How will we deliver?** Predictive vs Agile vs Hybrid—based on risk and uncertainty.

::: info  The Other Initiation Process
While this chapter focuses on authorization and strategy, the **Initiating Process Group** formally includes two processes:
1.  **Develop Project Charter** (Covered here)
2.  **Identify Stakeholders** (Covered in **[Chapter 4: Stakeholder & Communication](/guide/04-stakeholder/)**)

You cannot start a project without knowing who cares about it.

## Key Takeaways
By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
-  **Justify the "Why"**: Use financial metrics and strategic alignment to defend project selection.
-  **Establish Power**: Define the PM's role and authority via the Project Charter.
-  **Set Boundaries**: Distinguish between Assumptions (beliefs) and Constraints (limitations).
-  **Select Approach**: Apply the Tailoring framework to choose Agile vs. Predictive at the start.
