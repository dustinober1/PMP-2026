# 5.3 – Initial Planning and Assumptions

## 5.3.1 Introduction

While detailed planning occurs after a project is authorized, some planning activities begin during initiation to inform the charter and establish a foundation for the project.

::: tip Key Insight
**Initiation involves planning at a high level**. You need enough information to make informed decisions about whether to proceed, without investing in detailed planning for a project that may not be approved.

## 5.3.2 The Assumptions Log

### What Is an Assumptions Log?

The assumptions log documents factors that are believed to be true but haven't been validated. Assumptions carry risk—if they prove false, project plans may need to change.

### Assumptions Log Contents

| Element             | Description                         |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Assumption ID**   | Unique identifier                   |
| **Description**     | What is assumed to be true          |
| **Owner**           | Who is responsible for validating   |
| **Due date**        | When validation should occur        |
| **Status**          | Open, validated, invalidated        |
| **Impact if wrong** | What happens if assumption is false |
| **Related risks**   | Connected risk register entries     |

### Example Assumptions

| Assumption                                    | Owner       | Impact if Wrong        |
| --------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ---------------------- |
| Current system can be modified (not replaced) | Tech Lead   | Major scope change     |
| Key stakeholders available for requirements   | PM          | Requirements delays    |
| Regulatory approval timeline is 60 days       | Legal       | Schedule slip          |
| Vendor contract allows modification           | Procurement | Contract renegotiation |

### Managing Assumptions

1. **Document** assumptions as they're identified
2. **Assign owners** responsible for validation
3. **Set timeframes** for when validation should occur
4. **Monitor** throughout the project
5. **Update plans** if assumptions prove false
6. **Link to risks** when assumptions carry significant uncertainty

## 5.3.3 High-Level Risk Identification

### Why Identify Risks Early?

Early risk identification:
- Informs go/no-go decisions
- Shapes the project approach
- Helps estimate contingency
- Identifies issues that could prevent success

### Initial Risk Categories

| Category           | Examples                               |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| **Technical**      | New technology, integration complexity |
| **Resource**       | Skill availability, competing projects |
| **Schedule**       | Aggressive timeline, dependencies      |
| **Stakeholder**    | Resistance, conflicting requirements   |
| **External**       | Regulatory changes, market shifts      |
| **Organizational** | Restructuring, priority changes        |

### Risk Assessment at Initiation

| Risk                  | Probability | Impact | Initial Response       |
| --------------------- | ----------- | ------ | ---------------------- |
| Technology not proven | Medium      | High   | Proof of concept first |
| Key resource leaves   | Low         | High   | Cross-training plan    |
| Requirements unstable | High        | Medium | Agile approach         |
| Budget insufficient   | Medium      | High   | Phase approach         |

Detailed risk analysis occurs during planning, but high-level assessment informs initiation decisions.

## 5.3.4 Initial Stakeholder Identification

### Early Stakeholder Work

During initiation, identify:
- **Key stakeholders** who must be engaged immediately
- **Sponsor** and their expectations
- **Core team** members needed for startup
- **Governance** bodies that will oversee the project

### Initial Stakeholder Register

| Stakeholder | Role                | Interest             | Influence | Initial Engagement    |
| ----------- | ------------------- | -------------------- | --------- | --------------------- |
| CFO         | Sponsor             | Budget, ROI          | High      | Weekly briefings      |
| IT Director | Resource provider   | Technical approach   | High      | Core team meetings    |
| End Users   | Requirements source | Usability            | Medium    | Requirements sessions |
| Compliance  | Governance          | Regulatory adherence | High      | Phase gate reviews    |

Detailed stakeholder analysis expands this during planning.

## 5.3.5 Project Approach Selection

### Choosing the Right Approach

During initiation, determine the overall project approach:

| Factor                   | Favors Predictive    | Favors Agile           |
| ------------------------ | -------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Requirements clarity     | Clear, stable        | Unclear, evolving      |
| Delivery frequency       | Single delivery      | Incremental delivery   |
| Change expectation       | Low change           | High change            |
| Stakeholder availability | Periodic involvement | Continuous involvement |
| Risk tolerance           | Low tolerance        | Higher tolerance       |
| Regulation               | Heavily regulated    | Less regulated         |

### Hybrid Considerations

Many projects use hybrid approaches:
- Predictive governance with agile execution
- Agile core development with predictive integration testing
- Fixed milestones with flexible scope within releases

## 5.3.6 Initial Team Formation

### Startup Team

The initial team may differ from the full project team:

| Phase                   | Team Focus                                |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Pre-charter**         | Business analysts, subject matter experts |
| **Charter development** | PM, key stakeholders, technical leads     |
| **Planning startup**    | Core team members needed for planning     |
| **Full execution**      | Complete project team                     |

### Authority and Roles

Clarify early:
- Who has decision authority for what
- Reporting relationships during the project
- Team member time commitment
- Escalation paths

## 5.3.7 Initial Success Metrics

### Defining "Done" for the Project

During initiation, establish:

| Metric Type           | Example                          |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Outcome metrics**   | 20% reduction in processing time |
| **Delivery metrics**  | All requirements implemented     |
| **Quality metrics**   | < 5 critical defects at launch   |
| **Adoption metrics**  | 80% user adoption within 90 days |
| **Financial metrics** | Positive ROI within 18 months    |

### Leading vs. Lagging Indicators

| Leading (Predictive)         | Lagging (After the Fact) |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Sprint velocity trend        | Final project cost       |
| Requirements completion rate | Benefits realized        |
| Risk mitigation progress     | Customer satisfaction    |

Use leading indicators during the project to predict outcomes before it's too late to adjust.
