# Knowledge Check: Project Initiation

Test your understanding of business cases, project charters, and project selection methods.

## Practice Questions

### Question 1: Business Case Purpose

What is the PRIMARY purpose of a business case?

- A) To authorize the project manager
- B) To justify the project investment ✓
- C) To define detailed requirements
- D) To create the project schedule

**Explanation**: The business case justifies why the organization should invest in the project. It's created BEFORE the project is authorized.

### Question 2: NPV Interpretation

You are comparing three projects. Project A has NPV of $150,000, Project B has NPV of $200,000, and Project C has NPV of -$50,000. If you can only choose one, which should you select?

- A) Project A
- B) Project B ✓
- C) Project C
- D) Cannot determine from this information

**Explanation**: When comparing projects using NPV, higher is better. Project B has the highest positive NPV ($200K), indicating it adds the most value.

---

### Question 3: Project Charter Authorization

Who typically signs and approves the project charter?

- A) Project Manager
- B) PMO Director
- C) Project Sponsor ✓
- D) Functional Manager

**Explanation**: The sponsor (or organizational leadership) signs and approves the charter. The PM may help develop it, but authorization comes from organizational leadership.

---

### Question 4: Charter Content

Which of the following is typically included in a project charter?

- A) Detailed work breakdown structure
- B) Complete risk register
- C) High-level scope and objectives ✓
- D) Detailed project schedule

**Explanation**: The charter contains high-level information (scope, objectives, milestones, budget summary), not detailed planning documents like WBS or complete schedules.

---

### Question 5: Payback Period

Project A requires $100,000 investment and returns $25,000 per year. Project B requires $80,000 and returns $20,000 per year. Which has the shorter payback period?

- A) Project A (4 years) ✓
- B) Project B (4 years)
- C) Both are equal ✓
- D) Cannot determine

**Explanation**: Project A: $100K ÷ $25K = 4 years. Project B: $80K ÷ $20K = 4 years. Both have equal payback periods of 4 years.

---

### Question 6: Sunk Costs

Your project has already spent $300,000 and is clearly failing. The remaining work will cost $200,000 with uncertain benefits. A team member argues "We can't stop now—we've already invested $300,000!" What's wrong with this reasoning?

- A) The $300K should be recovered from the vendor
- B) Sunk costs should not influence future decisions ✓
- C) The project should continue to protect the investment
- D) The sponsor must approve stopping

**Explanation**: Sunk costs are already spent and cannot be recovered. Future decisions should be based on future costs and benefits, not past spending.

---

### Question 7: Opportunity Cost

You have budget for one project. Project A has expected value of $100K, Project B has $150K, and Project C has $80K. You choose Project B. What is your opportunity cost?

- A) $80K
- B) $100K ✓
- C) $150K
- D) $230K

**Explanation**: Opportunity cost is the value of the next best alternative foregone. By choosing B, you gave up A ($100K), which is your opportunity cost.

---

### Question 8: Assumptions

Which statement best describes project assumptions?

- A) Facts that have been verified and proven
- B) Factors believed to be true without proof ✓
- C) Constraints imposed on the project
- D) Risks that have been identified

**Explanation**: Assumptions are factors considered true without proof. They carry risk—if wrong, plans may need to change. They should be documented and validated.

---

### Question 9: Success Criteria

According to modern project management practices, project success should be measured by:

- A) Meeting scope, schedule, and budget only
- B) Completing all deliverables
- C) Value delivered and stakeholder satisfaction ✓
- D) Following defined processes

**Explanation**: The 2026 exam emphasizes value delivery beyond the triple constraint. Success includes benefits realized and stakeholder satisfaction, not just deliverables completed on time/budget.

---

### Question 10: BCR Interpretation

A project has a Benefit-Cost Ratio (BCR) of 0.8. What does this indicate?

- A) The project should be accepted
- B) The project costs exceed benefits ✓
- C) The project has 80% chance of success
- D) The project will pay back in 0.8 years

**Explanation**: BCR < 1 means costs exceed benefits. A BCR of 0.8 means for every $1 of cost, you only get $0.80 of benefit. Generally, this project should be rejected.
