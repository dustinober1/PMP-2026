    {
      text: 'You are helping a sponsor choose between two projects. Project Alpha has an NPV of $50,000 and an IRR of 12%. Project Beta has an NPV of $75,000 and an IRR of 8%. Which project should you recommend solely based on financial value?',
      options: [
        'Project Alpha, because the higher IRR indicates a better interest rate',
        'Project Beta, because NPV is the superior metric for total value realization',
        'Neither, as you must wait for the Payback Period to be calculated',
        'Both projects should be initiated simultaneously'
      ],
      correct: 1,
      explanation: 'Net Present Value (NPV) is the primary project selection metric in the PMP syllabus. Higher NPV indicates a larger total value contribution to the organization.',
      reference: 'Section 5.1'
    },
    {
      text: 'A functional manager and the project manager are in a dispute over resource allocation. The functional manager claims the project has not been formally approved. What document should the PM show to resolve this?',
      options: [
        'The Business Case',
        'The Project Management Plan',
        'The Project Charter',
        'The Communications Management Plan'
      ],
      correct: 2,
      explanation: 'The Project Charter is the formal document that authorizes the project and names the PM, granting them authority to use organizational resources.',
      reference: 'Section 5.2'
    },
    {
      text: 'During a kick-off meeting, a stakeholder asks for the specific daily tasks of the engineering team for the next six months. The project has just been chartered. What should the PM do?',
      options: [
        'Refer them to the Project Charter schedule',
        'Explain that the charter only contains summary milestones and detailed planning will follow',
        'Draft a Gantt chart immediately to satisfy the stakeholder',
        'Ask the engineering lead to provide their personal calendar'
      ],
      correct: 1,
      explanation: 'The Project Charter is a high-level document. It contains summary milestones, not detailed task lists. Detailed planning occurs AFTER initiation.',
      reference: 'Section 5.2'
    },
    {
      text: 'A Project Manager is documenting that the project relies on the availability of a specific cloud server by July. Since the contract is not yet signed, how should this be classified in the log?',
      options: [
        'As a Constraint, because it is a fixed requirement',
        'As an Assumption, because it is believed to be true for planning but not yet proven',
        'As a Risk Response, because it addresses a budget deficit',
        'As a Quality Metric, because it impacts speed'
      ],
      correct: 1,
      explanation: 'Assumptions are items held to be true for planning purposes without proof. If the server is not yet contracted/guaranteed, it is an assumption.',
      reference: 'Section 5.3'
    },
    {
      text: 'The Project Sponsor asks the PM why they have chosen a Hybrid approach for a new product launch. Which response best aligns with the 2026 PMP mindset?',
      options: [
        'Hybrid is used because it allows us to avoid the complexity of full documentation',
        'Hybrid allows us to use stable predictive dates for the launch event while iterating on feature value via agile cycles',
        'Hybrid is only for projects where the team is too small for Scrum',
        'Hybrid is the default approach for all projects regardless of context'
      ],
      correct: 1,
      explanation: 'The modern justification for Hybrid is balancing fixed business constraints (dates/budgets) with the need for flexible, high-value delivery of content.',
      reference: 'Section 5.4'
    }

## Additional Study Topics
For full Chapter 5 proficiency, ensure you can:
1.  **Select the correct metric**: NPV vs BCR vs IRR.
2.  **Sequence the Start**: Why the Charter usually happens before the Register.
3.  **Audit the Log**: Knowing when to promote an Assumption to a Risk.
4.  **Identify the Authority**: The difference between a Sponsor (Authority/Funding) and a PM (Leadership/Execution).
