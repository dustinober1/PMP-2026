      text: 'Your project has already spent $200,000. It is now realized that the project will likely fail to meet its objectives. A team member says, "We have to finish! We can\'t waste that $200,000!" What economic concept are they ignoring?',
      options: ['The Law of Diminishing Returns', 'Sunk Costs', 'Opportunity Cost', 'The Time Value of Money'],
      correct: 1,
      explanation: 'Sunk Costs are past costs that cannot be recovered and should NOT be considered when deciding whether to continue a project.',

      text: 'You are starting a project where the requirements are extremely stable and the technology is well-known. Which delivery strategy is MOST likely appropriate?',
