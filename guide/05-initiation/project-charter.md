# 5.2 – Project Charter

## 5.2.1 Introduction

The project charter is the document that formally authorizes a project and gives the project manager authority to apply organizational resources to project activities. It's one of the most important documents in project management.

::: tip Key Insight
**The charter authorizes the project AND the project manager**. Without a charter (or equivalent), you don't officially have a project or authority to lead it.

## 5.2.2 Purpose of the Project Charter

### What the Charter Does

| Function                    | Description                                     |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Authorizes the project**  | Formal "go" decision from the organization      |
| **Empowers the PM**         | Gives PM authority to use resources             |
| **Links to strategy**       | Connects project to organizational objectives   |
| **Defines boundaries**      | Establishes high-level scope and constraints    |
| **Identifies stakeholders** | Names key players and their roles               |
| **Creates alignment**       | Ensures shared understanding among stakeholders |

### Charter vs. Other Documents

| Document                    | Purpose                | When Created   | Who Creates               |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Business Case**           | Justify the investment | Before project | Business owner            |
| **Project Charter**         | Authorize the project  | Initiating     | Sponsor (with PM support) |
| **Project Management Plan** | Detail how to execute  | Planning       | Project manager           |

## 5.2.3 Who Creates and Approves the Charter?

### Typical Roles

| Role                | Responsibility                      |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Sponsor**         | Signs and approves the charter      |
| **Project Manager** | Develops charter content (often)    |
| **Business Owner**  | Provides business requirements      |
| **PMO**             | May provide templates and standards |

### Key Point

The **sponsor** (or initiator) formally issues the charter. The PM may draft it, but authorization comes from organizational leadership.

## 5.2.4 Project Charter Components

### Standard Charter Elements

| Component                      | Description                              |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Project purpose**            | Why the project exists                   |

| **Exit criteria**              | Conditions for project closure           |

### SMART Objectives

Project objectives should be:

| Attribute      | Description         | Example                            |
| -------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **S**pecific   | Clear and precise   | "Reduce processing time"           |
| **M**easurable | Quantifiable        | "by 30%"                           |
| **A**chievable | Realistic           | (within current capabilities)      |
| **R**elevant   | Aligned to strategy | "to improve customer satisfaction" |
| **T**ime-bound | Has deadline        | "by December 31, 2026"             |

---

## 5.2.5 High-Level Scope

### What to Include

The charter contains **high-level** scope, not detailed scope:

| Include                      | Don't Include             |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Major deliverables           | Detailed WBS              |
| Key features or capabilities | All requirements          |
| Boundaries (in/out of scope) | Technical specifications  |
| Acceptance criteria overview | Detailed acceptance tests |

### In-Scope vs. Out-of-Scope

Explicitly stating what's NOT included helps manage expectations:

| In Scope            | Out of Scope                             |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| New customer portal | Mobile app (future phase)                |
| User migration      | Legacy system decommissioning            |
| 12-month support    | Ongoing maintenance after support period |

## 5.2.6 Assumptions and Constraints

### Assumptions

Assumptions are factors considered true without proof:

| Example                          | Risk if Wrong                      |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Key SME available 50%            | Delays if unavailable              |
| Regulatory approval by Q3        | Schedule impact if delayed         |
| Current vendor continues service | Need alternative if vendor changes |

**Key practice**: Document assumptions in an assumptions log and validate throughout the project.

### Constraints

Constraints are limiting factors:

| Constraint Type | Example                           |
| --------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Time**        | Must launch before holiday season |
| **Cost**        | Budget capped at $500K            |
| **Scope**       | Must comply with regulation X     |
| **Resource**    | Only 5 developers available       |
| **Quality**     | Must meet ISO 9001 standards      |

## 5.2.7 Initial Risk Identification

### High-Level Risks in Charter

The charter should identify major risks:

| Risk                   | Impact            | Initial Response                |
| ---------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Technology immaturity  | Schedule, quality | Prototype early                 |
| Resource availability  | Schedule          | Identify backup resources       |
| Stakeholder resistance | Adoption          | Change management plan          |
| Regulatory uncertainty | Scope, schedule   | Monitor regulatory developments |

Detailed risk analysis occurs during planning, but high-level risks inform charter development.

## 5.2.8 Success Criteria

### Defining Success

Success criteria establish how the project will be evaluated:

| Category                     | Criteria Examples                          |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Scope**                    | All deliverables accepted per requirements |
| **Schedule**                 | Delivered within approved timeline (±10%)  |
| **Cost**                     | Completed within approved budget (±5%)     |
| **Quality**                  | Meets defined quality standards            |
| **Benefits**                 | Achieves defined business outcomes         |
| **Stakeholder satisfaction** | Key stakeholders accept outcomes           |

### Beyond Triple Constraint

The 2026 exam emphasizes **value delivery**, not just scope/time/cost:
- Did the project achieve its intended benefits?
- Are stakeholders satisfied?
- Was value delivered?

## 5.2.9 Charter in Agile Projects

### Agile Approach to Initiation

Agile projects still need authorization, but the approach may differ:

| Traditional Charter       | Agile Approach                          |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Detailed objectives       | Vision and goals                        |
| Fixed scope               | Product backlog (prioritized, flexible) |
| Milestone schedule        | Release plan with iterations            |
| Fixed budget              | Time-boxed funding                      |
| Detailed success criteria | Value-focused outcomes                  |

### Agile Charter Elements

- **Product vision**: What we're building and why
- **Definition of Done**: When work is considered complete
- **Team composition**: Who's on the team
- **Initial backlog**: Priority features to start
- **Release targets**: High-level timeline goals

## 5.2.10 Key Takeaways

1. **Charter authorizes project and PM**: Without it, no formal authority
2. **Sponsor signs, PM often drafts**: Know the roles
3. **High-level content**: Charter isn't the detailed plan
4. **SMART objectives**: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound
5. **Document assumptions**: They become risks if proven false
6. **Define success criteria**: Beyond scope/time/cost to value delivery
7. **Agile adapts, doesn't skip**: Agile projects still need authorization
