# 5.2 The Project Charter

The **Project Charter** is the birth certificate of the project. Without it, the project does not legally exist within the organization.

---

## 🏛️ Purpose of the Charter
1. **Formal Authorization**: Validates the project's existence.
2. **PM Authority**: Explicitly names the Project Manager and grants them the power to use organizational resources.
3. **High-Level Alignment**: Ensures the Sponsor and PM are on the same page regarding the project's "Why."

| Component                 | Description                                             |
| :------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Project Purpose**       | The 'mission statement' derived from the business case. |
| **Success Criteria**      | Measurable goals: "What does done and good look like?"  |
| **High-Level Scope**      | Boundaries of the project.                              |
| **Total Approved Budget** | The initial funding ceiling.                            |
| **High-Level Risks**      | Significant threats identified at the start.            |
| **Summary Milestones**    | Key dates for the roadmap.                              |
| **Stakeholder List**      | Key influencers known at the start.                     |
| **Sponsor Sign-off**      | The signature that makes it official.                   |

::: info 🛠️ 2026 Focus: Collaborative Drafting
While the **Sponsor** is technically responsible for issued the charter, in modern practice, the **Project Manager** often helps draft it. This ensures the PM has early buy-in and a deep understanding of the project's constraints.

## 🛑 What the Charter is NOT
- **A detailed Project Management Plan**: It is high-level.
- **A contract with a vendor**: It is an internal organizational document.
- **Set in stone**: If the business case changes, the charter may need revision (though this should be rare).

  <strong>📝 Exam Insight:</strong> If an exam scenario says a functional manager refuses to provide a resource because they don't believe the project is a priority, the Project Manager should <strong>show them the Project Charter</strong> to demonstrate their formal authority.
