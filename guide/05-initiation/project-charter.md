# 5.2 The Project Charter

The **Project Charter** is the "Birth Certificate" of the project. It is the formal document that authorizes the project manager to exist and use company resources.

## 🏛️ The PM's Source of Power
The Charter is not just paperwork; it is the foundation of your authority. Without an approved charter, you are just a person with an idea, not a Project Manager.

## 🧠 The Charter as an Initiation Gate
On the exam, the charter is the “start line.” It tells you:
- **The organization is committing resources**
- **You are authorized to lead**
- **Planning can begin**

### Common Inputs (What Feeds the Charter)
*   **Business Case / Benefits Management Plan**: The value justification and how benefits will be measured.
*   **Agreements**: Contracts, MOUs (Memorandums of Understanding), or SLAs (Service Level Agreements). If you are doing work for an external customer, the **Contract** precedes the Charter.
*   **Enterprise Environmental Factors (EEF)**: *Conditions not under your control.*
    *   *Examples*: Market conditions, government regulations, AI governance policies, organizational culture, remote work infrastructure.
*   **Organizational Process Assets (OPA)**: *Processes and knowledge bases you can use.*
    *   *Examples*: Templates, historical data (lessons learned), standard policies, financial control procedures.

::: tip 🧠 EEF vs. OPA Hint
If it **constrains** you (laws, culture, systems), it's an **EEF**.
If it **helps** you (templates, prior project files), it's an **OPA**.
:::

::: warning 🚦 Exam Trap: “Start Work Immediately”
If you’re asked to begin execution (hire vendors, build deliverables, spend budget) **without an approved charter**, the best next step is to **work with the sponsor to finalize and approve the charter**.

## 📋 Standard Charter Components
While every company has its own template, the PMP exam expects these core elements:

*   **Project Purpose**: The "Why" (linked to the Business Case).
*   **Success Criteria**: Measurable goals (e.g., "Launch by Q3 with <5% defect rate").
*   **High-Level Requirements**: The "Big Picture" constraints.
*   **High-Level Risks**: Known threats identified during initiation.
*   **Summary Milestone Schedule**: Major phase endpoints.
*   **Pre-approved Budget**: The high-level funding envelope.
*   **Key Stakeholder List**: Who cares? (Sponsor, Customers, Functional Managers).
*   **Assumptions & Constraints**: The project boundaries.

::: info 🛠️ 2026 Shift: Collaborative Evolution
Traditional PMBOK implies the Sponsor writes the charter. In modern 2026 practice, the **Project Manager** often drafts it in collaboration with the Sponsor. This ensures the PM has empathy for the business goals before planning starts.

## 🏃 Agile Chartering: The "Elevator Pitch"
In Adaptive/Agile environments, the charter is often lighter and focused on **Vision**.
*   **Vision Statement**: "For [target customer], who [statement of need], the [product name] is a [product category] that [key benefit]."
*   **Mission**: What are we doing *now* to achieve the vision?
*   **Success Criteria**: Often expressed as **OKRs** (Objectives and Key Results) rather than fixed scope.

## 🔍 Charter vs Other Documents
| Document | What It’s For | What It’s Not For |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Project Charter** | Authorization + high-level guardrails | Detailed plan, schedule baseline, task list |
| **Project Management Plan** | Execution strategy + baselines | Formal authorization to exist |
| **Business Case** | Investment justification (value) | Assigning the PM authority |
| **Contract / SOW** | External deliverables and legal obligations | Internal governance and PM authority |

## 🛑 What a Charter is NOT
1.  **A detailed plan**: No task lists or day-by-day schedules here.
2.  **A contract**: It is an internal organizational document.
3.  **Static**: While it doesn't change often, if the business case evaporates, the charter must be reassessed.
