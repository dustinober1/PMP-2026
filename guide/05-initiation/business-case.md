# 5.1 Business Case & Selection

Before a project is authorized, it must be justified. The organization needs to know: *Is this worth the investment?*

## 📄 The Business Case
The Business Case is a pre-project document that provides the economic feasibility study. It answers the "Why?"
- **Business Need**: What problem are we solving?
- **Strategic Alignment**: How does this map to our 2026 goals?
- **Benefits**: What value will be realized?
- **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Do the rewards outweigh the risks?

## 📊 Project Selection Metrics
The exam will expect you to understand which project to pick based on financial data.

| Metric                            | What it Tells You                    | Rule of Thumb                        |
| :-------------------------------- | :----------------------------------- | :----------------------------------- |
| **NPV (Net Present Value)**       | Total value today minus costs.       | **Higher is better.**                |
| **IRR (Internal Rate of Return)** | The interest rate of the project.    | **Higher is better.**                |
| **BCR (Benefit-Cost Ratio)**      | Ratio of benefit vs cost.            | **Higher than 1.0 is good.**         |
| **Payback Period**                | How long until we break even?        | **Shorter is better.**               |
| **Opportunity Cost**              | The value of the project NOT chosen. | Value of the "Project B" you let go. |

::: warning 🚦 Exam Trap: NPV vs. Payback
If an exam scenario asks you to pick between Project A (Payback in 2 years, NPV $10k) and Project B (Payback in 3 years, NPV $50k), **pick Project B**. NPV is almost always the superior decision-making metric.

## 🛠️ The Benefits Management Plan
Often paired with the Business Case, this document defines *how* and *when* benefits will be delivered and measured.
- **Target Benefits**: Intangible and tangible value.
- **Strategic Alignment**: Contribution to KPIs.
- **Timeline**: When will the value show up 2026-2027?
- **Benefit Owner**: Who is accountable for realization after the project ends?

  <strong>📝 Exam Insight:</strong> If an exam scenario says a project is no longer aligned with organizational strategy, the Project Manager should consult the <strong>Business Case</strong> and <strong>Project Sponsor</strong> to evaluate if the project should be terminated or pivoted.
