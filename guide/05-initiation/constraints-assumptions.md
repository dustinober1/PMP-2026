# 5.3 Constraints & Assumptions

Every project operates within a "Box." **Constraints** are the walls of that box, and **Assumptions** are factors that you treat as true without proof—until you can prove them.

## ⛓️ Constraints: The Unchangeable Limits
A constraint is a limiting factor that affects the execution of a project.
- **Schedule**: The project *must* be done by December 31st for a regulatory deadline.
- **Budget**: You have $500,000 and not a penny more.
- **Scope**: You must use the specific legacy database; you cannot buy a new one.
- **Resources**: You only have 3 developers, and they are shared with another project.

::: tip 💡 Pro Tip: The Triple Constraint
Recall the **Triple Constraint** (Section 1.4b). A change in one constraint almost always forces a change in another. If the schedule is moved up, the budget or quality must likely change to compensate.

## 🌫️ Assumptions: The "Known Unknowns"
An assumption is a factor that, for planning purposes, is considered to be true, real, or certain without proof or demonstration.
- **Example**: "We assume the vendor will deliver the API by May 1st."
- **The Catch**: Assumptions are a major source of **Risk**. If an assumption turns out to be false, it can derail your plan.

## 📊 The Assumptions Log
This is a project document used to record all assumptions and constraints throughout the project lifecycle.
1. **Identify**: "What are we taking for granted?"
2. **Document**: Write it down with a "proof date" (when we'll know if it's true).
3. **Analyze**: What happens to our plan if this assumption is false?
4. **Monitor**: Check the status of assumptions during every team sync.

  <strong>📝 Exam Insight:</strong> If an exam scenario says a project is at risk because a key piece of information wasn't verified, the root cause is likely that the info was treated as an <strong>Assumption</strong> but was never <strong>validated</strong> or tracked in the <strong>Assumptions Log</strong>.
