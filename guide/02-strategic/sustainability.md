## 🌍 What is Sustainable Project Management?

Sustainable project management means delivering project outcomes that create value not just for the organization, but for **people, planet, and prosperity**—without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs.

### The Triple Bottom Line (TBL)

| Dimension | Focus | Project Impact |
|-----------|-------|----------------|
| **People** (Social) | Stakeholder well-being, community impact, equity | Fair labor practices, accessibility, diversity |
| **Planet** (Environmental) | Resource consumption, emissions, biodiversity | Carbon footprint, waste reduction, green materials |
| **Profit** (Economic) | Financial viability, long-term value | Cost efficiency, sustainable revenue, risk mitigation |

::: info 📝 Exam Insight
When a scenario mentions "long-term impact," "environmental considerations," or "community effects," look for answers that consider all three dimensions—not just the financial bottom line.

## 📐 The P5 Framework (GPM Standard)

PMI partners with Green Project Management (GPM) and uses the **P5 Framework** to assess sustainability across five dimensions:

| P5 Element | Description | Example Questions to Ask |
|------------|-------------|-------------------------|
| **Product** | Sustainability of deliverables | Is the product recyclable? Energy efficient? |
| **Process** | How work is conducted | Are we minimizing travel? Using renewable energy? |
| **People** | Social impacts | Are workers treated fairly? Is the community benefiting? |
| **Planet** | Environmental impacts | What's our carbon footprint? Waste generation? |
| **Prosperity** | Economic sustainability | Does this create lasting value? Local economic impact? |

### P5 Integration Throughout Project Lifecycle

```
Initiation → Sustainability goals in business case & charter
Planning → P5 Impact Assessment; Sustainability Management Plan
Execution → Green procurement; waste minimization; carbon tracking
Monitoring → Sustainability KPIs; ESG reporting
Closing → Benefits review; lessons learned; long-term impact assessment
```

## 📊 ESG in Project Management

**ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance)** criteria are increasingly used by organizations to evaluate projects and investments.

### Environmental Factors

- **Carbon footprint** of project activities and deliverables
- **Resource consumption** (water, energy, raw materials)
- **Waste management** and circular economy principles
- **Biodiversity** impact and protection
- **Pollution prevention** and emissions reduction

### Social Factors

- **Labor practices** and worker safety
- **Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI)**
- **Community engagement** and local impact
- **Human rights** in supply chain
- **Stakeholder well-being** and quality of life

### Governance Factors

- **Ethical decision-making** and transparency
- **Anti-corruption** policies
- **Regulatory compliance**
- **Stakeholder accountability**
- **Risk management** including climate risk

::: warning ⚠️ Exam Trap
Don't confuse project governance (how the project is managed) with ESG governance (broader organizational ethics and accountability). The 2026 exam tests both concepts.

## 🔧 Sustainability Tools and Techniques

### 1. Sustainability Impact Assessment (SIA)

Evaluate potential environmental, social, and economic impacts before project decisions.

| Assessment Type | Focus | When to Use |
|-----------------|-------|-------------|
| **Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA)** | Ecological effects | Construction, infrastructure, manufacturing |
| **Social Impact Assessment** | Community and stakeholder effects | Public projects, policy changes |
| **Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)** | Cradle-to-grave product impact | Product development, procurement |

### 2. Carbon Footprint Calculation

Track greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across three scopes:

| Scope | Definition | Project Examples |
|-------|------------|------------------|
| **Scope 1** | Direct emissions (owned/controlled sources) | Company vehicles, on-site fuel combustion |
| **Scope 2** | Indirect emissions from purchased energy | Electricity, heating, cooling |
| **Scope 3** | All other indirect emissions (value chain) | Business travel, purchased materials, waste disposal |

### 3. Sustainability Management Plan (SMP)

A formal document that integrates sustainability into project planning:

**Key Components:**
- Sustainability objectives and targets
- P5 impact assessment results
- Mitigation strategies for negative impacts
- Sustainability KPIs and measurement methods
- Roles and responsibilities (who owns sustainability?)
- Reporting requirements (ESG disclosures)
- Stakeholder communication approach

### 4. Green Procurement

Apply sustainability criteria to vendor selection and purchasing:

| Criterion | Question | Metric |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| **Environmental** | Does supplier have environmental certifications? | ISO 14001, carbon neutral certification |
| **Social** | Are labor practices ethical? | Fair trade certification, labor audits |
| **Local** | Can we source locally to reduce transport? | Distance, local economic impact |
| **Circular** | Can materials be recycled or reused? | Recyclability %, take-back programs |

## 📈 Sustainability Metrics and KPIs

### Environmental KPIs

| Metric | Description | Target Example |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| **Carbon intensity** | CO2 per unit of output | 50% reduction by project end |
| **Energy efficiency** | Energy used per deliverable | 20% improvement vs. baseline |
| **Waste diversion rate** | % waste recycled/reused | 90% diversion from landfill |
| **Water consumption** | Liters per unit of activity | 30% reduction |

### Social KPIs

| Metric | Description | Target Example |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| **Safety incidents** | Recordable injuries | Zero harm |
| **Diversity representation** | Team composition | 40% underrepresented groups |
| **Community investment** | Local hiring, contributions | 25% local suppliers |
| **Stakeholder satisfaction** | Community feedback scores | NPS > 30 |

### Financial Sustainability KPIs

| Metric | Description | Target Example |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| **Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)** | Full lifecycle cost | 15% lower than alternatives |
| **Sustainable ROI** | Return including externalities | Positive when social costs included |
| **Risk-adjusted value** | Value accounting for sustainability risks | Climate-adjusted NPV positive |

## 🎯 Sustainability in Project Decisions

### Decision Framework: Sustainability Integration

When making project decisions, apply this checklist:

1. **Impact Assessment**: What are the environmental, social, and economic impacts?
2. **Alternatives Analysis**: Are there more sustainable options?
3. **Stakeholder Input**: Have affected communities been consulted?
4. **Long-term View**: What are the impacts beyond project completion?
5. **Trade-off Analysis**: How do we balance short-term costs vs. long-term benefits?
6. **Regulatory Compliance**: Do we meet current and anticipated regulations?
7. **Risk Consideration**: What sustainability-related risks exist?

### Common PMP Exam Scenarios

| Scenario | Sustainability-Focused Response |
|----------|--------------------------------|
| Cheaper supplier with poor labor practices | Evaluate total cost including reputational risk; consider ethical sourcing |
| Client pushes for faster timeline using more resources | Analyze environmental impact of acceleration; propose sustainable alternatives |
| Budget pressure to cut sustainability features | Quantify long-term value; escalate to sponsor with impact analysis |
| Community opposition to project | Increase engagement; conduct social impact assessment; adapt approach |

::: tip 💡 Exam Strategy
When a scenario describes conflict between cost/schedule and sustainability, the best answer usually involves **transparent communication**, **stakeholder engagement**, and **finding balanced solutions**—not simply choosing one over the other.
