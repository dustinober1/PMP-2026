# 2.1 Strategic Alignment

Strategic alignment is the discipline of selecting, prioritizing, and governing projects to maximize organizational value. It ensures that the **right work** gets done in the first place and stays relevant as the business environment shifts.

## 🔭 The Strategic Lens
Great project management isn't just about executing work efficiently; it's about connecting every technical decision to an organizational objective. alignment occurs at three distinct levels:

1.  **Portfolio Level**: Selecting the right mix of projects to achieve strategic goals.
2.  **Program Level**: Managing interdependencies to realize synergistic benefits.
3.  **Project Level**: Delivering specific outputs that contribute to the broader vision.

## 📈 Practical Application: Continuous Validation
Strategic alignment is not a "set it and forget it" activity. In 2026, PMs must perform **continuous validation**:

*   **PESTLE Monitoring**: Regularly scanning the External Environment (Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal, Environmental) for shifts that impact project viability.
*   **Pivot or Persevere**: Having the courage to recommend project cancellation or redirection if strategic alignment is lost.

::: tip 💡 Case Study: The Pivot
Six months into her expense system project, Sarah's organization acquired a competitor with a similar system. Suddenly, her "strategic alignment" changed from building a new system to integrating with an existing one. This ability to pivot based on a changing business environment is a core 2026 PMP competency.
