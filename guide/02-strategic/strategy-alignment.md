# 2.1 – Strategy and Portfolio Alignment

## Introduction

Sarah sat in the executive conference room, listening as the CIO outlined the organization's three-year strategic plan. Market pressures were mounting, customer expectations were evolving, and the company needed to transform digitally while maintaining operational excellence. As the presentation unfolded, Sarah saw a familiar pattern: ambitious strategic goals, limited resources, and more project ideas than the organization could possibly execute.

"We need to be selective," the CIO emphasized. "Not every good idea deserves funding. We need projects that deliver strategic value, not just operational improvements."

This was Sarah's introduction to portfolio management—the discipline of selecting, prioritizing, and governing projects to maximize organizational value. Over the following months, she would learn that great project management isn't just about executing work efficiently; it's about ensuring that the right work gets done in the first place.

Her three current projects—the office renovation, the expense system, and the broader transformation program—had all been selected through different lenses. The renovation supported operational efficiency and employee satisfaction. The expense system aligned with digital transformation goals. The transformation program directly addressed strategic imperatives around agility and customer focus.

But how had these projects been chosen? What made them more strategically valuable than the dozens of other ideas competing for resources? And how would their success ultimately contribute to organizational strategy?

This chapter explores the critical connection between organizational strategy and project work. You'll learn how projects are selected, how portfolios are managed, how programs coordinate related initiatives, and how organizations ensure that project investments deliver strategic value. This isn't abstract theory—it's the foundation of how successful organizations align execution with strategy.

## Integration: Strategy as the Foundation

Throughout this study guide, we've emphasized that effective project management requires understanding context. Nowhere is this more critical than in strategic alignment.

**From Chapter 8.2 (Value Delivery and Outcomes)**: We learned that projects exist to deliver value, not just outputs. This section builds on this by showing how organizational strategy defines what "value" means and how it's measured.

**From Chapter 1.3 (Ways of Working and Tailoring)**: Different delivery approaches require different strategic planning approaches. Predictive projects align through detailed upfront planning; agile projects align through ongoing prioritization and adaptation; hybrid approaches balance both.

**From Chapter 5.1 (Starting the Project)**: The business case and project charter (Chapter 5) are the mechanisms that connect individual projects to organizational strategy. This section provides the strategic context that makes those documents meaningful.

**From Chapter 6.1 (Planning for Value Delivery)**: Requirements and scope (Chapter 6) should trace back to strategic objectives. This section shows how to maintain that traceability at the portfolio and program level.

Strategic alignment isn't a one-time activity during project initiation. It's an ongoing discipline that requires:

- **Continuous validation** that projects remain strategically relevant as organizational priorities evolve
- **Portfolio-level governance** that balances competing initiatives and resource constraints
- **Benefits realization management** that tracks whether strategic outcomes are being achieved
- **Adaptive roadmapping** that responds to market changes while maintaining strategic direction

This chapter explores these themes through Sarah's experiences navigating the intersection of strategy and execution. Her journey illustrates a fundamental truth: the best-executed project delivers no value if it's aligned to the wrong strategy—or no strategy at all.

## ECO Alignment

This chapter addresses the following tasks from the PMP Certification Exam Content Outline (ECO):

| Domain | Task | Coverage |
|--------|------|----------|
| Business Environment | Task 1: Plan and Manage Project Compliance | Primary |
| Business Environment | Task 3: Evaluate and Address External Business Environment Changes | Primary |
| Business Environment | Task 8: Monitor and Respond to External Environment | Primary |

**How This Chapter Covers the ECO Tasks:**

**Business Environment Task 1** (Plan and Manage Project Compliance) requires you to:
- Select projects that align with organizational strategy and governance requirements
- Ensure portfolio decisions comply with organizational policies and strategic constraints
- Establish governance structures that guide project selection and prioritization
- Make decisions within defined organizational frameworks and authority levels
- Align project investments with organizational strategic objectives

**Business Environment Task 3** (Evaluate and Address External Business Environment Changes) requires you to:
- Recognize how market conditions, competitive pressures, and environmental factors affect strategic priorities
