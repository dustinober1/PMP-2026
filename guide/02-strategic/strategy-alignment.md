# 2.1 Strategic Alignment

**ECO Task**: Assess project alignment with organizational strategy

Strategic alignment is the discipline of ensuring that the **right work** gets done in the first place and stays relevant as the business environment shifts.

---

##  What Strategic Alignment Means (On the PMP Exam)
On the exam, “strategic alignment” is not a slogan. It is a **decision filter** you use every time you:

- Approve, reject, or re-prioritize work
- Recommend a scope change (or *refuse* one)
- Escalate a major risk or regulatory change
- Recommend a project be paused or closed because the expected value is gone

::: tip  The PMI Mindset
If a project is “green” (on time/budget) but is no longer valuable or compliant, it is **not successful**. The right answer is usually: **raise it to governance and recommend a strategic decision**.

##  The Alignment Toolkit (Artifacts You Must Recognize)
These artifacts show up in exam questions as clues for *where you are* in the lifecycle and *who decides what*.

| Artifact | What it answers | Owned by (primary) | Used when |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Business Case** | “Should we invest, and why?” | Sponsor / Business | Selection & funding decisions |
| **Project Charter** | “Are we authorized to start?” | Sponsor (authorizes) / PM (uses) | Initiating; formal start |
| **Benefits Realization Plan** | “How will value be measured and sustained?” | Benefits Owner / Business | Planning through sustainment |
| **Roadmap** (Product/Program) | “What outcomes come when?” | Product Owner / Program | Coordinating delivery & dependencies |
| **KPIs / OKRs** | “How do we know we are winning?” | Business leadership | Ongoing value validation |
| **Governance Reviews** | “Continue, pivot, pause, or stop?” | Steering committee / Portfolio | Stage gates / periodic reviews |
