# 2.1a Organizational Strategy & Project Selection

"Why are we doing this project?" It's a simple question that every project leader must be able to answer. Organizations typically have more ideas than resources, making **Project Selection** a critical strategic filter.

## 🏗️ Strategic Planning Frameworks
Organizations use multiple lenses to develop strategy and identify project needs.

### 1. SWOT Analysis
Assessing **Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats**.
- **Strengths/Weaknesses**: Internal factors (e.g., proprietary tech vs. outdated infrastructure).
- **Opportunities/Threats**: External factors (e.g., new market trends vs. regulatory changes).

### 2. Balanced Scorecard
Measuring performance across four critical perspectives:
- 💰 **Financial**: Revenue, ROI, cost management.
- 👥 **Customer**: Satisfaction, retention, market share.
- ⚙️ **Internal Processes**: Efficiency, innovation, quality.
- 🌱 **Learning & Growth**: Employee skills, culture, technology.

### 3. OKRs (Objectives and Key Results)
- **Objectives**: Qualitative goals (e.g., "Become the industry's digital leader").
- **Key Results**: Quantitative measures (e.g., "90% of user processes automated").

## 🚦 The Selection Filter
Project selection isn't just about financial return; it's about strategic fit.

### Selection Criteria
| Criterion               | Focus Area                                                   |
| :---------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Strategic Alignment** | Does this directly support our top 3 objectives?             |
| **Financial Return**    | What is the ROI, Net Present Value (NPV), or Payback Period? |
| **Compliance**          | Is this required by law or regulation?                       |
| **Feasibility**         | Do we have the technical capability and resources?           |
| **Risk**                | What is the probability and impact of failure?               |

::: info 💡 Pro Tip: Strategic Categories
- **Strategic Projects**: Transform capabilities or create new value (High risk, High visibility).
- **Operational Projects**: Improve efficiency or maintain existing systems (Lower risk, proven methods).
- **Compliance Projects**: Non-discretionary work required by law (Fixed deadlines, zero tolerance for delays).

## 🔄 Alignment Across Methodologies

- **Predictive (Waterfall)**: Strategy is translated into detailed requirements upfront. The business case "locks in" the strategic rationale before work begins.
- **Agile**: Strategy guides the **Product Vision** and **Roadmap**. Backlog prioritization ensures the team is always working on the highest-value strategic features *right now*.
- **Hybrid**: Strategic milestones are set at the program level, while teams use agile delivery to discover the best path to reach them.

  <strong>📝 Exam Insight:</strong> If a scenario describes a project that no longer aligns with a shifting organizational strategy, the project manager should typically facilitate a review with the sponsor or steering committee. The "best" action isn't always to finish the project; it's to protect organizational value.
