# 2.5 Program Management

**ECO Task**: Demonstrate an understanding of how projects fit within programs and portfolios

While the PMP exam focus is on individual projects, modern work increasingly happens within **Programs**. A program is a group of related projects managed in a coordinated way to obtain benefits not available from managing them individually.

##  The Program Manager's Perspective
If a Project Manager asks "Are we building it right?", the Program Manager asks "Are we building the right **set** of things to achieve our overarching strategic goal?"

| Aspect        | Project Management                      | Program Management                        |
| :------------ | :-------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------- |
| **Duration**  | Short-term; specific goal & end date    | Long-term; spans multiple lifecycles      |
| **Success**   | Deliverable quality & Triple Constraint | **Benefit Realization** & Strategic ROI   |
| **Change**    | PMs control change to protect baseline  | Program Managers expect & embrace change  |
| **Resources** | Managing the immediate project team     | Resolving conflicts between project teams |

##  Program Artifacts (What Shows Up in Exam Scenarios)
| Artifact | Purpose | Typical owner |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Program charter** | Authorizes the program and defines intended benefits | Sponsor / Program steering |
| **Program roadmap** | Sequencing, outcomes, and major milestones | Program manager |
| **Benefits register** | Lists benefits, measures, owners, timelines | Program manager + benefits owners |
| **Program risk register** | Cross-project risks and systemic risks | Program manager |
| **Dependency log** | Cross-project blockers and interface points | Program manager + project managers |

---

##  The Program Roadmap
A **Program Roadmap** is a high-level visual timeline of the program's components. In 2026, these are increasingly **Adaptive Roadmaps**:

- **Interdependencies**: Mapping risks where Project A must finish for Project B to start.
- **Strategic Milestones**: Focusing on outcomes (e.g., "Full Digital Migration") rather than technical tasks.
- **Rolling Wave Focus**: Detailing the near-term (3 months) while maintaining flexibility for the long-term themes.

::: tip Exam Insight
The Program Manager's job is to manage the space *between* the projects. If you're a PM in a program, your goal is to optimize your project while keeping an eye on how you might be blocking another PM's progress.
