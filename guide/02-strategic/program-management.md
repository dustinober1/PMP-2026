# 2.5 Program Management

While the PMP exam focuses on individual projects, you must understand **Program Management** because projects often exist within these larger structures. As covered in [Section 2.1c](./project-alignment), programs coordinate related projects to achieve benefits that wouldn't be possible in isolation.

## 🏗️ The Program Manager's Perspective
If a Project Manager asks "Are we building it right?", the Program Manager asks "Are we building the right set of things to achieve our strategic goal?"

| Aspect        | Project Management                         | Program Management                                  |
| :------------ | :----------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------- |
| **Duration**  | Short-term; specific end date.             | Long-term; spans multiple lifecycles.               |
| **Success**   | Deliverable quality and triple constraint. | **Benefit Realization** and ROI.                    |
| **Change**    | PMs try to minimize or control change.     | Program Managers expect and embrace change.         |
| **Resources** | Managing the immediate team.               | Resolving conflicts between multiple project teams. |

## 🗺️ The Program Roadmap
A **Program Roadmap** is a high-level visual timeline of the program's components.
- It shows **interdependencies** (Project A must finish before Project B can start).
- It highlights **Strategic Milestones** (e.g., "Market Launch" or "Regulatory Compliance").
- It is **Outcome-focused**, not task-focused.

## 🏛️ Program Governance
Programs have their own layer of governance, often a **Program Steering Committee**. This body:
1. **Resolves Conflicts**: If two Project Managers both need the same Lead Architect, the Program Steering Committee makes the final call based on strategic priority.
2. **Reallocates Budget**: Moving funds from a project that is under-performing to one that is high-priority.
3. **Approves Scope Shifts**: If one project discovers a new feature is needed for the program to succeed, the Program level handles the strategic approval.

## ⚡ Being a Project Manager in a Program
When you report to a Program Manager:
- **Think Globally**: Understand that your project might be asked to wait or pivot to help a sister project succeed.
- **Manage Interfaces**: You must spend more time coordinating with other Project Managers.
- **Escalate Interdependencies**: If another project is late and it hits your timeline, flag it to the Program Manager immediately.

::: tip 💡 2026 Focus: Adaptive Roadmaps
Traditional roadmaps were fixed years in advance. **2026 Adaptive Roadmaps** use a "Rolling Wave" approach: the next 3 months are detailed, but the next 3 years are flexible themes that change based on market feedback and AI insights.
