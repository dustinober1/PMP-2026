# 2.5 – Program Management

## 2.5.1 Introduction

While the PMP exam focuses on project management, understanding program management is essential because:

- Many projects exist within programs
- Program context shapes project decisions
- Benefits realization often occurs at the program level
- Career progression often leads to program roles

This section provides foundational understanding of program management concepts relevant to project managers.

## 2.5.2 Programs vs. Projects

### Key Distinctions

| Aspect             | Project                           | Program                    |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Focus**          | Deliverables (outputs)            | Benefits (outcomes)        |
| **Duration**       | Temporary, defined end            | Longer, may be ongoing     |
| **Scope**          | Fixed or progressively elaborated | Evolving based on benefits |
| **Success Metric** | On time, on budget, on scope      | Benefits realized          |
| **Change**         | Controlled, minimized             | Expected, embraced         |
| **Uncertainty**    | Managed, reduced                  | Inherent, navigated        |

### When to Use a Program

Programs are appropriate when:
- Multiple related projects share common goals
- Benefits emerge from coordinating projects, not individual delivery
- Strategic objectives require sustained, adaptive effort
- Resource sharing across projects creates efficiency
- Risk must be managed across interdependent initiatives

## 2.5.3 Program Management Performance Domains

PMI's Standard for Program Management identifies five performance domains:

### 1. Strategy Alignment

Ensuring the program supports organizational strategy:

- Connecting program objectives to strategic goals
- Adjusting program direction as strategy evolves
- Measuring contribution to strategic outcomes
- Communicating strategic value to stakeholders

### 2. Benefits Management

The primary reason programs exist:

- **Identification**: What benefits will the program deliver?
- **Analysis**: How will benefits be measured and valued?
- **Planning**: What must happen to realize benefits?
- **Delivery**: Are component projects enabling benefits?
- **Transition**: How will benefits transfer to operations?
- **Sustainment**: How will benefits be maintained long-term?

### 3. Stakeholder Engagement

Managing complex stakeholder relationships:

- Broader stakeholder landscape than single projects
- Conflicting interests across component projects
- Strategic-level stakeholders (executives, boards)
- Communication across multiple audiences
- Building and maintaining stakeholder commitment

### 4. Governance

Oversight and decision-making:

- **Program Steering Committee**: Strategic direction, major decisions
- **Program Management Office**: Coordination, standards, reporting
- **Decision Rights**: Authority boundaries at program, project levels
- **Change Control**: Managing scope, cost, and schedule changes
- **Risk Management**: Program-level risk identification and response

### 5. Life Cycle Management

Managing the program through phases:

| Phase                  | Focus                                                  |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Program Definition** | Charter, roadmap, governance setup                     |
| **Program Delivery**   | Execute projects, realize benefits, adapt              |
| **Program Closure**    | Transition benefits, close components, lessons learned |

### Key Responsibilities

| Area             | Responsibilities                                             |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Strategic**    | Align program to strategy, define benefits, manage roadmap   |
| **Governance**   | Establish oversight, manage decisions, ensure compliance     |
| **Stakeholder**  | Engage executives, manage cross-project relationships        |
| **Coordination** | Manage interdependencies, resolve conflicts, share resources |
| **Benefits**     | Track realization, adjust approach, report outcomes          |

### Program Manager vs. Project Manager

| Program Manager      | Project Manager      |
| -------------------- | -------------------- |
| Manages benefits     | Manages deliverables |
| Strategic focus      | Tactical focus       |
| Multiple projects    | Single project       |
| Longer horizon       | Defined timeline     |
| Ambiguity tolerance  | Clarity seeking      |
| Political navigation | Team leadership      |

## 2.5.5 Projects Within Programs

### How Program Context Affects Projects

When your project is part of a program:

| Area           | Impact                                       |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Scope**      | May be adjusted to serve program benefits    |
| **Schedule**   | Dependencies with other program projects     |
| **Resources**  | Shared resources across program              |
| **Risks**      | Cross-project risks managed at program level |
| **Changes**    | May require program-level approval           |
| **Reporting**  | Roll-up to program dashboards                |
| **Governance** | Multiple layers of oversight                 |

### Working with Program Managers

As a project manager in a program:

1. **Understand the bigger picture**: Know how your project contributes to program benefits
2. **Manage interdependencies**: Collaborate with other project managers
3. **Escalate appropriately**: Program-level issues go to the program manager
4. **Align communication**: Consistent messaging with program communications
5. **Participate in governance**: Engage in program ceremonies and reviews

## 2.5.6 Program Roadmaps

### What Is a Program Roadmap?

A program roadmap is a high-level timeline showing:
- Major program milestones and phases
- Component project timelines and interdependencies
- Benefit realization points
- Key decision gates
- Resource capacity and allocation periods

### Roadmap Characteristics

| Traditional Roadmap        | Agile/Adaptive Roadmap                              |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Fixed dates and milestones | Rolling wave with firm near-term, flexible far-term |
| Detailed project schedules | Themes and objectives by horizon                    |
| Change-controlled          | Regularly updated based on learning                 |
| Output-focused             | Outcome-focused                                     |

## 2.5.7 Key Takeaways

1. **Programs deliver benefits, projects deliver outputs**: Different focus, different success measures
2. **Five performance domains**: Strategy, Benefits, Stakeholders, Governance, Life Cycle
3. **Program context shapes projects**: Scope, schedule, and resources affected by program
4. **Benefits are the bottom line**: Everything in program management supports benefit realization
5. **Collaboration is essential**: Project managers must work together and with program managers

## 2.5.8 Exam Relevance

For the PMP exam, understand:

- The difference between projects, programs, and portfolios
- How projects fit within programs
- How benefits are managed at the program level
- When to escalate to program-level governance
