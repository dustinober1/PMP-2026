# 2.1d Benefits Realization & Value Creation

**ECO Task**: Evaluate and deliver project benefits and value

Delivering a project on time and under budget is a failure if it doesn't create value. This section explores how to ensure project **Outputs** lead to organizational **Benefits**.

## 💎 The Value Chain
Understand clearly the difference between what you build and the value it creates:

| Stage       | Definition                        | Example (Expense System)             |
| :---------- | :-------------------------------- | :----------------------------------- |
| **Output**  | Tangible project deliverable.     | Automated software deployed.         |
| **Outcome** | Change in capability or behavior. | Employees stop using spreadsheets.   |
| **Benefit** | **Measurable strategic value.**   | $250k annual administrative savings. |

## 📄 The Benefits Realization Plan (What “Good” Looks Like)
On the exam, benefits are not “hopeful outcomes.” They are **planned, measured, and owned**.

A strong benefits realization plan typically defines:
- **Benefit statement** (what changes, for whom, and why it matters)
- **Metric/KPI** and **baseline** (where we start)
- **Target** and **timeframe** (what “success” means and when)
- **Benefits owner** (accountable business role)
- **Measurement method and frequency** (how often and how)
- **Assumptions and risks** (what must be true)
- **Sustainment actions** (training, support model, process changes)

### Example KPI Definition
| KPI | Baseline | Target | Owner | Measure |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Expense approval cycle time | 10 days | 6 days within 90 days of rollout | Finance Ops Lead | System timestamps |

## 🔄 The Benefits Lifecycle
Benefits realization isn't a single event; it's a process that continues long after the project team disbands.

1. **Identification**: Defining expected benefits in the Business Case.
2. **Planning**: Creating a **Benefits Realization Plan** with metrics and owners.
3. **Execution**: Building features that specifically enable the promised benefits.
4. **Transition**: Handing over the system to a "Business Owner" who will realize the long-term value.
5. **Sustainment**: Ensuring benefits don't erode over time (e.g., through ongoing training).

::: info 🚦 Who Owns Benefits?
- **Project Manager**: Owns the delivery of the **Output**.
- **Business Owner / Sponsor**: Owns the realization of the **Benefit**.
- *Example*: The PM builds the gym (Output), but the Sponsor is responsible for the users getting fit (Benefit).

## 📈 Leading vs. Lagging Indicators (Exam Favorite)
- **Leading indicators** show early movement (training completion, adoption rate, usage).
- **Lagging indicators** confirm final value (cost savings, revenue, NPS lift).

If benefits are not appearing, PMI expects you to look first at **adoption and process change** (often a leading indicator problem), not just “more features.”

## 📊 Measuring Success
Value can be financial or non-financial.

### Financial Metrics
- **ROI (Return on Investment)**: (Benefits - Costs) / Costs.
- **NPV (Net Present Value)**: The value of future cash flows in today's dollars.
- **Payback Period**: How long it takes for the project to "pay for itself."

### Non-Financial Metrics
- **Customer Satisfaction (NPS)**.
- **Employee Engagement**.
- **Risk Mitigation** (e.g., preventing a security breach).
- **Sustainability (ESG)**: Meeting environmental or social goals.

## 🤖 AI and Value Creation
In the 2026 exam, AI is often a tool for value creation.
- **Output**: An AI-powered anomaly detection model.
- **Outcome**: Fraudulent expenses are flagged automatically.
- **Benefit**: 15% reduction in financial leakage and improved audit compliance.

<div class="study-tip">
  <strong>📝 Exam Insight:</strong> If a project is finished but the expected benefits haven't appeared after six months, the PM should recommend a <strong>Post-Implementation Review</strong> to identify adoption barriers (e.g., "employees weren't trained properly") rather than just declaring the project a success because the code was delivered.
