# 2.2 Benefits, Value, and Sustainability

Value is the net result of realized benefits minus the costs required to achieve them. In 2026, value includes ethical and sustainable dimensions, not just profit.

## 💎 The Value Equation
Traditional PM focused on Scope, Time, and Cost. The modern PM focuses on the **Triple Bottom Line**:

<div class="value-grid">
  <div class="value-card profit">
    <div class="value-title">Profit</div>
    <p>Does the project make financial sense? (ROI, NPV, Cost Savings).</p>
  </div>
  <div class="value-card people">
    <div class="value-title">People</div>
    <p>Does it improve lives for the community and employees? (Social Impact).</p>
  </div>
  <div class="value-card planet">
    <div class="value-title">Planet</div>
    <p>Is it environmentally sustainable? (Carbon footprint, Waste reduction).</p>
  </div>
</div>

## 🔄 Benefits Realization
Value isn't usually realized until *after* the project ends. BRM bridges that gap.

1.  **Identify**: Define the metric upfront (e.g., "Reduce processing time by 20%").
2.  **Execute**: Focus the team on features that drive that metric.
3.  **Sustain**: Hand over the "Benefits Plan" to operations so they can track it long-term.

::: tip 💡 The Benefits Owner
A critical role. This is the business person (not the PM) who is responsible for ensuring the deliverables actually generate revenue/savings after the project closes.

## 🌱 ESG: Integration, Not Add-on
In 2026, ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) is a **constraint**.

*   **Environmental**: Choosing a "Green" cloud provider or reducing material waste.
*   **Social**: Ensuring fair wages in the supply chain.
*   **Governance**: Strict adherence to anti-corruption laws.

<div class="study-tip">
  <strong>📝 Exam Insight:</strong> If a stakeholder suggests a cheaper vendor who has a history of human rights violations, the PM must **reject** the vendor based on the organization's ESG/Code of Ethics policy. Profit does not trump ethics on the PMP exam.
