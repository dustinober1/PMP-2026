# 2.2 Benefits, Value, and Sustainability

Projects exist to create value, not just to deliver outputs. In the 2026 PMP exam, your role shifts from being a "task driver" to a "value engine."

## 💎 The Value Mindset
Value is the net result of realized benefits minus the costs required to achieve them.

::: info 📊 2026 Shift: Beyond the Triple Constraint
Traditional PM focused on **Scope, Time, and Cost**. The modern PM focuses on **Strategic Alignment, Benefit Realization, and Sustainability**. Delivering a "perfect" project that no one uses is a failure.
:::

## 🔄 Benefits Realization (BRM)
As covered in [Section 2.1d](./benefits-realization), BRM is the process of ensuring that project outputs lead to actual organizational outcomes.

### The Benefits Register
A critical document that tracks:
- **Owner**: Who in the business is responsible for using the output?
- **Metric**: How will we prove value? (e.g., "15% reduction in churn").
- **Baseline**: Where are we starting from today?
- **Target**: What is the goal post-implementation?

## 🌱 Sustainability & ESG
One of the most significant updates for 2026 is the integration of **ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance)** factors into project decision-making.

## ⚖️ Balancing Short-Term vs. Long-Term Value
Projects often face a conflict between **fast delivery** and **sustainable value**. 

- **Technical Debt**: Cutting corners today to meet a deadline, which creates higher costs tomorrow.
- **Sustainability Trade-offs**: Choosing a cheaper, high-emission material vs. an expensive, green one.

**Your Role as PM**: 
1. Surface these trade-offs to the steering committee.
2. Quantify the long-term impact of short-term "hacks."
3. Defend the strategic value of the project over simple "completion."

  <strong>📝 Exam Insight:</strong> If an exam question asks you to choose between two vendors—one who is 10% cheaper but has a poor human rights record, and one who is slightly more expensive but follows ESG standards—PMI's 2026 "Business Environment" stance typically favors the <strong>ethical and sustainable</strong> choice.
