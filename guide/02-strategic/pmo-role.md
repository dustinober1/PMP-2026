## 🏛️ PMO Types
PMI categorizes PMOs based on their level of control and influence:

1. **Supportive PMO**: Provides templates, best practices, and training. Low control; mostly a "consultant" to project teams.
2. **Controlling PMO**: Requires compliance with specific frameworks and tools. Moderate control.
3. **Directive PMO**: Manages the projects directly. The project managers report to the PMO. High control.

## 💎 The Modern PMO (Value-Driven)
In the 2026 PMP exam, the PMO is no longer just a "reporting center." A modern PMO focuses on **Value Delivery**:

- **Strategic Alignment**: Ensuring every project in the portfolio supports a current business objective.
- **Benefits Tracking**: Monitoring whether projects are actually delivering the value promised in their business cases.
- **Capability Building**: Upskilling the workforce in AI, Agile, and hybrid methodologies.
- **Change Management**: Coordinating the "human side" of multiple projects so employees aren't overwhelmed by too much change at once.

A mature PMO provides several high-value services:
- **Methodology (Tailoring)**: Helping teams decide whether to use Scrum, Predictive, or Hybrid.
- **Resource Management**: Solving cross-project conflicts for specialist roles.
- **Knowledge Management**: Capturing "lessons learned" from finished projects to prevent future mistakes.
- **Tooling**: Providing AI assistants or project management software.

::: tip 💡 Pro Tip: PMO as a Servant Leader
