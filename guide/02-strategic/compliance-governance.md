# 2.3 Compliance & Governance

Projects operate within a web of external laws and internal rules. In the 2026 PMP exam, **Compliance** is a major task in the Business Environment domain, requiring you to proactively manage non-negotiable constraints.

## ⚖️ Regulatory Compliance
Compliance is the adherence to laws, regulations, and standards. Non-compliance is not just a project risk; it is a business threat that can lead to fines, lawsuits, or project cancellation.

## 🏛️ Project Governance
Governance is the framework of **authority and accountability**. It answers the question: "Who has the right to make which decisions?"

### Governance vs. Management
- **Governance (Steering Committee/Board)**: Sets the "North Star," defines guardrails, and approves major budget shifts.
- **Management (The PM & Team)**: Drives the project toward the goal within the established guardrails.

### The Governance Hierarchy
- **Portfolio Board**: High-level strategic oversight across all initiatives.
- **Steering Committee**: Executive support and decision-making for a specific project.
- **Project Governance Office (PMO)**: Standards, templates, and reporting consistency.

## 🧩 Ethical Decision-Making
PMI expects you to uphold four core values: **Responsibility, Respect, Fairness, and Honesty**.

| Step            | Action                                                                 |
| :-------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Identify** | Is this a conflict of interest or unethical practice?                  |
| **2. Consult**  | Refer to the **PMI Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct**.          |
| **3. Disclose** | Transparently report the situation to the appropriate authority.       |
| **4. Respond**  | Take the action that upholds integrity, even if it delays the project. |

<div class="study-tip">
  <strong>📝 Exam Insight:</strong> If an exam scenario asks what to do if a new regulation is announced mid-project, the answer is almost always to <strong>perform an impact assessment</strong> first. You cannot ignore it, and you shouldn't change the scope without knowing the cost/schedule impact.
