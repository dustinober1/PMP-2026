# 2.3 Compliance and Governance

Projects operate within a web of external laws and internal rules. In the 2026 PMP exam, **Compliance** is a major task in the Business Environment domain, requiring you to proactively manage non-negotiable constraints.

## ⚖️ Regulatory Compliance
Compliance is the adherence to laws, regulations, and standards. Non-compliance is not just a project risk; it is a business threat that can lead to fines, lawsuits, or project cancellation.

### Common Compliance Domains
| Domain            | Focus                                         |
| :---------------- | :-------------------------------------------- |
| **Data Privacy**  | GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA (Protecting personal info). |
| **Environmental** | EPA, LEED, Carbon mandates (Sustainability).  |
| **Financial**     | Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX), Anti-money laundering.  |
| **Safety**        | OSHA, Building codes, Worker protection.      |

::: warning 📊 2026 Exam Alert: Data Privacy
With the rise of AI, data privacy is a frequent exam topic. If your project involves training a model on customer data, you **must** ensure the data is anonymized and compliant with privacy laws before proceeding.

## 🏛️ Project Governance
Governance is the framework of **authority and accountability**. It answers the question: "Who has the right to make which decisions?"

### Governance vs. Management
- **Governance (Board/Steering)**: Sets the "North Star," defines guardrails, and approves budgets.
- **Management (You)**: Drives the team toward the goal within those guardrails.

### The Governance Hierarchy
- **Portfolio Board**: Approves/Cancels projects based on strategy.
- **Steering Committee**: Resolves high-level issues for a specific project.
- **CCB (Change Control Board)**: Approves or rejects changes to the project baseline.

## 🧩 Ethical Decision-Making
PMI expects you to uphold four core values: **Responsibility, Respect, Fairness, and Honesty**.

### The Ethical Framework
When facing a dilemma (e.g., a vendor offers a "gift" during a bid):
1. **Identify**: Is this a conflict of interest?
2. **Evaluate** against the **PMI Code of Ethics**.
3. **Transparent Communication**: Report the situation to your supervisor or the legal department.
4. **Impartiality**: Ensure your decision is based on merit, not personal gain.

## 🔄 Governance Across Methodologies

- **Predictive**: Formal "GATES" at the end of each phase. You cannot proceed from Design to Build without a governance sign-off.
- **Agile**: Governance is embedded in ceremonies (Sprint reviews) and the Product Owner's role. It is decentralized and frequent.
- **Hybrid**: Often uses predictive governance for budget and milestones, but agile governance for feature delivery.

  <strong>📝 Exam Insight:</strong> If an exam scenario asks what to do if a new regulation is announced, the answer is almost always to <strong>perform an impact assessment</strong> first. You cannot ignore it, and you shouldn't panic-change the scope without knowing the cost/schedule impact.
