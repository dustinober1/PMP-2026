# 2.3 – Compliance, Risk, and Governance

## 2.3.1 Introduction

Projects operate within a web of legal, regulatory, and organizational constraints. Understanding and managing these constraints is essential for project success and professional responsibility.

This section covers:
- Regulatory and legal compliance obligations
- Data privacy and security requirements
- Organizational governance frameworks
- Ethical decision-making in project management

## 2.3.2 Regulatory Compliance

### What Is Regulatory Compliance?

Regulatory compliance means adhering to laws, regulations, and standards that apply to your project. Non-compliance can result in:

- Legal penalties and fines
- Project delays or cancellation
- Reputational damage
- Personal liability

### Common Regulatory Domains

| Domain                | Examples             | Impact on Projects               |
| --------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Data Privacy**      | GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA    | Data handling, consent, storage  |
| **Financial**         | SOX, Basel III       | Audit trails, financial controls |
| **Safety**            | OSHA, building codes | Construction, manufacturing      |
| **Environmental**     | EPA, ISO 14001       | Emissions, waste, resources      |
| **Industry-Specific** | FDA, FAA, PCI-DSS    | Pharma, aviation, payments       |

### Managing Compliance in Projects

1. **Identify** applicable regulations early in the project
2. **Assess** compliance requirements and constraints
3. **Plan** for compliance activities in scope and schedule
4. **Monitor** compliance throughout execution
5. **Document** evidence of compliance for audits
6. **Report** compliance status to governance bodies

::: warning Exam Alert
Compliance is not optional. On the exam, answers that bypass compliance requirements—even for efficiency—are typically incorrect.

## 2.3.3 Data Privacy and Security

### Key Privacy Principles

Modern data privacy regulations share common principles:

| Principle              | Description                             |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Lawfulness**         | Data processing must have a legal basis |
| **Purpose Limitation** | Data used only for stated purposes      |
| **Data Minimization**  | Collect only necessary data             |
| **Accuracy**           | Keep data correct and up-to-date        |
| **Storage Limitation** | Don't keep data longer than needed      |
| **Security**           | Protect data from unauthorized access   |
| **Accountability**     | Demonstrate compliance                  |

### Privacy in Project Management

As a project manager, consider:

- **Requirements**: What data will the project collect, process, or store?
- **Consent**: How will consent be obtained and documented?
- **Access**: Who will have access to sensitive data?
- **Protection**: What security controls are needed?
- **Retention**: How long will data be kept? How will it be disposed?
- **Breach Response**: What happens if data is compromised?

## 2.3.4 Project Governance

### What Is Project Governance?

Project governance is the framework of authority, accountability, and decision-making that guides project execution. It includes:

- **Roles and Responsibilities**: Who decides what
- **Escalation Paths**: How issues are raised and resolved
- **Reporting Requirements**: What information is shared, when, and to whom
- **Decision Rights**: Authority levels for various decisions
- **Compliance Requirements**: Standards that must be followed

### Governance Structures

| Level         | Body                       | Role                                             |
| ------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Portfolio** | Portfolio Review Board     | Strategic alignment, investment decisions        |
| **Program**   | Program Steering Committee | Benefits realization, cross-project coordination |
| **Project**   | Project Steering Committee | Project direction, major decisions               |
| **Execution** | Change Control Board       | Scope, schedule, budget changes                  |

### Governance vs. Management

| Governance                | Management               |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Sets direction            | Executes work            |
| Defines constraints       | Works within constraints |
| Makes strategic decisions | Makes tactical decisions |
| Holds accountability      | Takes responsibility     |
| Oversees performance      | Delivers performance     |

## 2.3.5 Ethical Decision-Making

### PMI Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct

PMI members and credential holders agree to uphold four values:

| Value              | Description                                |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Responsibility** | Take ownership of decisions and actions    |
| **Respect**        | Treat others with dignity and fairness     |
| **Fairness**       | Make decisions impartially and objectively |
| **Honesty**        | Communicate truthfully and transparently   |

### Ethical Dilemmas in Projects

Common ethical challenges include:

- **Conflicts of Interest**: Personal gain vs. project good
- **Pressure to Misreport**: Hiding problems or inflating progress
- **Resource Allocation**: Favoritism vs. merit-based decisions
- **Scope Creep**: Stakeholder requests vs. approved scope
- **Vendor Relationships**: Gifts, kickbacks, unfair practices

### Framework for Ethical Decisions

When facing an ethical dilemma:

1. **Identify** the ethical issue clearly
2. **Consider** all stakeholders affected
3. **Evaluate** options against PMI's Code of Ethics
4. **Consult** with trusted advisors or legal/compliance
5. **Decide** and document your reasoning
6. **Act** with transparency and integrity

::: tip Exam Strategy
On the exam, ethical answers typically:
- Prioritize transparency over convenience
- Consider all stakeholders, not just powerful ones
- Follow established processes rather than shortcuts
- Escalate concerns through proper channels
