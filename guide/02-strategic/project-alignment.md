# 2.1c Project and Program Alignment

Individual projects can fail in isolation if their interdependencies aren't managed. **Programs** provide the connective tissue that ensures 1 + 1 = 3.

---

## 🧭 What “Alignment” Looks Like Inside a Program
Program alignment is about keeping multiple projects moving toward the **same outcomes and benefits**.

Common alignment mechanisms:
- **Program roadmap** (sequencing + outcomes)
- **Benefits map / benefits register** (why each project exists)
- **Dependency log** (what is blocked by what)
- **Integrated change control at the program level** (so one project’s change does not break another)
- **Regular cross-project coordination** (syncs, demos, roadmap reviews)

## 🔗 The Synergy Engine
Why group projects into a Program?

## 🚦 Managing Dependencies
A dependency is where one project holds the key to another's success.

*   **Finish-to-Start**: The Platform Foundation (Project A) must be complete before the App (Project B) can launch.
*   **Resource Lock**: Both projects need the Lead Security Engineer in Week 40.
*   **External**: Project C is waiting for a government permit.

::: tip 💡 Integrated Roadmaps
Program Managers use **Integrated Master Schedules** to visualize these dependencies. If Project A slips by 2 weeks, the software automatically highlights the crash in Project B.

## 🧩 Dependency Types (And How They Fail)
| Dependency type | Example | Common failure mode | PMI-aligned response |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Finish-to-start** | API must exist before app integration | Upstream delay cascades | Re-plan, escalate, adjust milestones |
| **Resource** | Same architect needed in two projects | Hidden conflict / double-booking | Escalate through program governance |
| **External** | Permit, vendor delivery, regulator approval | Outside your control | Early engagement + risk response plans |
| **Technical interface** | Data format contracts | Teams make incompatible changes | Interface agreements + integration testing |

## 🔄 Delivery Contexts
How alignment works in different methodologies:

| Method             | Alignment Mechanism                                                                                                        |
| :----------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Agile (Scaled)** | **PI Planning** (Program Increment): All teams meet every 10 weeks to map dependencies on a physical board (String board). |
| **Predictive**     | **Master Schedule**: A rigid Gantt chart linking critical paths across projects.                                           |
| **Hybrid**         | **Guardrails**: Fixed milestones (Launch Date) with flexible execution (Sprints) inside.                                   |

  <strong>📝 Exam Insight:</strong> If you discover a dependency on another project that you do not control:
  1.  **Contact Peer PM**: Try to resolve it directly.
  2.  **Escalate to Program Manager**: If you cannot resolve it peer-to-peer.
