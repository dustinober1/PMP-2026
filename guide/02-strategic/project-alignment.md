# 2.1c Project and Program Alignment

Programs exist because complex strategic outcomes often require multiple related projects working in harmony. Individual projects can fail in isolation if their interdependencies aren't managed.

## 🔗 Why Programs Matter
Programs provide the **connective tissue** that ensures individual projects add up to collective value.

| Challenge              | Program Solution                                                                |
| :--------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Silos**              | Unified roadmap prevent duplication of effort.                                  |
| **Dependencies**       | Integrated scheduling ensures Project B doesn't wait for a delayed Project A.   |
| **Shared Resources**   | Prioritizing a single architect's time across four related projects.            |
| **Economies of Scale** | Shared procurement or technical infrastructure (e.g., a common Cloud platform). |

## 🚦 Managing Dependencies
A dependency is a relationship where one project's output is required for another project's success.

- **Finish-to-Start**: The Platform Foundation must be complete before the Expense System starts its integration.
- **Resource Dependency**: Both the Mobile App and the Web App need the same Lead Designer at the same time.
- **External Dependency**: A project is waiting on a regulatory approval before it can go live.

::: tip 💡 Pro Tip: Integrated Roadmaps
Without a program roadmap, projects plan independently, often missing critical hand-off dates. Program Managers use **Integrated Roadmaps** to visualize these dependencies across the entire collection of work.

## 🏛️ Governance & Reporting
Alignment is maintained through a **Program Steering Committee** that includes the executive sponsors of all component projects.

### Integrated Status Reporting
A program dashboard doesn't just show "on time/on budget" for each project; it highlights:
1. **Program Health**: Overall status toward the strategic goal.
2. **Critical Path**: Which project delay will derail the entire program?
3. **Benefits realization**: Progress toward the *outcome* (e.g., "30% cost reduction") rather than just the *output* (e.g., "software delivered").

## 🔄 Delivery Contexts

### Agile Programs (Scaled Agile)
Uses frameworks like **SAFe** or **LeSS**. Alignment is achieved through **PI Planning** (Program Increment Planning) where all teams meet every 8-12 weeks to visualize dependencies and commit to shared objectives.

### Predictive Programs
Uses a detailed, upfront **Master Schedule**. Alignment is maintained through strict change control and phase-gate reviews.

### Hybrid Programs
Milestones are fixed predictively (e.g., "Product Launch in Q4"), but teams use agile sprints to discover and build the features within those guardrails.

  <strong>📝 Exam Insight:</strong> On the exam, if a project manager discovers a dependency on another project that is outside their control, the first step is usually to <strong>communicate with the other project manager</strong> and then <strong>escalate to the Program Manager</strong> if a resolution can't be found.
