# Chapter 2: Strategy & Business Environment

Projects do not exist in a vacuum. A project manager's success in 2026 is measured by how well their work aligns with organizational strategy, complies with global governance, and delivers **sustainable value**.

::: info  2026 Domain Shift
The **Business Environment domain is 26% of the exam**, but it influences 100% of your decisions. A "perfect" project that fails to align with strategy is a failed project.

## 2026 Mindset: The "Business" PM
You are no longer just a technical executor. You are a **Business Leader**.
*   **Sustainability**: Every project must have an ESG component.
*   **Compliance**: You are the first line of defense for data privacy and regulatory adherence.
*   **Change**: You don't just build the tool; you ensure the organization is ready to *use* it.
*   **Value**: Your success is measured by benefits realized, not just outputs delivered.

::: tip  How to Study This Chapter
If you're short on time, focus on this sequence:
1. `strategy-selection` (how work gets chosen + financial formulas)
2. `portfolio-concepts` + `program-management` (how work gets coordinated)
3. `benefits-realization` + `benefits-value` (how success is measured)
4. `compliance-governance` + `external-environment` (how constraints and changes impact delivery)
5. `organizational-change` (how value actually gets adopted)
6. `knowledge-check` (test your understanding with 25 exam-style questions)
