## 🏆 Key Takeaways

| Concept        | The "PMI Way"                                            |
| :------------- | :------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Strategy**   | Driving selection and prioritization. "Align or Cancel." |
| **Benefits**   | Realized *after* the project. Owned by the Business.     |
| **Compliance** | Mandatory. A "Must-Have," not a "Nice-to-Have."          |
| **Change**     | Managed through "Why" (Desire) and "How" (Ability).      |
