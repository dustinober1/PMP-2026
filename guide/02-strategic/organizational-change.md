# 2.4 Organizational Change

"Technology projects don't fail because of technology—they fail because people don't adopt the change." This is the core principle of **Organizational Change Management (OCM)**.

## 👥 The Human Side of Projects
In the 2026 PMP exam, you aren't just responsible for the software; you are responsible for the **Adoption**.

| Output (Deliverable) | Outcome (Adoption)       | The OCM Gap                               |
| :------------------- | :----------------------- | :---------------------------------------- |
| A new CRM system.    | Sales reps use it daily. | Reps hate the UI and go back to Excel.    |
| An AI assistant.     | Coding speed increases.  | Devs fear for their jobs and sabotage it. |
| A new office.        | Higher collaboration.    | Commute is longer; employees quit.        |

## 🪜 Change Frameworks
You should be familiar with these three classic models for the exam:

### 1. ADKAR (Individual Change)
People change one at a time. They must move through:
- **A**wareness: "Why are we changing?"
- **D**esire: "What's in it for me (WIIFM)?"
- **K**nowledge: "How do I use the new tool?"
- **A**bility: "Can I do it under pressure?"
- **R**einforcement: "Is the new way being rewarded?"

### 2. Kotter’s 8 Steps (Organizational Change)
Focuses on building momentum:
1. Create Urgency.
2. Build a Guiding Coalition.
3. Form a Strategic Vision.
4. Enlist a Volunteer Army.
5. Enable Action (Remove barriers).
6. Generate Short-term Wins.
7. Sustain Acceleration.
8. Institute Change (Make it part of the culture).

### 3. Lewin’s Model
- **Unfreeze**: Breaking the status quo.
- **Change**: Moving to the new state.
- **Refreeze**: Making the new state permanent.

## 🛑 Managing Resistance
Resistance isn't "bad behavior"—it's a natural reaction to fear.

### Common Root Causes
- **Fear of Job Loss**: Especially relevant in AI projects.
- **Change Fatigue**: Too many projects launching at once.
- **Lack of Trust**: "Leaders never finish what they start."

### Your Strategy
- **Active Listening**: Don't dismiss concerns; hear them.
- **Transparency**: Communicate early and often, even if you don't have all the answers.
- **Involvement**: People support what they help create. Involve "resistors" in the testing or design phase.

::: tip 💡 2026 Insight: Change Saturation
As a PM, you must monitor **Change Saturation**. If the Finance team is already implementing three other projects, launching your new expense system now might lead to a 0% adoption rate. The correct strategic move might be to **delay your launch**.

  <strong>📝 Exam Insight:</strong> If an exam scenario says stakeholders are unhappy with a change, the best answer is usually to <strong>identify the root cause of their resistance</strong> or <strong>involve them in the process</strong>, rather than "training them more" or "escalating to their manager."
