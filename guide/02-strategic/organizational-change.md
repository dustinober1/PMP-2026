# 2.4 Organizational Change

**ECO Task**: Support organizational change

"Technology projects don't fail because of technology—they fail because people don't adopt the change." This is the core principle of **Organizational Change Management (OCM)**.

---

##  The PMP Mindset: Adoption Is Part of "Done"
If the project delivers the tool but nobody uses it, value is not realized. PMI expects you to plan for:
- **Readiness** (are people prepared?)
- **Adoption** (are people actually using it?)
- **Sustainment** (will the behavior stick?)

##  The Adoption Gap
The chasm between "Output" and "Outcome" is human adoption.

| The Deliverable (Output) | The Human Reality (Risk)                              | The OCM Solution                                         |
| :----------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------- |
| **New CRM System**       | Sales Reps stick to Excel because it's familiar.      | Early "Champion" program to build advocacy.              |
| **New AI Coding Tool**   | Developers fear job loss and sabotage implementation. | Transparent communication on job security + re-skilling. |
| **New Safety Protocol**  | Workers ignore it because it slows them down.         | "WIIFM" (What's in it for me) safety bonuses.            |
| **New Expense System**   | Employees find workarounds to avoid the new process.  | Management enforcement + process redesign.               |
| **New Collaboration Tool** | Teams continue using email and old tools.             | Executive role modeling + remove old tool access.        |

ADKAR is the most commonly tested change framework. Understanding each element helps you diagnose and address resistance.

  </div>
</div>

::: tip  ADKAR Diagnosis Shortcut
If training is excellent but adoption is still low, you usually have a **Desire** problem (motivation, fear, incentives), not a Knowledge problem. Training solves K and A, but it cannot solve D.

##  The Change Management Plan (What It Typically Contains)
In practice (and on the exam), change is supported by a set of coordinated plans:

### Change Management Plan Components

| Component | Purpose | Key Elements |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Change Impact Assessment** | Who is impacted and how | Stakeholder groups; impact severity; timing |
| **Stakeholder Engagement** | Messages, channels, cadence | Target audiences; key messages; communication schedule |
| **Training Plan** | Learning paths and support | Training formats; schedule; assessment; certification |
| **Champion Network** | Local advocates | Champion selection; training; responsibilities |
| **Resistance Management** | How feedback is captured and acted on | Escalation paths; intervention strategies |
| **Adoption Metrics** | How you measure readiness and usage | Leading/lagging indicators; targets; reporting |
| **Sustainment Plan** | Long-term support model | Ongoing training; help desk; process integration |

###  Example Adoption Metrics

| Metric | Type | Why It Matters | Example Target |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Training Completion** | Leading (Readiness) | Shows people are prepared | 95% complete before go-live |
| **Active Usage** | Lagging (Adoption) | Shows people are using the system | 80% weekly active users by week 4 |
| **Process Compliance** | Lagging (Behavior) | Shows process change | 90% of requests in new system |
| **Support Ticket Trend** | Lagging (Friction) | Shows ease of use | Tickets decrease by 50% after week 4 |
| **User Satisfaction (NPS)** | Lagging (Experience) | Shows acceptance | NPS > 20 by month 3 |
| **Error Rate** | Lagging (Quality) | Shows proper use | Errors < 5% by month 2 |

---

##  Managing Resistance
Resistance is a natural reaction to fear. Do not punish it; manage it.

### Understanding Resistance

<div class="resistance-types">
  <div class="resist-card">
    <div class="resist-type">Can't Do It</div>
    <div class="resist-adkar">Knowledge/Ability Gap</div>
    <p>Person lacks skills or resources to change</p>
    <div class="resist-solution">Solution: Training, coaching, tools, support</div>
  </div>
  
  <div class="resist-card">
    <div class="resist-type">Won't Do It</div>
    <div class="resist-adkar">Desire Gap</div>
    <p>Person doesn't want to change; fears or opposes</p>
    <div class="resist-solution">Solution: WIIFM, addressing fears, incentives, management reinforcement</div>
  </div>
  
  <div class="resist-card">
    <div class="resist-type">Don't Get It</div>
    <div class="resist-adkar">Awareness Gap</div>
    <p>Person doesn't understand why change is needed</p>
    <div class="resist-solution">Solution: Communication, leadership messaging, burning platform</div>
  </div>
</div>

###  WIIFM (What's In It For Me?)
Communicate the benefits to *them*, not just the company.

| Change | Company Benefit | WIIFM Message |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| New CRM | Better sales tracking | "You'll have customer history at your fingertips—no more hunting for info" |
| Expense System | Faster processing | "Get reimbursed in 3 days instead of 3 weeks" |
| AI Tool | Productivity gains | "AI handles the tedious parts so you can focus on creative work" |
| Safety Protocol | Fewer accidents | "Go home safely every day to your family" |

###  Change Saturation

*   **Saturation Check**: If the org is undergoing 5 changes simultaneously, adding a 6th will fail regardless of quality
*   The strategic move is to **Delay** or **Sequence** changes
*   Consider a "change portfolio" approach—prioritize and pace changes just like project portfolio management

---

##  Culture vs. Strategy
Peter Drucker famously said, *"Culture eats strategy for breakfast."*

*   **Culture**: The shared values and "unwritten rules" of the organization (e.g., "We value speed over perfection" or "We never deliver bad news upwards")
*   **Strategy**: The plan to achieve goals

### Cultural Compatibility Matrix

| Culture Type | Compatible Changes | Incompatible Changes | PM Approach |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Risk-Averse** | Incremental improvements; proven solutions | Bleeding-edge innovation; fail-fast | Emphasize testing; pilot programs |
| **Hierarchical** | Top-down mandates; clear roles | Self-organizing teams; empowerment | Executive sponsorship critical |
| **Innovative** | New technology; experimentation | Standardization; rigid processes | Frame as continuous improvement |
| **Collaborative** | Team-based decisions; consensus | Unilateral changes; top-down edicts | Involve stakeholders; co-create |

::: warning  Exam Insight
If your project strategy conflicts with the culture (e.g., trying to implement "Fail Fast" Agile in a culture that punishes all errors), the project will fail unless you address the culture first. You cannot install a tool that violates the culture.
:::

##  Agile Change Management
In predictive projects, change is often a "Big Bang" at the end. In Agile, change is **iterative**:

### Agile vs. Predictive Change Management

| Aspect | Predictive (Big Bang) | Agile (Iterative) |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Timing** | Change at the end | Continuous small changes |
| **User Involvement** | Requirements phase; UAT | Every sprint demo; continuous feedback |
| **Resistance Detection** | Late (at go-live) | Early (at each iteration) |
| **Adjustments** | Difficult; change control | Built-in; backlog reprioritization |
| **Training** | Single training event | Progressive learning; learning by doing |

### Agile Change Principles

*   **Continuous Feedback**: Users see the tool every 2 weeks, so resistance is caught early
*   **Co-Creation**: Stakeholders help build the solution, so "Desire" (from ADKAR) is built-in
*   **Minimal Viable Change**: Introduce small shifts incrementally rather than one massive shock
*   **Demo-Based Buy-In**: Showing working software builds confidence and reduces fear

##  Change Champion Networks

### What Champions Do

| Champion Activity | Purpose | Impact |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Advocate** | Promote the change locally | Builds grassroots support |
| **Translate** | Explain "corporate speak" in local terms | Increases understanding |
| **Listen** | Gather and report concerns | Early warning system for resistance |
| **Model** | Demonstrate new behaviors | Peer influence |
| **Support** | First line of help for colleagues | Reduces help desk load |

### Building an Effective Champion Network

1. **Select Champions**: Choose respected peers (not just managers)
2. **Train Early**: Champions need info before their colleagues
3. **Equip**: Provide talking points, FAQs, escalation paths
4. **Connect**: Build community; regular champion meetings
5. **Recognize**: Acknowledge champion contributions
