# 2.4 – Organizational Change and Readiness

## 2.4.1 Introduction

Every project introduces change. Whether it's a new system, process, structure, or way of working, success depends not just on delivering the project—but on ensuring people adopt and sustain the change.

Organizational Change Management (OCM) is the discipline of preparing, equipping, and supporting people to successfully adopt change and achieve desired outcomes.

::: tip Key Insight
**Technology projects don't fail because of technology**—they fail because people don't adopt the change. OCM addresses the human side of project success.

## 2.4.2 Why Change Management Matters

### The Adoption Challenge

Project success is measured by outcomes, not just outputs:

| Project Output       | Desired Outcome                 | Risk Without OCM                    |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| New CRM system       | Improved customer relationships | Staff revert to spreadsheets        |
| New process          | Faster cycle time               | Workarounds emerge                  |
| Office relocation    | Improved collaboration          | Productivity drops, attrition rises |
| Agile transformation | Increased responsiveness        | Teams resist, old habits persist    |

### Statistics on Change

Research consistently shows:
- ~70% of change initiatives fail to meet objectives
- Resistance is the #1 obstacle to successful change
- Projects with excellent OCM are 6x more likely to meet objectives

## 2.4.3 Change Readiness Assessment

Before introducing change, assess the organization's readiness:

### Readiness Factors

| Factor         | Questions to Ask                                      |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Capacity**   | Does the organization have bandwidth for this change? |
| **Capability** | Do people have skills to adopt the change?            |
| **Culture**    | Does the culture support or resist change?            |
| **History**    | What is the track record with past changes?           |
| **Leadership** | Is leadership committed and visible?                  |
| **Urgency**    | Do people understand why change is needed now?        |

### Readiness Assessment Matrix

Rate each factor to identify areas needing focus:

| Factor     | Low Risk             | Medium Risk        | High Risk          |
| ---------- | -------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| Capacity   | ✓ Slack exists       | → Some strain      | ✗ Overwhelmed      |
| Capability | ✓ Skills present     | → Training needed  | ✗ Major gaps       |
| Culture    | ✓ Change-friendly    | → Cautious         | ✗ Change-averse    |
| History    | ✓ Successful changes | → Mixed results    | ✗ Failed changes   |
| Leadership | ✓ Committed sponsors | → Inconsistent     | ✗ Absent/resistant |
| Urgency    | ✓ Burning platform   | → Moderate concern | ✗ Complacency      |

## 2.4.4 Change Management Frameworks

### ADKAR Model

The ADKAR model (Prosci) describes five stages individuals move through:

| Stage             | Description                        | PM Actions                             |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Awareness**     | Understanding why change is needed | Communicate the business case          |
| **Desire**        | Personal motivation to participate | Address WIIFM ("What's In It For Me?") |
| **Knowledge**     | How to change                      | Provide training and information       |
| **Ability**       | Skills and behaviors to implement  | Practice, coaching, support            |
| **Reinforcement** | Sustaining the change              | Recognition, accountability            |

### Kotter's 8 Steps

John Kotter's model outlines organizational change in phases:

**Creating Climate for Change**
1. Create urgency
2. Build guiding coalition
3. Form strategic vision

**Engaging and Enabling**
4. Enlist volunteer army
5. Enable action by removing barriers
6. Generate short-term wins

**Implementing and Sustaining**
7. Sustain acceleration
8. Institute change

### Lewin's Change Model

Kurt Lewin's simple three-stage model:

1. **Unfreeze**: Create motivation to change, challenge status quo
2. **Change**: Implement the new way of working
3. **Refreeze**: Stabilize and reinforce the new normal

## 2.4.5 Stakeholder Impact Analysis

### Identifying Who Is Affected

Map stakeholders by:
- **Type of impact** (process, role, skills, reporting, tools)
- **Degree of change** (minor adjustment → fundamental shift)
- **Current state** (supporter, neutral, resistor)
- **Influence** (power to help or hinder adoption)

### Impact Assessment Template

| Stakeholder Group | Current State       | Future State         | Impact Level | Support Level |
| ----------------- | ------------------- | -------------------- | ------------ | ------------- |
| Sales team        | Manual tracking     | CRM system           | High         | Neutral       |
| IT support        | Reactive tickets    | Self-service portal  | Medium       | Supportive    |
| Finance           | Spreadsheet reports | Automated dashboards | High         | Resistant     |

## 2.4.6 Managing Resistance

### Why People Resist Change

| Resistance Source           | Root Cause                    | Response Strategy             |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Fear of unknown**         | Uncertainty                   | Information, transparency     |
| **Loss of control**         | Change is imposed             | Involvement, participation    |
| **Comfort with status quo** | Current state works           | Create urgency, show benefits |
| **Lack of trust**           | Leadership credibility issues | Consistent actions, honesty   |
| **Bad timing**              | Change fatigue                | Pace changes, prioritize      |
| **Misalignment**            | Don't see personal benefit    | Address WIIFM                 |

### Resistance Response Strategies

1. **Listen actively**: Understand concerns before responding
2. **Acknowledge emotions**: Resistance often masks legitimate concerns
3. **Involve resistors**: People support what they help create
4. **Address root causes**: Surface-level responses don't work
5. **Provide support**: Training, coaching, resources
6. **Celebrate wins**: Build momentum with early successes

::: warning Exam Insight
Resistance is a natural part of change. On the exam, avoid answers that dismiss or override resistance—instead, look for answers that engage and address concerns.

## 2.4.7 Communication for Change

### Key Principles

- **Early and often**: Start communication before changes are implemented
- **Multi-channel**: Different people prefer different formats
- **Two-way**: Create opportunities for questions and feedback
- **Consistent**: Aligned messages from all leaders
- **Honest**: Acknowledge challenges and uncertainties

### Communication Plan Elements

| Element      | Description                                    |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Audience** | Who needs to know                              |
| **Message**  | What they need to understand                   |
| **Channel**  | How the message will be delivered              |
| **Timing**   | When to communicate                            |
| **Sender**   | Who delivers the message (credibility matters) |
| **Feedback** | How responses will be captured                 |

## 2.4.8 Sustaining Change

Change doesn't stick automatically. Plan for sustainment:

### Sustainment Strategies

- **Accountability**: Performance metrics tied to new behaviors
- **Reinforcement**: Recognition and rewards for adoption
- **Support**: Help desk, coaching, refresher training
- **Leadership modeling**: Leaders demonstrate the change
- **Process integration**: Embed changes into standard procedures
- **Monitoring**: Track adoption and address backsliding

---

## 2.4.9 Key Takeaways

1. **Projects deliver change**: Technical delivery alone isn't success—adoption is
2. **Assess readiness first**: Understand organizational capacity and culture
3. **Use proven frameworks**: ADKAR, Kotter, and Lewin provide structured approaches
4. **Resistance is information**: Listen to and address concerns, don't dismiss them
5. **Communication is critical**: Early, honest, two-way communication enables adoption
6. **Plan for sustainment**: Change requires ongoing reinforcement
