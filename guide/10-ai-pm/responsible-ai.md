# 10.2 Responsible AI: Ethics & Governance

Using AI is not just a technical choice; it is an **ethical** one. Project Managers are stewards of their organization's data and their team's culture.

## 🛡️ Data Privacy & Security
The #1 rule of AI in Project Management: **Protect the Data.**

- **Public vs. Private Models**: Never upload sensitive project data (financials, blueprints, PII) to a public, free AI tool. These tools often use your data to train their models.
- **Enterprise Guardrails**: Only use tools approved by your IT/Security department that offer "Enterprise Data Privacy."

---

## ⚖️ Bias and Fairness
AI models are trained on historical data. If that data is biased, the AI's recommendations will be biased.
- **Example**: If an AI predicts project success based on historical data from a male-dominated engineering firm, it might unfairly penalize projects led by different demographics.
- **The PM's Role**: Constantly audit AI outputs for **fairness** and ensure diverse perspectives are included in the validation process.

## 📜 AI Working Agreements
Just like you have a Team Charter, you should have an AI Working Agreement. This document defines:
1. **Approved Tools**: Which LLMs or analyzers are we allowed to use?
2. **Disclosure**: When must a team member admit they used AI to draft a document?
3. **Accountability**: Who is responsible if the AI makes an error? (Answer: The Human author).

---

## 🏛️ Governance & Compliance
AI projects must still follow organizational governance.
- **PMO Role**: The PMO often provides the "approved list" of AI tools and templates.
- **Regulatory Compliance**: In some industries (Finance, Healthcare), using AI to make decisions may require specialized "Explainable AI" to show *how* a decision was made.
