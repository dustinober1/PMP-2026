# 10.3 AI in the Project Lifecycle

AI can be applied at every stage of a project to accelerate delivery and reduce manual effort.

---

## 🚀 Initiation
- **Business Case Analysis**: AI can analyze market trends and internal data to help draft the ROI section of a business case.
- **Drafting the Charter**: Provide the AI with the sponsor's high-level goals, and it can draft a preliminary Project Charter for you to refine.

## 📋 Planning
- **WBS Generation**: AI can suggest a Work Breakdown Structure based on your project description.
- **Sprint Backlog Drafting**: Turn raw user notes into formatted User Stories with Acceptance Criteria.
- **Resource Balancing**: Predictive AI can flag potential resource bottlenecks before the project starts.

## ⚡ Execution
- **Meeting Summaries**: Use AI to transcribe meetings and instantly identify Action Items and Decisions.
- **Communication Tailoring**: AI can rewrite a technical update into an "Executive Summary" for the steering committee.

## 📊 Monitoring & Control
- **Sentiment Analysis**: AI can scan stakeholder emails or survey results to detect "hidden" frustration before it becomes an issue.
- **EVM Forecasting**: Predictive tools can look at your current CPI/SPI and project a much more accurate "Estimate at Completion" (EAC) by comparing it to 1,000 similar past projects.

## 🏁 Closing
- **Lessons Learned Clustering**: Feed 500 lines of retrospective notes into an AI to find the 3 most important themes for the organization.
- **Archive Summarization**: Automatically generate a "Project Closeout Report" from the project's historical data.

  <strong>📝 Exam Insight:</strong> AI is an <strong>Input</strong> to your processes. It does not replace the process itself. You still need a Project Charter, you still need a Risk Register; AI just helps you populate them faster.
