# Chapter 10: AI & Project Management

AI is the single most transformative force in modern project management. In the 2026 PMP exam, you aren't expected to be a data scientist, but you *must* be an **AI-Augmented Leader**.

---

## The New Co-Pilot
AI doesn't replace the Project Manager; it replaces the *administrative burden* of project management. Your value shifts from tracking tasks to **interpreting insights**, **making strategy**, and **leading people**.

## What You'll Master (PMP Lens)
By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
*   **Choose the right AI tool** (GenAI vs predictive vs automation) for the job.
*   **Spot the risks** (hallucinations, bias, privacy, over-reliance) and apply guardrails.
*   **Use AI inside PMP workflows** (charters, plans, risks, comms, status, lessons learned) without breaking governance.
*   **Answer exam scenarios** with the correct mindset: policy-first, human judgment always, accountability stays with the PM.

## 2026 Mindset: Human + AI
Success in this new era requires a dual mindset:
*   **The Scientist**: Using AI to analyze massive datasets (e.g., "Predict the probability of a delay based on historical weather patterns").
*   **The Artist**: Using human empathy to negotiate the conflicts that AI predicts but cannot solve.
