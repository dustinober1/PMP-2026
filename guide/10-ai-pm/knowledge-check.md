# Knowledge Check: AI and Project Management

Test your understanding of AI in project management contexts.

## Practice Questions

### Question 1: AI Validation

A project manager uses AI to draft the project risk register. What should the PM do NEXT?

- A) Submit the risk register to the sponsor as-is
- B) Validate the AI output with the team and stakeholders ✓
- C) Delete the AI output and create it manually

### Question 5: AI Ethics

A stakeholder raises concerns about potential bias in an AI-powered hiring tool the project is implementing. What should the PM do?

- A) Dismiss the concern since the AI is 90% accurate
- B) Investigate the concern and involve ethics/legal stakeholders ✓
- C) Remove the stakeholder from the project

### Question 6: AI Use Cases

Which of the following is an appropriate use of AI in project management?

- A) Final decision authority on project changes
- B) Drafting documents that humans then review and validate ✓
- C) Replacing stakeholder engagement
- D) Autonomous budget approval

**Explanation**: AI is best used to draft and assist, with humans providing validation, judgment, and final decisions.

---

### Question 7: Team Working Agreements

When implementing AI tools on a project, the PM should:

- A) Allow each team member to use any AI tool they prefer
- B) Establish team working agreements on AI use ✓
- C) Ban all AI tools to avoid risk
- D) Ignore AI usage since it's a personal choice

**Explanation**: Working agreements create clarity on permitted tools, use cases, and guardrails for AI use.

---

### Question 8: AI Escalation

A project is using AI for predictive risk analysis. The AI flags a risk that the team disagrees with. What should the PM do?

- A) Accept the AI's assessment automatically
- B) Dismiss the AI since the team knows better
- C) Investigate both perspectives and make an informed decision ✓
- D) Escalate to the sponsor without investigation

**Explanation**: AI provides input, not final decisions. The PM should investigate and apply judgment.

---

### Question 9: AI ROI

How should a PM measure the value of AI tools on a project?

- A) Only count cost savings
- B) Use a balanced approach including efficiency, quality, and adoption metrics ✓
