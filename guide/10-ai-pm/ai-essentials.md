# 10.1 AI Essentials for PMs

Project Managers in 2026 don't need to be engineers, but they must understand the **capabilities** and **limitations** of the tools they use.

## 🛠️ Core AI Capabilities
Most AI tools you will use fall into three categories:

1. **Generative AI (LLMs)**:
   - **Drafting**: Charters, emails, user stories, and status reports.
   - **Summarization**: Turning a 1-hour meeting transcript into 5 bullet points.
   - **Brainstorming**: Generating a list of potential risks or technical options.

2. **Predictive Analytics**:
   - **Forecasting**: Using historical data to predict if a project will be late.
   - **Risk Scoring**: Highlighting work items that look like past failures.

3. **Automation & Assistants**:
   - **Workflows**: Automatically moving a task to a different column based on a keyword.
   - **Scheduling**: AI agents that negotiate meeting times across 10 calendars.

## 🔍 The "Hallucination" Problem
AI is a **Probabilistic** engine, not a **Deterministic** one. 
- **Deterministic**: $1 + 1$ always equals $2$.
- **Probabilistic**: AI predicts the *most likely* next word.

::: warning ⚠️ Fact-Check Everything
AI can "hallucinate"—it can invent facts, statistics, or requirements that sound perfectly confident but are completely made up. **Never submit an AI-generated artifact without a human review.**

## 👤 The Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)
PMI emphasizes the "Human-in-the-Loop" model. AI produces the **Draft**; the Human provides the **Judgment**.

| AI Strengths          | Human Strengths           |
| :-------------------- | :------------------------ |
| Speed and Scale       | Empathy and Culture       |
| Pattern Recognition   | Context and Ethics        |
| Processing Large Data | Stakeholder Relationships |

  <strong>📝 Exam Insight:</strong> If an exam question asks "How should a PM use an AI-generated risk list?", the correct answer is usually <strong>"Review the list with the project team to validate and prioritize the risks."</strong>
