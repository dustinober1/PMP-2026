## 🏆 Meaningful Recognition & Reward
A Servant Leader uses recognition as a tool to reinforce high-value behaviors, not just as a "thank you."

*   **Be Specific**: "Great job" is noise. "Your catch on that security bug saved the project two weeks" is recognition.
*   **Be Timely**: A small shout-out *now* is more powerful than a formal award *next quarter*.
*   **Be Equitable**: Rewards given to only "favorites" destroy the psychological safety of the entire team.

## 📈 Performance in the 2026 Era
In virtual and hybrid environments, performance is measured by **Value Delivered**, not "Hours Logged."

1.  **Focus on Outcomes**: Did the team solve the customer's pain point?
2.  **Leading Indicators**: Monitor cycle time and team sentiment to spot drops *before* they impact delivery.
3.  **Whole Person Leadership**: Acknowledge that life stress impacts project performance. Empathy is a performance multiplier.
