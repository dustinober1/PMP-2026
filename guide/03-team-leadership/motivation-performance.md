# 3.4 – Motivation and Performance

## 3.4.1 Introduction

Motivated teams outperform unmotivated teams. Understanding what drives people helps you create environments where team members can do their best work.

::: tip Key Insight
**You can't motivate people directly**—you create conditions where motivation flourishes. Remove demotivators and enable intrinsic motivation.

## 3.4.2 Understanding Motivation

### Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic Motivation

| Type          | Description                   | Examples                    | Effectiveness                       |
| ------------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Intrinsic** | Internal drive                | Mastery, purpose, autonomy  | Long-lasting, self-sustaining       |
| **Extrinsic** | External rewards/consequences | Salary, bonuses, punishment | Short-term, can undermine intrinsic |

### Key Finding

Research shows extrinsic rewards can actually *decrease* intrinsic motivation for creative, complex work (overjustification effect). For knowledge work, focus on creating conditions for intrinsic motivation.

## 3.4.3 Motivation Theories

### Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs

| Level                     | Need                 | Project Environment Applications          |
| ------------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 5. **Self-Actualization** | Reaching potential   | Challenging work, growth opportunities    |
| 4. **Esteem**             | Respect, recognition | Recognition, meaningful contributions     |
| 3. **Belonging**          | Connection, team     | Team activities, inclusion, collaboration |
| 2. **Safety**             | Security, stability  | Job security, clear expectations          |
| 1. **Physiological**      | Basic needs          | Adequate salary, reasonable hours         |

**Key point**: Lower needs must be met before higher needs motivate.

### Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory

| Hygiene Factors (Demotivators) | Motivators      |
| ------------------------------ | --------------- |
| Poor salary                    | Achievement     |
| Poor working conditions        | Recognition     |
| Job insecurity                 | The work itself |
| Poor supervision               | Responsibility  |
| Bureaucracy                    | Advancement     |
| Bad relationships              | Growth          |

**Key point**: Fixing hygiene factors doesn't motivate—it just removes dissatisfaction. True motivation comes from motivator factors.

### McGregor's Theory X and Theory Y

| Theory X                      | Theory Y                     |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| People dislike work           | People find work natural     |
| Must be forced/controlled     | Self-directed when committed |
| Avoid responsibility          | Seek responsibility          |
| Need security above all       | Seek challenge and growth    |
| Motivation through punishment | Motivation through autonomy  |

**Key point**: Theory Y assumptions typically lead to better outcomes for knowledge workers.

### Pink's Drive Theory

Daniel Pink identifies three elements of intrinsic motivation:

| Element      | Description                          | How to Enable                             |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Autonomy** | Control over work                    | Let people choose how they work           |
| **Mastery**  | Getting better at something          | Provide learning opportunities, challenge |
| **Purpose**  | Contributing to something meaningful | Connect work to larger mission            |

## 3.4.4 Recognition and Rewards

### Types of Recognition

| Type           | Examples                       | When Effective                 |
| -------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| **Formal**     | Awards, bonuses, promotions    | Major achievements, milestones |
| **Informal**   | Thank you, public appreciation | Daily good work, effort        |
| **Individual** | Personal recognition           | Stand-out contributions        |
| **Team**       | Celebrating together           | Collective achievements        |

### Effective Recognition Practices

1. **Be specific**: State exactly what the person did well
2. **Be timely**: Recognize soon after the behavior
3. **Be genuine**: Insincere recognition backfires
4. **Match preferences**: Some want public praise; others prefer private
5. **Tie to values**: Connect behavior to team/organizational values

### Common Mistakes

- Recognizing too rarely (or not at all)
- Recognizing only results, not effort
- Making recognition feel like favoritism
- Using recognition as manipulation
- Ignoring cultural preferences

## 3.4.5 Performance Management

### Setting Performance Expectations

Effective expectations are:
- **Clear**: No ambiguity about what success looks like
- **Measurable**: Objective criteria when possible
- **Achievable**: Challenging but realistic
- **Relevant**: Connected to project/organizational goals
- **Time-bound**: Clear deadlines

### Providing Feedback

| Ineffective Feedback    | Effective Feedback                                                                 |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "You need to do better" | "When you miss deadlines, it impacts the team. Let's discuss what's blocking you." |
| "Great job!" (vague)    | "Your analysis caught that critical error before it reached the customer."         |
| Annual review only      | Regular, timely conversations                                                      |
| Public criticism        | Private correction                                                                 |

### Addressing Performance Issues

1. **Gather facts**: Understand what's actually happening
2. **Check for barriers**: Are there obstacles in their way?
3. **Have a direct conversation**: Private, respectful, specific
4. **Agree on improvement plan**: Clear expectations and support
5. **Follow up**: Monitor progress, provide ongoing support
6. **Escalate if needed**: If improvement doesn't occur

## 3.4.6 Empowerment

### What Is Empowerment?

Empowerment means giving team members:
- Authority to make decisions
- Resources to do their work
- Information to decide wisely
- Accountability for outcomes
- Support when they need help

### Benefits of Empowerment

- Faster decisions (no waiting for PM approval)
- Higher engagement and ownership
- Development of team capabilities
- PM freed for higher-value work
- Better solutions (people closest to work often know best)

### Empowerment Barriers

| Barrier                          | Solution                                     |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| PM doesn't trust team            | Build trust gradually, start small           |
| Team doesn't want responsibility | Coach, provide support, build confidence     |
| Organizational culture           | Work within constraints, advocate for change |
| Unclear boundaries               | Define decision rights explicitly            |

## 3.4.7 Team Morale

### Signs of Low Morale

- Increased absenteeism or disengagement
- Reduced productivity and quality
- More conflicts and complaints
- Resistance to change
- Turnover or requests to transfer

### Maintaining Morale

- **Communicate transparently**: Bad news is better than uncertainty

- **Address problems**: Don't ignore issues affecting the team
- **Show appreciation**: Regularly recognize contributions
- **Remove obstacles**: Make it easier for people to do good work
- **Be fair**: Consistent treatment builds trust
- **Protect the team**: Shield from unnecessary organizational drama
