"You can't motivate people; you can only create the environment where they choose to be motivated."

## 🏆 The Art of Recognition
Recognition is the cheapest, most powerful tool in your kit.
*   **Specific**: "Great job" is noise. "Your fix on the API saved us 3 days" is signal.
*   **Timely**: Feedback has a half-life. A compliment given 2 months later is worthless.
*   **Public vs. Private**: Know your team. Introverts may hate public praise; extroverts crave it.

## 🧪 Motivation Diagnosis: What to Check First
On the exam, the right answer is usually the one that diagnoses the environment before jumping to rewards.

1.  **Fix hygiene blockers first** (Herzberg): tools, safety, unrealistic workload, unclear priorities, poor working conditions.
2.  **Then increase motivators**: autonomy, mastery, purpose, responsibility, and meaningful recognition.
3.  **Tailor the approach** (McClelland): some people want achievement, others affiliation, others influence/leadership.

::: warning 🚫 Trap Answer: "Throw money at morale"
Bonuses and perks can reduce dissatisfaction, but they rarely create sustained motivation by themselves.

## 📉 When Performance Drops (The PMI-Friendly Response)
If a team member is missing deadlines, this is the typical best sequence:

1.  **Meet privately**: seek to understand root cause (skill gap, unclear expectations, personal issues, blockers).
2.  **Clarify expectations**: what "done" means, acceptance criteria, and priorities.
3.  **Enable success**: coaching, training, pairing, or removing impediments.
4.  **Agree on a plan**: small milestones + follow-up date.
5.  **Escalate last**: involve functional manager/HR only after support and documentation.

## ⚖️ Fairness Is Fuel (Equity in Plain English)
People compare their effort and rewards to others. If someone feels the system is unfair, motivation drops fast. Transparency in workload, recognition, and decision-making reduces this risk.

  <strong>📝 Exam Insight:</strong> If a team is well-paid but morale is low, giving them a bonus is the wrong answer. According to Herzberg, money is hygiene. To fix morale, you must give them **Growth** (Training) or **Autonomy** (Self-Direction).
