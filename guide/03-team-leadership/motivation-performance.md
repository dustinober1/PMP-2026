# 3.4 Motivation & Performance

"You can't motivate people; you can only create the environment where they choose to be motivated." In the 2026 PMP exam, understanding human drive is the key to unlocking high performance.

## 🏗️ The Pillars of Motivation
You must be familiar with these classic theories for the exam:

### 1. Herzberg’s Two-Factor Theory
Motivation is not a single scale. It consists of:
- **Hygiene Factors (Demotivators)**: Pay, job security, working conditions. If these are missing, people are unhappy. But if they are present, people aren't necessarily motivated—they are just "not unhappy."
- **Motivators**: Achievement, recognition, the work itself. These are what actually drive performance.

### 2. McClelland’s Theory of Needs
People are driven by one of three dominant needs:
- **Need for Achievement**: Desires to solve problems and master complex tasks.
- **Need for Power**: Desires to influence others or control their environment.
- **Need for Affiliation**: Desires friendly relationships and to be liked.

### 3. Theory X & Theory Y (McGregor)
- **Theory X**: Managers believe people are lazy and need to be micromanaged.
- **Theory Y**: Managers believe people are self-motivated and seek responsibility.
- **2026 Focus**: Agile and Hybrid teams operate almost exclusively on **Theory Y**.

## 🏆 Recognition & Reward
A Servant Leader uses recognition to reinforce positive behavior.

| Principle              | Advice for the PM                                                                      |
| :--------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Specificity**        | Don't say "Good job." Say "Your catch on that security bug saved the project 2 weeks." |
| **Timeliness**         | Small rewards given *now* are better than a big bonus given in six months.             |
| **Public vs. Private** | Know your team. Some love a public shoutout; others find it mortifying.                |
| **Equitable**          | If only the "favorites" get rewards, you will destroy team morale.                     |

## 📊 Performance in 2026
In a world of remote work and flexible hours, performance is measured by **Value**, not "Hours at Desk."
- **Focus on Outcomes**: Did the feature solve the customer's problem?
- **Leading Indicators**: Use velocity, cycle time, and team happiness scores to spot performance drops *before* they hit the deadline.
