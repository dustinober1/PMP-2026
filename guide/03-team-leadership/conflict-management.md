# 3.3 Conflict Management

Conflict is not just inevitable in projects; it is often **necessary**. Friction surfaces different perspectives, catch errors early, and can lead to better outcomes. The PM's job is not to avoid conflict, but to manage it.

## 🚦 Common Sources of Conflict
Most project conflicts (about 90%) come from a few predictable areas:
1. **Schedules**: When are things due?
2. **Priorities**: What is most important right now?
3. **Resources**: Who gets the senior architect?
4. **Technical Opinions**: How should we build the database?

::: info 💡 Pro Tip: Personality Clashes
Contrary to popular belief, **Personalities** are usually one of the *least* common sources of conflict in professional projects. If people are arguing, look for a resource or schedule gap first!

## 🧭 The 5 Conflict Resolution Modes
The Thomas-Kilmann model is the gold standard for the PMP exam. You must know when to use each:

| Mode                            | What it is                                         | When to use                                                    |
| :------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Collaborate (Problem Solve)** | Win-Win. Finding a new path together.              | Both relationships and issues are high priority.               |
| **Compromise (Reconcile)**      | Lose-Lose (slightly). Both give up something.      | Temporary fix needed; equal power levels.                      |
| **Smooth (Accommodate)**        | You lose, they win. Putting project harmony first. | Issue is minor; relationship is critical.                      |
| **Force (Direct)**              | You win, they lose. Using your authority.          | **Emergencies**; safety issues; vital but unpopular decisions. |
| **Withdraw (Avoid)**            | No one wins. Tabled for later.                     | Cooling off needed; trivial issue; gathering more info.        |

## 🪜 The Resolution Process
1. **Private First**: Always try to resolve conflict in a **one-on-one** private conversation before involving others.
2. **Focus on Issues, Not People**: Attack the problem, not the person.
3. **Fact-Based**: Move from emotions to data.
4. **Escalate Last**: Only involve the Sponsor or HR if all internal team attempts have failed and the project is at risk.

  <strong>2026 Shift: Generational & Cultural Conflict</strong>
  In modern virtual teams, conflict often stems from different communication styles (e.g., Baby Boomers preferring email vs. Gen Z preferring instant messaging). As a PM, your role is to facilitate a <strong>Communication Agreement</strong> in the Team Charter to normalize these differences.

  <strong>📝 Exam Insight:</strong> If an exam question asks what a PM should do about two team members "bickering" over a technical approach, the best answer is almost always to **let them try to work it out first**, then facilitate a **collaborative** session if they can't.
