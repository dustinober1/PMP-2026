# 3.3 Conflict Management & Negotiation

Conflict is not a sign of failure; it is a sign of passion. If your team never fights, they probably don't care. Your job is to channel that energy into innovation.

## 🚦 The Thomas-Kilmann Conflict Mode Instrument (TKI)
The 5 conflict resolution modes are mapped on two dimensions: **Assertiveness** (concern for self) and **Cooperativeness** (concern for others).

## 🧠 Choosing the Right Mode: The Decision Matrix
The exam often asks for the **best** technique, not the fastest.

| Mode | Use When | What You Gain | What You Risk |
| :--- | :------- | :------------ | :------------ |
| **Collaborate** | Root cause matters and you have time | Best solution + commitment + learning | Slower; requires facilitation skill |
| **Compromise** | Temporary solution is acceptable; time pressure | Quick agreement | Mediocre outcome; may resurface later |
| **Force / Direct** | Emergency, safety, severe compliance | Immediate action | Damaged trust; resentment; no buy-in |
| **Smooth / Accommodate** | Issue is minor or you want to preserve relationship | Short-term harmony | Real issue stays unresolved |
| **Withdraw / Avoid** | Emotions are too high or facts are unclear | Cool-down time | Delays resolution; can fester |

### The Conflict Mode Selection Flowchart
```
Is it urgent & safety-critical?
    YES → FORCE (then repair trust later)
    NO ↓

Are emotions too high for productive discussion?
    YES → WITHDRAW (temporarily) → schedule later
    NO ↓

Is this issue minor or is the relationship more important?
    YES → SMOOTH / ACCOMMODATE
    NO ↓

Do we have time to find the best solution?
    YES → COLLABORATE / PROBLEM SOLVE
    NO → COMPROMISE (temporary fix)
```

::: tip ✅ Exam Pattern: Collaborate is the default "best"
If the scenario is not an emergency, look for choices that involve listening, using data, and jointly creating a solution. Collaborate almost always beats Compromise in non-time-pressured scenarios.

## 🔥 Types of Conflict: Task vs. Relationship
Not all conflict is the same. Understanding the type helps you respond correctly.

| Type | Description | Impact | PM Action |
| :--- | :---------- | :----- | :-------- |
| **Task Conflict** | Disagreement about work (approach, priorities, quality) | Can be healthy; drives innovation | Facilitate; let team debate; guide to decision |
| **Relationship Conflict** | Personal friction, dislike, personality clash | Always harmful; destroys trust | Intervene early; address privately; de-escalate |
| **Process Conflict** | Disagreement about how to work together | Moderate; can be resolved with clarity | Clarify roles, update working agreements |

### The Personality Trap
::: warning ⚠️ Most friction is caused by Scope, Schedule, or Priorities
What looks like a "personality conflict" is usually a process issue:
- "She never listens to me" → Different priorities, unclear decision rights
- "He's impossible to work with" → Competing deadlines, no escalation path
- "They're too difficult" → Unclear scope, different definitions of done

**Always look for the process issue before blaming the person.**

## 🤝 Negotiation Strategies (Task 8)
Conflict often requires negotiation to resolve. On the exam, you need to know *how* you are negotiating.

### Core Negotiation Concepts

#### BATNA (Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement)
Your "Plan B." If you can't reach a deal, what will you do?

**Example**: "If this vendor is too expensive, I can build it in-house for $50k."

**Rules**:
- **Never** negotiate without knowing your BATNA
- The stronger your BATNA, the more leverage you have
- Improve your BATNA before negotiating if possible

#### ZOPA (Zone of Possible Agreement)
The overlap between the seller's minimum price and the buyer's maximum price.

```
Seller's Minimum: $80,000  ────────────────────────────────
                                           ZOPA ($80k-$100k)
Buyer's Maximum: $100,000 ────────────────────────────────
```

If there's no ZOPA, no deal is possible without changing the terms.

#### Reservation Price
The worst acceptable outcome. If the deal is worse than this, walk away.

### The Two Negotiation Strategies
| Strategy | Mindset | Outcome | Use When |
| :------- | :------ | :------ | :------- |
| **Distributive** | "Fixed Pie" (Win-Lose) | I get more, you get less | Buying a car; one-time transaction; no future relationship |
| **Integrative** | "Expand the Pie" (Win-Win) | We find value for both | **Most project situations.** Partnerships, team agreements, long-term contracts |

### Integrative Negotiation Tactics
| Tactic | Description | Example |
| :----- | :---------- | :------ |
| **Interests, not positions** | Ask "why" behind their demand | "Why do you need it by Friday?" → They need a demo for Monday |
| **Create options** | Brainstorm ways to meet both needs | "What if we deliver core features Friday, polish by Monday?" |
| **Objective criteria** | Use data, not opinion | "Industry benchmark says 2 weeks is reasonable" |
| **Separate people from problems** | Focus on the issue, not the person | "The timeline is challenging" not "You're being unrealistic" |

## 🧭 The Conflict Resolution Process
When conflict erupts, follow this escalation ladder:

### Step 1: Self-Correction
Let the team members try to solve it themselves first. Many conflicts resolve without PM intervention.

**PM Action**: Monitor but don't jump in immediately.

### Step 2: Private Intervention
If it persists, facilitate a safe, private conversation.

**PM Action**: Meet 1-on-1 with each party first to understand perspectives.

### Step 3: Collaborative Session
Bring parties together. Use data to remove emotion and focus on the problem.

**PM Action**: Facilitate using the Collaboration Agenda below.

### Step 4: Formal Authority
Make a decision if the team remains deadlocked.

**PM Action**: Decide, explain rationale, and document.

### Step 5: Escalation
Involve sponsor or functional managers only if authority is required.

**PM Action**: Present the issue, options considered, and recommendation.

## 🧩 A Collaboration Agenda (15–30 Minutes)
Use this structure to turn conflict into a decision:

| Step | Time | Action |
| :--- | :--- | :----- |
| **1. State the problem** | 2 min | Neutral language, facts not accusations |
| **2. Confirm interests** | 5 min | What does each side truly need? (time, quality, risk, autonomy) |
| **3. Generate options** | 10 min | Brainstorm first, evaluate second |
| **4. Agree on criteria** | 3 min | Cost, schedule, risk, customer impact, compliance |
| **5. Decide** | 5 min | Choose the best option based on criteria |
| **6. Assign actions** | 2 min | Owner + due date for each action |
| **7. Document** | 1 min | Capture the decision; update team charter if new rule is needed |

### The Ground Rules for the Session
- **Speak for yourself**: Use "I" statements, not "you always"
- **Listen to understand**: No interrupting; paraphrase before responding
- **Focus on interests, not positions**: "I need reliable data" not "I need that specific report"
- **Critique ideas, not people**: "That approach has risks" not "That's a stupid idea"

## 🛠️ De-escalation Techniques
When emotions run high, your first job is to calm the situation before solving it.

### Verbal De-escalation
| Technique | What to Say |
| :-------- | :---------- |
| **Acknowledge** | "I can see this is frustrating for you." |
| **Validate** | "Your concerns are legitimate." |
| **Reframe** | "Let's focus on what we're both trying to achieve." |
| **Pause** | "Let's take a 10-minute break and come back fresh." |
| **Summarize** | "Let me make sure I understand your position..." |

### Physical De-escalation
- Move the conversation to a private space
- Ensure people are seated (standing escalates)
- Offer water/coffee (physiological reset)
- Lower your own voice and slow your speech

## 📋 The Conflict Log
For recurring or significant conflicts, document to identify patterns.

| Date | Parties | Issue Summary | Resolution Mode | Outcome | Follow-up |
| :--- | :------ | :------------ | :-------------- | :------ | :-------- |
| 2026-01-15 | Dev A vs QA | Definition of "done" | Collaborate | Created explicit DoD | Review in Retro |
| 2026-01-20 | PM vs Vendor | Timeline dispute | Compromise | Extended 1 week | Update schedule |

## 🧱 Structural Solutions to Recurring Conflict
If the same conflict keeps happening, fix the system, not just the symptom.

| Pattern | Structural Fix |
| :------ | :------------- |
| **Role confusion** | Create/update RACI |
| **Decision paralysis** | Clarify decision model in team charter |
| **Scope creep battles** | Formalize change control process |
| **Priority fights** | Align on prioritization criteria (value, risk, dependency) |
| **Handoff failures** | Define explicit handoff criteria and checklists |

<div class="study-tip">
  <strong>📝 Exam Insight:</strong> "Compromise" sounds positive in real life, but on the PMP exam, it is often a "Lose-Lose" trap answer. Always look for <strong>Collaboration (Problem Solving)</strong> first. Compromise is only correct when time pressure makes collaboration impossible and the stakes are moderate.
