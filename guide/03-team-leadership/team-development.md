# 3.1b Tuckman's Model & Development

Every team goes through a predictable lifecycle. As a project leader, your style must shift from **Directing** to **Empowering** as the team builds trust and autonomous capability.

## 🧠 Psychological Safety
Identified by Google as the **#1 predictor** of team success. It is the belief that one will not be punished or humiliated for speaking up with ideas, questions, concerns, or mistakes.

*   **Safe to Fail**: Mistakes are seen as opportunities for "Fast Learning."
*   **Safe to Challenge**: Team members can question the status quo without fear.
*   **Safe to Speak**: No "stupid questions"—everyone has a voice.

::: warning 💡 Pro Tip: Regression is Real
Adding a new member or losing a key player will often knock a project team from **Performing** all the way back to **Storming**. Be prepared to shift your leadership style back to "Coaching" when this happens.
