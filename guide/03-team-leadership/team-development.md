Every team goes through a predictable lifecycle. As a Project Manager, your leadership style must shift depending on which stage your team is currently in.

## 🪜 The Five Stages of Team Development

| Stage          | What's Happening?                                    | Your Leadership Style                                |
| :------------- | :--------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------- |
| **Forming**    | Polite, guarded, looking for direction.              | **Directing**: Clear goals, defined roles.           |
| **Storming**   | Friction, ego clashes, questioning the PM.           | **Coaching**: Managing conflict, fostering trust.    |
| **Norming**    | Habits form, trust builds, team finds a rhythm.      | **Supporting**: Facilitating, less hands-on.         |
| **Performing** | Peak efficiency, self-organizing, autonomous.        | **Delegating**: Getting out of the way!              |
| **Adjourning** | Project wrap-up, potential anxiety about next roles. | **Celebrating**: Recognition and transition support. |

## 🧠 Psychological Safety
Identified by Google as the #1 predictor of team success.
- **Safe to fail**: Mistakes are treated as data, not crimes.
- **Safe to speak**: No fear of ridicule for asking "stupid" questions.
- **Safe to challenge**: The status quo can be questioned by anyone.

::: tip 💡 Pro Tip: Regression is Real
Adding a new member or losing a key player will often knock a project team from **Performing** all the way back to **Storming**. Be prepared to shift your leadership style back to "Coaching" or "Directing" when this happens.
