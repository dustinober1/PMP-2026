# 3.1b Tuckman's Model & Team Development

Every team goes through a predictable lifecycle. As a project leader, your style must shift from **Directing** to **Empowering** as the team builds trust and autonomous capability.

## 🪜 The Five Stages of Growth (Tuckman's Model)
The Tuckman model is the foundation for understanding team dynamics on the PMP exam. Know the stage, know the leadership style.

### Detailed Stage Characteristics

| Stage | Team Behavior | PM Focus | Common Challenges |
| :---- | :------------ | :------- | :---------------- |
| **Forming** | Polite, cautious, testing boundaries | Provide clear direction, introduce team, set expectations | Unclear roles, hesitation to contribute |
| **Storming** | Conflict, competition, challenging authority | Facilitate conflict, reinforce norms, build trust | Power struggles, blame, low productivity |
| **Norming** | Cohesion, shared language, mutual support | Support decision-making, delegate more | Groupthink, avoiding healthy conflict |
| **Performing** | High efficiency, self-managing, innovation | Stay out of the way, remove blockers | Complacency, over-confidence |
| **Adjourning** | Sadness, uncertainty, disengagement | Celebrate, recognize, support transitions | Loss of motivation, knowledge loss |

## 🧠 Psychological Safety: The #1 Predictor of Team Success
Identified by Google's **Project Aristotle** research as the most important factor in high-performing teams. Psychological safety is the belief that one will not be punished or humiliated for speaking up with ideas, questions, concerns, or mistakes.

### The Five Factors from Project Aristotle
| Factor | Description | How to Build It |
| :----- | :---------- | :-------------- |
| **Psychological Safety** | Safe to take risks and be vulnerable | Model fallibility; react positively to mistakes |
| **Dependability** | Team members complete quality work on time | Clear expectations; hold people accountable |
| **Structure & Clarity** | Clear roles, plans, and goals | RACI, team charter, visible work |
| **Meaning** | Work is personally important | Connect tasks to larger purpose |
| **Impact** | Team believes their work matters | Share customer feedback and outcomes |

### Signs of Low Psychological Safety
- People stay silent in meetings, even when they disagree
- Mistakes are hidden rather than surfaced
- Only the loudest voices contribute ideas
- "I told you so" culture after failures
- Fear of asking "dumb questions"

### Building Safety: Leader Behaviors
1. **Acknowledge your own mistakes publicly**: "I was wrong about X, and here's what I learned."
2. **Thank people for raising problems**: "I'm glad you brought this up early."
3. **Ask questions, don't just tell**: "What do you think we should do?"
4. **Respond constructively to failure**: Focus on learning, not blame.
5. **Celebrate vulnerability**: Recognize when someone admits uncertainty.

::: warning 💡 Pro Tip: Regression is Real
Adding a new member or losing a key player will often knock a project team from **Performing** all the way back to **Storming**. Be prepared to shift your leadership style back to "Coaching" when this happens.

## 🔄 The Situational Leadership (SLII) Connection
Tuckman's stages align with Situational Leadership styles. As the team matures, your style must evolve.

| Tuckman Stage | Development Level | Leadership Style | What You Do |
| :------------ | :---------------- | :--------------- | :---------- |
| **Forming** | D1 (Low Skill, High Will) | **S1: Directing** | Tell, instruct, provide structure |
| **Storming** | D2 (Some Skill, Low Will) | **S2: Coaching** | Explain why, encourage, manage conflict |
| **Norming** | D3 (High Skill, Variable Will) | **S3: Supporting** | Ask questions, facilitate, collaborate |
| **Performing** | D4 (High Skill, High Will) | **S4: Delegating** | Trust, empower, get out of the way |

::: tip ✅ Exam Pattern: Match Style to Stage
If the question describes a "new team with unclear roles," think **Forming → Directing**. If the team is "arguing about approaches," think **Storming → Coaching**. If the team is "running smoothly," think **Performing → Delegating**.

## 🛠️ Develop the Team: Practical Techniques
The PMP doesn't just test theory; it tests whether you know how to move a team forward.

### Training & Development Options
| Method | Best For | Duration | Investment |
| :----- | :------- | :------- | :--------- |
| **Formal Training** | New tools, certifications, domain knowledge | Days/Weeks | High |
| **Coaching** | Performance issues, skill refinement | Ongoing | Medium |
| **Mentoring** | Career growth, organizational navigation | Months/Years | Low/Medium |
| **Pair Programming** | Knowledge transfer, quality | Ongoing | Low |
| **Job Shadowing** | Cross-functional exposure | Days | Low |
| **Stretch Assignments** | Leadership development | Weeks/Months | Low |

### Team Building Activities (That Actually Work)
- **Problem-solving workshops**: Real project challenges tackled collaboratively
- **Retrospectives**: Regular reflection on what's working and what's not
- **Recognition rituals**: Public acknowledgment of contributions
- **Shared experiences**: Kickoffs, off-sites, virtual social events
- **Cross-training**: Pair people with different expertise

### What Doesn't Work
- **Forced fun**: Activities people resent
- **Competition between team members**: Creates silos
- **One-time events without follow-up**: Trust needs continuous investment

---

## 📈 Team Performance Assessments (TPAs)
A TPA is a regular, intentional check-in on how well the team is functioning (not just whether tasks are "done").

### Quantitative Metrics
| Metric | What It Measures | Warning Signs |
| :----- | :--------------- | :------------ |
| **Velocity/Throughput** | Work completed per iteration | Declining or erratic trend |
| **Cycle Time** | Time from start to finish | Increasing over time |
| **Defect Rate** | Quality of output | Rising defects |
| **Escaped Defects** | Issues found in production | Increasing |
| **Staff Turnover** | Team stability | People leaving |
| **Attendance** | Engagement | Increased absences |

### Qualitative Inputs
- **1-on-1 conversations**: Direct feedback on morale, blockers, relationships
- **Retrospectives**: Team-generated improvement ideas
- **Team health surveys**: Anonymous assessment of safety, clarity, workload
- **Observation**: Reading body language, meeting dynamics, communication patterns

### TPA Outputs
- Improvement actions (process tweaks, working agreement updates)
- Targeted training/coaching plans
- Clearer roles and decision rights (RACI / Team Charter)
- Recognition and celebration of what's working

## 🧯 If Your Team Is Stuck in Storming
Storming is normal—but it should be time-boxed. If it drags on, productivity suffers.

### The Escape Plan
1. **Reset the goal**: Confirm what success looks like and what "done" means
2. **Clarify ownership**: RACI for the next set of deliverables
3. **Facilitate collaboration**: Bring data, surface assumptions, and align on a decision rule
4. **Reinforce safety**: Make it safe to disagree about ideas without attacking people
5. **Recognize progress**: Celebrate small wins to accelerate Norming

### Root Causes of Prolonged Storming
| Symptom | Possible Cause | Action |
| :------ | :------------- | :----- |
| **Role confusion** | Missing or unclear RACI | Facilitate role clarification session |
| **Technical disagreement** | No decision criteria | Agree on evaluation criteria, then decide |
| **Personality clash** | Actually a process issue | Dig for the real constraint (scope, schedule, autonomy) |
| **Power struggles** | Unclear authority | Clarify decision rights in team charter |
| **Low trust** | New team or past conflict | Invest in relationship-building and 1-on-1s |

## 🔁 Team Development Is Continuous
High-performing teams don't stay high-performing automatically. Development is an ongoing investment.

### The Continuous Improvement Cycle
1. **Observe**: Watch for signs of regression, friction, or disengagement
2. **Assess**: Use TPAs, retros, and 1-on-1s to diagnose
3. **Adjust**: Update working agreements, training plans, or team composition
4. **Re-evaluate**: Check if changes are having the desired effect

### Triggers for Re-Assessment
- New team member joins
- Key member leaves
- Major scope change
- Missed deadlines
- Rising conflict
- Feedback indicating low morale

  <strong>📝 Exam Insight:</strong> If team members are "arguing over technical approaches" or "challenging the PM's authority," they are in <strong>Storming</strong>. This isn't a failure—it is a mandatory step toward <strong>Performing</strong>. Your job is to coach them through it, not to suppress the conflict.
