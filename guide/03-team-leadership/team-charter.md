# 3.1c Team Charters & Social Contracts

High-performing teams don't assume how they will work; they define it. The **Team Charter** is the "North Star" for team behavior, collaboration, and collective accountability.

## 📜 The Team Charter
A living document created **by the team, for the team**. It sets the guardrails for a high-trust culture.

<div class="charter-grid">
  <div class="charter-card">
    <div class="charter-title">Team Values</div>
    <p>What do we stand for? (e.g., Integrity, Radical Transparency, Respect).</p>
  </div>
  <div class="charter-card">
    <div class="charter-title">Ground Rules</div>
    <p>Behavioral "laws" (e.g., "Always have cameras on," "No phones during standups").</p>
  </div>
  <div class="charter-card">
    <div class="charter-title">Communication</div>
    <p>Tools and norms: Slack for quick syncs, Email for formal updates, Jira for tasks.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="charter-card">
    <div class="charter-title">Decision Making</div>
    <p>How do we decide? (e.g., Majority vote, Consensus, or PM as tie-breaker).</p>
  </div>
</div>

## 🚦 Establishing Ground Rules
Ground rules are only effective if they follow these three principles:
1.  **Collaborative**: The team must write them to "own" them.
2.  **Visible**: Displayed prominently in the physical or digital project space.
3.  **Self-Policing**: High-performing teams call out rule violations themselves, without needing the PM to play "police officer."

::: info 🛠️ 2026 Focus: Adaptive Agreements
In an Agile or Hybrid context, the Team Charter is not static. It is reviewed during every **Retrospective**. If a rule (e.g., "Meetings at 9:00 AM") is causing friction (e.g., child-care commutes), the team changes it immediately to optimize flow.

  <strong>📝 Exam Insight:</strong> If a team is having constant minor behavioral issues (e.g., people interrupting each other), the correct action is to <strong>refer the team to the Ground Rules</strong> or facilitate a session to <strong>update the Team Charter</strong>.

<style>
.study-tip {
  background: var(--vp-c-brand-soft);
