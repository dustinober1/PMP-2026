# 3.1c Team Charters & Ground Rules

High-performing teams don't assume how they will work; they define it. The **Team Charter** is the "North Star" for team behavior and collaboration.

## 📜 The Team Charter
A living document created **by the team, for the team**. 

| Component               | What it defines                                                       |
| :---------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Team Values**         | What do we stand for? (e.g., Transparency, Respect).                  |
| **Ground Rules**        | Behavioral "laws" (e.g., "No phones in meetings").                    |
| **Conflict Resolution** | How will we handle disagreements before they escalate?                |
| **Communication**       | Which tools for what? (e.g., Slack for quick sync, Email for formal). |
| **Decision Making**     | Majority vote? Consensus? PM final call?                              |

## 🚦 Establishing Ground Rules
Ground rules are only effective if they are:
1. **Collaborative**: The team must write them to buy into them.
2. **Visible**: Put them on the wall or the digital dashboard.
3. **Consistently Applied**: The PM must follow them too!

In an Agile or Hybrid context, the Team Charter is often reviewed during every **Retrospective**. If a rule isn't working, the team changes it immediately.

## 🏗️ Shared Responsibility
A key 2026 concept is moving from "command and control" to **shared accountability**. The Team Charter shifts the burden of discipline from the Project Manager to the team itself (e.g., team members calling each other out on ground rule violations).

  <strong>📝 Exam Insight:</strong> If a team is having constant minor behavioral issues (e.g., people arriving late or speaking over each other), the correct action is to <strong>refer the team to the Ground Rules</strong> or have a session to <strong>create a Team Charter</strong>.
