# 3.1c Team Charters & Social Contracts

High-performing teams don't assume how they will work; they define it. The **Team Charter** is the "North Star" for team behavior, collaboration, and collective accountability.

## 📜 The Team Charter
A living document created **by the team, for the team**. It sets the guardrails for a high-trust culture.

<div class="charter-grid">
  <div class="charter-card">
    <div class="charter-title">Team Values</div>
    <p>What do we stand for? (e.g., Integrity, Radical Transparency, Respect).</p>
  </div>
  <div class="charter-card">
    <div class="charter-title">Ground Rules</div>
    <p>Behavioral "laws" (e.g., "Always have cameras on," "No phones during standups").</p>
  </div>
  <div class="charter-card">
    <div class="charter-title">Communication</div>
    <p>Tools and norms: Slack for quick syncs, Email for formal updates, Jira for tasks.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="charter-card">
    <div class="charter-title">Decision Making</div>
    <p>How do we decide? (e.g., Majority vote, Consensus, or PM as tie-breaker).</p>

## 🧾 Team Charter Template (Copy/Paste)
Your charter should be short, clear, and reviewed regularly. Use this checklist as a starting point:

- [ ] **Purpose & outcomes**: what success looks like and why the work matters
- [ ] **Roles & responsibilities**: link to (or embed) the RACI for major deliverables
- [ ] **Working hours & availability**: time zones, core overlap hours, PTO rules
- [ ] **Communication**: channels + response-time expectations (async vs sync)
- [ ] **Meeting norms**: who facilitates, agenda rules, note-taking, decision recording
- [ ] **Decision making**: how decisions are made and who breaks ties
- [ ] **Conflict & escalation**: how we disagree, how we resolve, when we escalate
- [ ] **Quality rules**: acceptance criteria / Definition of Done, review/testing expectations
- [ ] **Tooling**: where work lives (board), where docs live, where decisions are captured
- [ ] **Continuous improvement**: retro cadence and how the charter is updated

## 🚦 Establishing Ground Rules
Ground rules are only effective if they follow these three principles:
1.  **Collaborative**: The team must write them to "own" them.
2.  **Visible**: Displayed prominently in the physical or digital project space.
3.  **Self-Policing**: High-performing teams call out rule violations themselves, without needing the PM to play "police officer."

::: info 🛠️ 2026 Focus: Adaptive Agreements
In an Agile or Hybrid context, the Team Charter is not static. It is reviewed during every **Retrospective**. If a rule (e.g., "Meetings at 9:00 AM") is causing friction (e.g., child-care commutes), the team changes it immediately to optimize flow.

## 🗳️ Decision Models (When to Use Which)
Decision rules prevent "hidden rework" caused by repeating the same debate.

| Model | Best when | Risk |
| :---- | :-------- | :--- |
| **Consensus** | High-impact decisions that require buy-in | Slow if not time-boxed |
| **Majority vote** | Time-boxed decisions with moderate impact | Minority may disengage |
| **Expert / delegated** | Specialized technical decisions | Others may feel excluded |
| **PM decides** | Emergencies, safety, severe compliance | Lower buy-in long term |
| **Sponsor decides** | Cross-org tradeoffs beyond team authority | Over-escalation if used often |

## 🧯 Conflict & Escalation Path (Put This in the Charter)
Conflict is inevitable. Chaos is optional.

1.  **Direct conversation**: address the issue quickly and respectfully (assume positive intent).
2.  **Facilitated session**: PM/Scrum Master helps clarify facts, options, and tradeoffs.
3.  **Wider alignment**: involve functional managers or impacted stakeholders for constraints.
4.  **Escalate (last)**: sponsor/steering committee decides when authority is required.

  <strong>📝 Exam Insight:</strong> If a team is having constant minor behavioral issues (e.g., people interrupting each other), the correct action is to <strong>refer the team to the Ground Rules</strong> or facilitate a session to <strong>update the Team Charter</strong>.
