# 3.1 – Building and Leading Teams

## 3.1.1 Introduction

Projects are delivered by people. Your success as a project manager depends on your ability to build, develop, and lead teams that can execute effectively. This section covers the fundamentals of team formation, development, and performance.

::: tip Key Insight
High-performing teams don't happen by accident—they are deliberately built and continuously developed.

## 3.1.2 Team Composition

### Factors in Team Composition

When building a team, consider:

| Factor                | Description                                     |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Skills**            | Technical capabilities needed for project work  |
| **Experience**        | Relevant domain and project experience          |
| **Availability**      | When and how much team members are available    |
| **Location**          | Co-located, distributed, remote                 |
| **Diversity**         | Different perspectives, backgrounds, approaches |
| **Interpersonal Fit** | How personalities will work together            |

### Acquiring Project Team

Team acquisition may involve:

- **Negotiation** with functional managers for resources
- **Hiring** new team members for the project
- **Contracting** external resources
- **Virtual teams** assembled across locations and time zones

### Resource Management Considerations

- **Dedicated vs. shared resources**: Dedicated team members focus solely on your project; shared resources split time across projects
- **Skills matrix**: Document team capabilities to identify gaps
- **Training needs**: Plan for skill development if gaps exist

## 3.1.3 Tuckman's Stages of Team Development

Bruce Tuckman's model describes how teams evolve:

### The Five Stages

| Stage          | Description          | Team Behavior                                | PM Actions                                     |
| -------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Forming**    | Team comes together  | Polite, cautious, dependent on leader        | Provide direction, clarify goals               |
| **Storming**   | Conflict emerges     | Disagreements, power struggles, frustration  | Facilitate conflict resolution, maintain focus |
| **Norming**    | Team cohesion builds | Trust develops, roles clarify, collaboration | Support team decisions, step back              |
| **Performing** | High performance     | Self-organizing, focused, productive         | Remove obstacles, delegate                     |
| **Adjourning** | Project ends         | Reflection, transition, potential anxiety    | Celebrate, capture lessons, help transition    |

### Key Points to Remember

- **Not all teams reach Performing**: Some get stuck in Storming
- **Regression is common**: Team changes can push back to earlier stages
- **Stages can overlap**: Teams may exhibit behaviors from multiple stages
- **Time varies**: Some teams move quickly; others take longer

::: warning Exam Alert
Know which stage a team is in based on described behaviors, and what the PM should do to help them progress.

## 3.1.4 Roles, Responsibilities, and Authority

### Defining Roles

Clear role definition prevents confusion:

| Tool                  | Purpose                                                     |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **RACI Matrix**       | Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed for each task |
| **Role Descriptions** | Formal documentation of each role's responsibilities        |
| **Team Charter**      | Agreement on how the team will work together                |
| **Org Chart**         | Visual representation of reporting relationships            |

### RACI Matrix

| Task                | Project Manager | Developer | Tester | Sponsor |
| ------------------- | --------------- | --------- | ------ | ------- |
| Define Requirements | A               | C         | C      | I       |
| Develop Code        | I               | R         | C      | I       |
| Test Software       | C               | C         | R/A    | I       |
| Approve Release     | C               | I         | I      | A       |

**R** = Responsible (does the work), **A** = Accountable (final authority), **C** = Consulted, **I** = Informed

### Authority and Decision Rights

Clarify:
- What decisions the team can make autonomously
- What requires PM approval
- What requires sponsor or stakeholder approval
- Escalation paths for unresolved issues

## 3.1.5 Virtual and Distributed Teams

### Challenges of Virtual Teams

| Challenge                | Impact                                          |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Time zones**           | Scheduling difficulties, delayed responses      |
| **Communication**        | Reduced informal interaction, misunderstandings |
| **Trust**                | Harder to build without face-to-face contact    |
| **Isolation**            | Team members may feel disconnected              |
| **Cultural differences** | Different norms, communication styles           |

### Best Practices for Virtual Teams

1. **Establish clear communication norms**: When to use email, chat, video, etc.
2. **Create regular touchpoints**: Daily standups, weekly syncs (accommodate time zones)
3. **Use collaboration tools**: Shared workspaces, visibility into work status
4. **Build relationships intentionally**: Virtual social activities, video-on meetings
5. **Document decisions**: Important information accessible to all time zones
6. **Rotate meeting times**: Share the burden of inconvenient timing
7. **Meet in person when possible**: Kickoffs, key milestones, team building

## 3.1.6 Ground Rules and Team Agreements

### Purpose of Ground Rules

Ground rules establish behavioral norms:
- How decisions are made
- How conflicts are handled
- Meeting expectations (on time, prepared, engaged)
- Communication protocols
- Work hours and availability

### Creating Team Agreements

Effective team agreements are:
- **Developed collaboratively**: Team owns them, not dictated by PM
- **Clear and specific**: Actionable behaviors, not vague principles
- **Visible**: Posted where team can see them
- **Enforced consistently**: Applied to everyone, including the PM
- **Revisited regularly**: Updated as team evolves

### Example Ground Rules

- We start meetings on time and end on time
- We listen actively and don't interrupt
- We disagree constructively—attack problems, not people
- We complete commitments or communicate early if at risk
- We give and receive feedback with respect

## 3.1.7 Creating Psychological Safety

### What Is Psychological Safety?

Psychological safety means team members feel safe to:
- Ask questions without looking stupid
- Admit mistakes without punishment
- Offer ideas without ridicule
- Challenge the status quo without retaliation

### Why It Matters

Google's Project Aristotle found psychological safety was the #1 factor distinguishing high-performing teams.

### How Leaders Create It

- **Admit your own mistakes**: Model vulnerability
- **Respond positively to questions**: Encourage curiosity
- **Thank people for raising concerns**: Reward speaking up
- **Separate people from problems**: Address issues, not individuals
- **Follow through**: Act on feedback to show it matters

2. **Teams evolve predictably**: Tuckman's stages guide PM actions
3. **Clarity enables performance**: Roles, responsibilities, and authority must be clear
4. **Virtual teams need extra attention**: Communication and trust require deliberate effort
5. **Ground rules set expectations**: Collaboratively created and consistently enforced
