# 3.1 Building Teams

**ECO Task**: Manage conflicts in the project team
**ECO Task**: Plan and manage resources

Projects don't fail; teams do. Your primary accountability is to assemble a diverse group of strangers and transform them into a cohesive value-delivery engine.

##  The 2026 Core Competency: Psychological Safety

<ConceptGrid>
  <ConceptCard title="Safety">
    "I can ask a dumb question without being mocked."
  </ConceptCard>
  <ConceptCard title="Trust">
    "I know you have my back when things go wrong."
  </ConceptCard>
  <ConceptCard title="Diversity">
    "We solve problems better because we think differently."
  </ConceptCard>
</ConceptGrid>

::: tip  Exam Mindset: Psychological Safety
Building a team isn't just about hiring smart people. It's about creating an environment where **bad news travels fast**. If your team is afraid to tell you about a delay, you are failing.

##  PMI Lens: Acquire → Develop → Manage the Team
On the PMP exam, most "people problems" are really asking which of these three verbs you should apply **first**.

| PMI Verb | What you're trying to do | Artifacts you typically use | Common exam cues |
| :------- | :----------------------- | :-------------------------- | :--------------- |
| **Acquire Team** | Get the right people with the right availability | Resource management plan, staff assignments, resource calendars, **skills matrix**, **RACI** | Missing skills, no availability, matrix org negotiation |
| **Develop Team** | Improve skills, trust, and collaboration | **Team charter**, ground rules, training, mentoring, team-building, recognition | New team, Storming, low trust, skill gaps |
| **Manage Team** | Track performance and resolve issues | **1-on-1s**, issue log, conflict resolution, feedback, change requests | Underperformance, blockers, conflict, repeated missed commitments |

::: tip  Exam Pattern: Clarity → Support → Escalate (last)
If the choices include "meet privately," "clarify roles," "remove impediments," or "refer to the team charter," those are usually better than replacing people or escalating immediately.
