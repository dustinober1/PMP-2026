# 3.1a Team Formation

A high-performing team is more than just a group of talented individuals; it is a balanced ecosystem of skills, personalities, and shared goals.

## 🏗️ Skills Matrix & Composition
Before the work begins, the Project Manager must ensure the team has the right mix of capabilities.

| Factor               | PM Action                                                                |
| :------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Technical Skills** | Create a **Skills Matrix** to identify gaps early.                       |
| **Diversity**        | Ensure a mix of perspectives to avoid "Groupthink."                      |
| **Availability**     | Negotiate with functional managers for dedicated time vs. shared.        |
| **Experience**       | Balance senior mentors with junior learners to ensure project longevity. |

## 📋 The RACI Matrix
The most common tool for defining roles and responsibilities.

- **R (Responsible)**: The "doer." The person who actually completes the task.
- **A (Accountable)**: The "owner." The one person who must sign off and is ultimate responsible for the quality. **(Only one "A" per task!)**
- **C (Consulted)**: Subject matter experts who provide input before the task is done.
- **I (Informed)**: Stakeholders who are kept up to date on progress but don't perform the work.

::: warning 🚦 Exam Trap: Multiple Accountables
If an exam scenario shows multiple people being "Accountable" for the same task, it's a recipe for failure. There should only be **one** neck to wring.

## 🤝 Negotiating for Resources
In a functional or matrix organization, you rarely "own" your team. You must negotiate for them:
1. **Understand the Functional Manager's priorities.**
2. **Present the project's strategic value.**
3. **Escalate to the Sponsor** only if a critical resource gap threatens the project's viability.
