# 3.1a Team Formation

A high-performing team is more than just a group of talented individuals; it is a balanced ecosystem of skills, personalities, and shared goals. The project manager's task is to assemble and acquire the right mix of capabilities for the mission.

## 📋 The RACI Matrix
The gold standard for defining roles and responsibilities.

*   **R (Responsible)**: The "doer." The person who actually performs the task.
*   **A (Accountable)**: The "owner." The one person who must sign off. **(Only one "A" per task!)**
*   **C (Consulted)**: Subject matter experts who provide input before the task is finalized.
*   **I (Informed)**: Stakeholders who are kept up-to-date on progress but don't perform work.

::: warning 🚦 Exam Trap: Multiple Accountables
If an exam scenario shows multiple people being "Accountable" for the same task, it's a recipe for confusion. There should only be **one** person ultimate responsible for the outcome.

## 🤝 Negotiating for Resources
In matrix organizations, you often "borrow" your team.
1.  **Alignment**: Show the functional manager how the project supports their department's goals.
2.  **Strategic Value**: Present the project's high-level business case and impact.
3.  **Escalation**: Only involve the Sponsor if a critical resource gap threatens project viability.
