# 3.1a Team Formation

A high-performing team is more than just a group of talented individuals; it is a balanced ecosystem of skills, personalities, and shared goals. The project manager's task is to assemble and acquire the right mix of capabilities for the mission.

## 🏗️ Skills Matrix & Composition
Before the work begins, the Project Manager must ensure the team has the right mix of capabilities.

## 🧮 A Simple Skills Matrix (Example)
The exam often describes a team that is "missing a skill" or "struggling with new technology." Your first move is to make the gap visible.

| Skill / Role | Dev A | Dev B | QA | Analyst |
| :----------- | :---: | :---: | :-: | :-----: |
| Domain knowledge | 2 | 1 | 1 | 3 |
| API integration | 3 | 2 | 1 | 1 |
| Test automation | 1 | 0 | 3 | 0 |
| Stakeholder facilitation | 1 | 1 | 0 | 3 |

**How to use it (Gap Analysis):**
1.  Rate current capability (e.g., 0–3).
2.  Identify the lowest-scoring skills that are critical-path or high-risk.
3.  Pick a response: **train**, **coach/pair**, **acquire** (hire/contract), or **adjust scope/schedule**.

## 📋 The RACI Matrix
The gold standard for defining roles and responsibilities.

*   **R (Responsible)**: The "doer." The person who actually performs the task.
*   **A (Accountable)**: The "owner." The one person who must sign off. **(Only one "A" per task!)**
*   **C (Consulted)**: Subject matter experts who provide input before the task is finalized.
*   **I (Informed)**: Stakeholders who are kept up-to-date on progress but don't perform work.

::: warning 🚦 Exam Trap: Multiple Accountables
If an exam scenario shows multiple people being "Accountable" for the same task, it's a recipe for confusion. There should only be **one** person ultimate responsible for the outcome.

## 🤝 Negotiating for Resources
In matrix organizations, you often "borrow" your team.
1.  **Alignment**: Show the functional manager how the project supports their department's goals.
2.  **Strategic Value**: Present the project's high-level business case and impact.
3.  **Escalation**: Only involve the Sponsor if a critical resource gap threatens project viability.

## 🧭 Team Acquisition Options (How You Actually Staff a Project)
When a scenario says you "need a specialist" or "cannot get a key resource," think through these options in order:

1.  **Pre-assigned**: Named resources already committed in the charter or contract.
2.  **Negotiate**: Work with functional managers to secure time and clarify priorities.
3.  **Acquire externally**: Contractors, vendors, or a shared services group.
4.  **Upskill**: Training, mentoring, or pairing to close the gap.

::: tip ✅ Exam Pattern: Present choices, not complaints
The strongest PM answer is usually: identify the gap with data (skills/capacity), propose options (tradeoffs), then escalate only if needed.

## 🚀 Onboarding: Turning "Names on a Roster" Into a Team
If you want to avoid a long Storming phase, do an intentional kickoff:

*   **Set the mission**: what success looks like and why the project matters.
*   **Clarify roles**: RACI for key deliverables and decision points.
*   **Establish working agreements**: team charter, tools, communication norms, and conflict path.
*   **Create an early win**: a small deliverable that builds confidence and trust quickly.
