::: info  People Domain Impact
The People domain is **42% of the exam**. (People + Business > Process). If you can calculate EVM but can't resolve a conflict, you will **fail**.

## 2026 Mindset: The "Servant PM"

### Core Principles
*   **Don't Direct, Support**: Ask "What do you need?" instead of "Why isn't this done?"
*   **Don't Blame, Learn**: Retrospectives are for process improvement, not finger-pointing.
*   **Don't Ignore, Engage**: Conflict is healthy if it's task-based. Emotional conflict must be defused proactively.

### Key Concepts at a Glance

| Topic | Core Concept | PMI Preference |
| :---- | :----------- | :------------- |

| **Conflict** | Thomas-Kilmann 5 modes | Collaborate > Compromise; Force for emergencies |
| **Motivation** | Herzberg's Two-Factor | Fix hygiene first, then add motivators |
| **Virtual Teams** | Distance Tax mitigation | Explicit agreements; async-first |
