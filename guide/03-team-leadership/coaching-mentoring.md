## 3.2.4 Emotional Intelligence (EQ)

### What Is Emotional Intelligence?

Emotional intelligence is the ability to recognize, understand, and manage emotions—both your own and others'.

### Four Domains of EQ (Goleman Model)

| --------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Self-Awareness**          | Knowing your own emotions    | Recognizing when you're frustrated |
| **Self-Management**         | Controlling your emotions    | Remaining calm under pressure      |
| **Social Awareness**        | Reading others' emotions     | Sensing when a team is stressed    |
| **Relationship Management** | Influencing others' emotions | Inspiring, resolving conflict      |

### Why EQ Matters for Project Managers

- **Conflict resolution**: Understanding underlying emotions
- **Stakeholder management**: Reading concerns, building trust
- **Team leadership**: Motivating, supporting, coaching
- **Difficult conversations**: Delivering bad news effectively
- **Stress management**: Staying effective under pressure

### Developing EQ

1. **Practice self-reflection**: Notice your emotional reactions
2. **Seek feedback**: Ask how your behavior affects others

4. **Practice empathy**: Actively try to understand others' perspectives
5. **Name emotions**: Build vocabulary for emotional states

| ----------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------- |

## 3.2.6 Influence Without Authority

| **Referent**    | Respected as a person       | Build relationships, act with integrity |
| **Reward**      | Ability to provide rewards  | Recognition, opportunities, visibility  |
| **Legitimate**  | Formal position power       | Use sparingly; rely on other sources    |
| **Information** | Control of information flow | Share transparently to build trust      |
