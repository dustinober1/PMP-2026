# 3.2 Servant Leadership & Style

In the 2026 PMP exam, the era of "Command & Control" is over. Success is driven by the **Servant Leader**—the project manager who views their primary mission as serving the team and removing blockers.

## 🛡️ The Servant Leader Mindset
The primary goal of a Servant Leader is to **remove obstacles** so the team can perform at their highest potential.

| Traditional Manager                         | Servant Leader                                 |
| :------------------------------------------ | :--------------------------------------------- |
| Focuses on control and individual reporting | Focuses on **empowerment** and team service    |
| Asks: "Why are you late with this task?"    | Asks: "What is blocking you from finishing?"   |
| Claims credit for team successes            | Deflects credit to the team                    |
| Cascades pressure down                      | **Shields the team** from organizational noise |

::: info 🛠️ 2026 Focus: Removing Blockers
Your most critical daily action is identifying and neutralizing **Impediments, Obstacles, and Blockers**. If you aren't clearing the path, you aren't leading.

## 🧭 Situational Leadership (The SLII Model)
No single leadership style works for every person. You must adapt your style based on the **Follower's Readiness** (Skill + Will).

## 🎓 Coaching vs. Mentoring
While often confused, these serve distinct strategic purposes:

*   **Coaching**: Short-term and **Task-focused**. It is about improving a specific skill (e.g., "Help a team member use a new AI tool").
*   **Mentoring**: Long-term and **Career-focused**. It is about professional growth (e.g., "Advise a junior PM on their leadership path").

## 🧠 Emotional Intelligence (EQ)
EQ is the "secret sauce" of leading through change. It consists of four quadrants:
1.  **Self-Awareness**: Recognizing your triggers before you react.
2.  **Self-Management**: Controlling your responses under project stress.
3.  **Social Awareness**: Reading the "room" (Empathy) and sensing team burnout.
4.  **Relationship Management**: influencing stakeholders and resolving team friction.

  <strong>📝 Exam Insight:</strong> If an exam scenario describes a high-performer whose quality has suddenly dropped, the answer almost always involves <strong>Active Listening</strong> or <strong>Support (S3)</strong> to identify personal or systemic issues, rather than micromanagement.
