# 3.2 Servant Leadership, Coaching & Mentoring

**ECO Task**: Mentor relevant stakeholders
**ECO Task**: Support team performance

In 2026, the era of "Command & Control" is dead. Success is driven by the **Servant Leader**—the one who carries food and water for the team.

##  The Servant Leader Mindset
Your job is to remove rocks from the road, not to crack the whip.

| The Old Way (Manager)   | The New Way (Servant)       |
| :---------------------- | :-------------------------- |
| **"Why is this late?"** | **"What is blocking you?"** |
| Focus on Output/Tasks   | Focus on Outcome/Value      |
| Controls Information    | Radiates Information        |
| Taking Credit           | Giving Credit               |
| Tells people what to do | Asks what people need       |
| Measures hours          | Measures outcomes           |

::: tip  2026 Focus: Impediment Removal
Your most critical daily action is neutralizing **Impediments**. If you aren't clearing the path, you aren't leading.

##  Situational Leadership II (SLII) Deep Dive
You cannot treat every team member the same. You must adapt your style to their **Development Level** on each specific task.

<ConceptGrid>
  <ConceptCard title="S1: Directing">
    **High Direction / Low Support**
    For **D1** (Low Skill, High Will). Tell them exactly **what** to do and **how**.
  </ConceptCard>
  <ConceptCard title="S2: Coaching">
    **High Direction / High Support**
    For **D2** (Some Skill, Low Will). Explain **why** and encourage them through failure.
  </ConceptCard>
  <ConceptCard title="S3: Supporting">
    **Low Direction / High Support**
    For **D3** (High Skill, Variable Will). Don't tell them how; ask "How can I help?"
  </ConceptCard>
  <ConceptCard title="S4: Delegating">
    **Low Direction / Low Support**
    For **D4** (High Skill, High Will). Give them the goal and get out of the way.
  </ConceptCard>
</ConceptGrid>

::: tip  Exam Pattern: Support beats replacement
If a team member is willing but struggling, the best answer is usually coaching/training (not reassigning the work or escalating immediately).

## ‍ Coaching vs. Mentoring vs. Training
These concepts are often mixed up. The exam expects you to choose the right tool.

  </ConceptCard>
  <ConceptCard title="Mentoring">
    Long-term growth and wisdom. Focuses on career development and org navigation.
  </ConceptCard>
  <ConceptCard title="Training">
    Build specific knowledge. Event-based (e.g., new tools or methods).
  </ConceptCard>
  <ConceptCard title="Sponsoring">
    Opening doors and advocating for advancement at senior levels.
  </ConceptCard>
</ConceptGrid>

##  Influence Without Authority
PMs often lead in matrix environments without "command" authority. Success depends on influence.

  { 
    front: 'Expert Power', 
    back: 'Credibility from knowledge and competence. Ethical and highly effective.' 
  },
  { 
    front: 'Referent Power', 
    back: 'Based on trust and relationships. Ethical and excellent for long-term influence.' 
  },
  { 
    front: 'Legitimate Power', 
    back: 'Authority granted by formal role or position. Neutral effectiveness.' 
  },
  { 
    front: 'Coercive Power', 
    back: 'Threat/punishment. Avoid on exam; it damages trust and psychological safety.' 
  }
]" />

##  Emotional Intelligence (EQ)
EQ is the "secret sauce" of leading through crisis. You need all five Goleman competencies:

  }
]" />

::: tip  Exam Insight
If a high performer suddenly starts missing deadlines, do NOT micromanage (S1). Switch to **Supporting (S3)**. Ask open-ended questions to find out if they are burned out or facing personal issues. Your first move is **empathy and inquiry**, not direction.
