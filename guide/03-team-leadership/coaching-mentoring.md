## 🛡️ The Servant Leader Mindset
The primary goal of a Servant Leader is to **remove obstacles** so the team can perform at their highest potential.

| Traditional Manager                      | Servant Leader                                  |
| :--------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------- |
| Focuses on control and reporting.        | Focuses on **empowerment** and service.         |
| Asks: "Why are you late with this task?" | Asks: "What is blocking you from finishing?"    |
| Gives credit to themselves.              | Gives credit to the team.                       |
| Shields themselves.                      | **Shields the team** from organizational noise. |

::: info 🛠️ 2026 Focus: Removing Blockers
As a Servant Leader, your most important daily task is to identify and kill **Impediments, Obstacles, and Blockers**. If you aren't clearing the path, you aren't leading.

## 🧭 Situational Leadership
No single leadership style works for every person. You must adapt based on the **Follower's Readiness** (Skill + Will).

## 🧠 Emotional Intelligence (EQ)
EQ is the secret sauce of project success. It consists of four quadrants:
1. **Self-Awareness**: Knowing your own emotional triggers.
2. **Self-Management**: Controlling your reaction to stress.
3. **Social Awareness (Empathy)**: Reading the "room" and sensing team fatigue.
4. **Relationship Management**: Influencing others and resolving conflict.

## 🎓 Coaching vs. Mentoring
While often used interchangeably, they serve different purposes:

- **Coaching**: Short-term and **task-focused**. Example: Helping a developer master a new AI tool.
- **Mentoring**: Long-term and **career-focused**. Example: Advising a junior PM on their long-term professional journey.

  <strong>📝 Exam Insight:</strong> If an exam scenario asks how a PM should handle a high-performing team member who is suddenly underperforming, the answer usually involves <strong>Coaching (S2)</strong> or <strong>Active Listening</strong> to find the root cause of the "will" drop, rather than micromanaging.
