# 3.2 Servant Leadership & Style

In 2026, the era of "Command & Control" is dead. Success is driven by the **Servant Leader**—the one who carries food and water for the team.

## 🛡️ The Servant Leader Mindset
Your job is to remove rocks from the road, not to crack the whip.

| The Old Way (Manager)   | The New Way (Servant)       |
| :---------------------- | :-------------------------- |
| **"Why is this late?"** | **"What is blocking you?"** |
| Focus on Output/Tasks   | Focus on Outcome/Value      |
| Controls Information    | Radiates Information        |
| Taking Credit           | Giving Credit               |

::: tip 💡 2026 Focus: Impediment Removal
Your most critical daily action is neutralizing **Impediments**. If you aren't clearing the path, you aren't leading.

## 🧰 Servant Leadership in Practice (The Daily Behaviors)
Servant leadership is not "being nice." It is a high-discipline leadership system.

*   **Remove blockers**: dependencies, access issues, tool friction, unclear priorities.
*   **Create clarity**: goals, acceptance criteria, decision rights, and constraints.
*   **Protect focus**: prevent random work, interruptions, and stakeholder "scope sneak."
*   **Grow people**: coaching, mentoring, and creating learning opportunities.
*   **Model transparency**: communicate risks early and keep work visible.

## 🧭 Situational Leadership (SLII)
You cannot treat every team member the same. You must adapt to their readiness.

## 🧑‍🏫 Coaching vs. Mentoring vs. Training
These concepts are often mixed up in real life. The exam expects you to choose the right tool.

| Mode | Primary goal | Best for | What you do |
| :--- | :----------- | :------- | :---------- |
| **Coaching** | Improve performance on current work | Skill gap, low confidence, unclear approach | Ask questions, guide, remove obstacles |
| **Mentoring** | Long-term growth and judgment | Career development, organizational navigation | Connect to an experienced mentor |
| **Training** | Build knowledge/skills | New tools, methods, or domain learning | Arrange training and practice opportunities |

::: tip ✅ Exam Pattern: Support beats replacement
If a team member is willing but struggling, the best answer is usually coaching/training (not reassigning the work or escalating immediately).

  <div class="style-card s-lazy">
    <div class="style-head">Laissez-Faire</div>

  </div>
  <div class="style-card s-trans">
    <div class="style-head">Transactional</div>
    <p>"Do X, get Y." Management by exception. Focuses on goals, rewards, and penalties.</p>

## 🧲 Influence Without Authority (Power on the PMP Exam)
Project managers often lead in matrix environments where they cannot "command" resources.

*   **Expert power**: credibility from knowledge and competence (high-value, ethical).
*   **Referent power**: influence through trust and relationships (servant leadership fuel).
*   **Legitimate power**: authority granted by role (limited in many orgs).
*   **Reward power**: ability to give benefits (often indirect for PMs).
*   **Coercive power**: threat/punishment (use rarely; damages trust; usually a trap answer).

---

## 🧠 Emotional Intelligence (EQ)
EQ is the "secret sauce" of leading through crisis.
*   **Self-Awareness**: "I am angry right now." (Recognizing triggers).
*   **Self-Management**: "I will take a breath before replying." (Controlling impulses).
*   **Social Awareness**: "The team looks exhausted." (Empathy).
*   **Relationship Management**: "Let's take a break and reset." (Influencing others).

## 🗣️ A PMP-Friendly Coaching Conversation (Fast Script)
Use this when performance drops, conflict rises, or morale is slipping.

1.  **Open**: "What is making this hard right now?"
2.  **Listen**: paraphrase and confirm understanding (do not jump to solutions).
3.  **Clarify**: agree on the desired outcome and the next smallest step.
4.  **Support**: remove impediments, offer options, or arrange training/mentoring.
5.  **Follow up**: schedule a check-in and recognize progress.
