# 3.2 Servant Leadership, Coaching & Mentoring

**ECO Task**: Mentor relevant stakeholders
**ECO Task**: Support team performance

In 2026, the era of "Command & Control" is dead. Success is driven by the **Servant Leader**—the one who carries food and water for the team.

## 🛡️ The Servant Leader Mindset
Your job is to remove rocks from the road, not to crack the whip.

| The Old Way (Manager)   | The New Way (Servant)       |
| :---------------------- | :-------------------------- |
| **"Why is this late?"** | **"What is blocking you?"** |
| Focus on Output/Tasks   | Focus on Outcome/Value      |
| Controls Information    | Radiates Information        |
| Taking Credit           | Giving Credit               |
| Tells people what to do | Asks what people need       |
| Measures hours          | Measures outcomes           |

::: tip 💡 2026 Focus: Impediment Removal
Your most critical daily action is neutralizing **Impediments**. If you aren't clearing the path, you aren't leading.

## 🧰 Servant Leadership in Practice (The Daily Behaviors)
Servant leadership is not "being nice." It is a high-discipline leadership system that requires active effort.

### The Five Daily Practices
1. **Remove blockers**: Dependencies, access issues, tool friction, unclear priorities
2. **Create clarity**: Goals, acceptance criteria, decision rights, and constraints
3. **Protect focus**: Prevent random work, interruptions, and stakeholder "scope sneak"
4. **Grow people**: Coaching, mentoring, and creating learning opportunities
5. **Model transparency**: Communicate risks early and keep work visible

### Servant Leadership Self-Assessment
Rate yourself 1-5 on each behavior:
- [ ] I ask "What do you need?" more than I tell
- [ ] I resolve blockers the same day they're raised
- [ ] I give credit publicly and take blame privately
- [ ] I invest in my team's career growth, not just task completion
- [ ] I make decisions transparent, including the rationale

## 🧭 Situational Leadership II (SLII) Deep Dive
You cannot treat every team member the same. You must adapt your style to their **Development Level** on each specific task.

<div class="style-grid">
  <div class="style-card s1">
    <div class="style-head">S1: Directing</div>
    <div class="style-tag">High Direction / Low Support</div>
    <p><strong>For D1:</strong> Low Skill, High Will (Enthusiastic Beginner). Tell them exactly <strong>what</strong> to do and <strong>how</strong>.</p>
    <p><em>Example: Day 1 new hire on their first task.</em></p>
  </div>
  <div class="style-card s2">
    <div class="style-head">S2: Coaching</div>
    <div class="style-tag">High Direction / High Support</div>
    <p><strong>For D2:</strong> Some Skill, Low Will (Disillusioned Learner). Explain <strong>why</strong> and encourage them through failure.</p>
    <p><em>Example: New team member frustrated by initial struggles.</em></p>
  </div>
  <div class="style-card s3">
    <div class="style-head">S3: Supporting</div>
    <div class="style-tag">Low Direction / High Support</div>
    <p><strong>For D3:</strong> High Skill, Variable Will (Capable but Cautious). Don't tell them how; ask "How can I help?"</p>
    <p><em>Example: Experienced person taking on a new type of work.</em></p>
  </div>
  <div class="style-card s4">
    <div class="style-head">S4: Delegating</div>
    <div class="style-tag">Low Direction / Low Support</div>
    <p><strong>For D4:</strong> High Skill, High Will (Self-Reliant Achiever). Give them the goal and get out of the way.</p>
    <p><em>Example: Your senior expert handling their specialty.</em></p>
  </div>
</div>

### Matching Style to Development Level
| Development Level | Characteristics | Leader Actions |
| :---------------- | :-------------- | :------------- |
| **D1** | Eager but lacking skill | Provide clear steps; close supervision; frequent check-ins |
| **D2** | Some skill but frustrated | Explain reasoning; offer encouragement; acknowledge difficulty |
| **D3** | Capable but uncertain | Ask questions; collaborate on decisions; build confidence |
| **D4** | Skilled and confident | Delegate fully; provide resources; stay available |

### Common SLII Mistakes
| Mistake | Impact | Correction |
| :------ | :----- | :--------- |
| **Directing a D4** | Micromanagement; demotivation | Trust and delegate |
| **Delegating to a D1** | Failure; frustration | Provide structure and guidance |
| **Same style for everyone** | Mismatched support | Assess each person per task |
| **Never updating style** | Stagnation | Reassess as people grow |

::: tip ✅ Exam Pattern: Support beats replacement
If a team member is willing but struggling, the best answer is usually coaching/training (not reassigning the work or escalating immediately).

## 🧑‍🏫 Coaching vs. Mentoring vs. Training vs. Sponsoring
These concepts are often mixed up in real life. The exam expects you to choose the right tool.

| Mode | Primary Goal | Duration | Relationship | Best For |
| :--- | :----------- | :------- | :----------- | :------- |
| **Coaching** | Improve performance on current work | Short-term | PM/lead to team member | Skill gap, low confidence, unclear approach |
| **Mentoring** | Long-term growth and wisdom | Long-term | Experienced person to protégé | Career development, organizational navigation |
| **Training** | Build specific knowledge/skills | Event-based | Trainer to learner | New tools, methods, or domain learning |
| **Sponsoring** | Open doors, advocate for advancement | Ongoing | Senior leader to high-potential | Promotions, visibility, stretch opportunities |

### The GROW Coaching Model
A structured framework for coaching conversations:

| Step | Question Focus | Example Questions |
| :--- | :------------- | :---------------- |
| **G - Goal** | What do you want to achieve? | "What does success look like?" |
| **R - Reality** | Where are you now? | "What's getting in the way?" |
| **O - Options** | What could you do? | "What have you tried? What else?" |
| **W - Will** | What will you do? | "What's your next step? When?" |

### Coaching Best Practices
- **Ask more than tell**: The person being coached should talk more than you
- **Listen deeply**: Paraphrase and confirm understanding
- **Focus on behavior, not identity**: "The code had bugs" not "You're careless"
- **Follow up**: Schedule check-ins to track progress

## 🧲 Influence Without Authority: Power in the Matrix
Project managers often lead in matrix environments where they cannot "command" resources. Success depends on influence.

### The Five Types of Power
| Power Type | Source | Effectiveness | Ethics |
| :--------- | :----- | :------------ | :----- |
| **Expert** | Credibility from knowledge and competence | High | Ethical |
| **Referent** | Trust and relationships | High | Ethical |
| **Legitimate** | Authority granted by role | Medium | Neutral |
| **Reward** | Ability to give benefits | Medium | Use carefully |
| **Coercive** | Threat/punishment | Low | Avoid; damages trust |

### Building Expert Power
- Develop deep knowledge in your domain
- Share insights that help others
- Admit when you don't know and learn
- Build a track record of good decisions

### Building Referent Power
- Be trustworthy and consistent
- Follow through on commitments
- Show genuine interest in others
- Be fair and transparent

::: warning ⚠️ Exam Trap: Coercive Power
Coercive power (threats, punishment) is almost always a trap answer on the PMP exam. Servant leaders use expert and referent power instead.

## 🧠 Emotional Intelligence (EQ): The Complete Model
EQ is the "secret sauce" of leading through crisis. Based on Goleman's model, you need all five competencies:

### The Five EQ Competencies
| Competency | Description | PM Application |
| :--------- | :---------- | :------------- |
| **Self-Awareness** | Recognizing your own emotions and triggers | "I am angry right now—I should pause before responding." |
| **Self-Regulation** | Controlling impulses and reactions | "I will take a breath and choose a constructive response." |
| **Motivation** | Inner drive beyond external rewards | "I care about this project's success, not just my bonus." |
| **Empathy** | Understanding others' emotions | "The team looks exhausted—we may need to reduce scope." |
| **Social Skills** | Building rapport and influencing | "Let's take a break and reset—I can see we're stuck." |

### The EQ Ladder in Action
1. **Self-Awareness**: Notice your emotional state
2. **Self-Regulation**: Manage your response
3. **Empathy**: Read others' emotional states
4. **Social Skills**: Respond in a way that builds trust

### EQ Development Practices
- **Journaling**: Reflect on emotional reactions after difficult situations
- **Feedback seeking**: Ask trusted colleagues how you come across
- **Pause practice**: Build the habit of waiting before responding
- **Active listening**: Focus on understanding before being understood

## 🎓 Training Needs Analysis (Gap Analysis)
Before you send someone to training, you must verify the gap.

### The Four-Step Process
1. **Observation**: Watch them work. Are they struggling with the tool or the process?
2. **Surveys/Interviews**: Ask the team, "What skills are we missing?"
3. **Performance Reviews**: Check past data.
4. **Gap Analysis**: Compare current skills (Skills Matrix) vs. required skills.

### The Solution Isn't Always Training
| Gap Type | Root Cause | Solution |
| :------- | :--------- | :------- |
| **Knowledge** | Don't know what to do | Training |
| **Skill** | Know what, but can't execute | Coaching/Practice |
| **Will** | Can do it, but won't | Motivate/Counsel |
| **Environment** | Would, but can't | Remove Blockers |

::: tip 💡 Exam Pattern: Diagnose Before Prescribing
The best answers usually diagnose the root cause (skill vs. will vs. environment) before jumping to training or discipline.

## 🗣️ A PMP-Friendly Coaching Conversation (Fast Script)
Use this when performance drops, conflict rises, or morale is slipping.

### The Five-Step Script
1. **Open**: "What is making this hard right now?"
2. **Listen**: Paraphrase and confirm understanding (do not jump to solutions)
3. **Clarify**: Agree on the desired outcome and the next smallest step
4. **Support**: Remove impediments, offer options, or arrange training/mentoring
5. **Follow up**: Schedule a check-in and recognize progress

### Feedback Model: SBI (Situation–Behavior–Impact)
A structured way to give clear, actionable feedback:

| Component | What It Means | Example |
| :-------- | :------------ | :------ |
| **Situation** | When/where | "In yesterday's demo..." |
| **Behavior** | Observable action | "...you interrupted two teammates..." |
| **Impact** | Effect on others/work | "...and it shut down discussion." |
| **Request** | What to do differently | "Can we try a hand-raise rule?" |

### Feedback Best Practices
- **Timely**: Give feedback as close to the event as possible
- **Specific**: Focus on observable behavior, not personality
- **Balanced**: Acknowledge what's working, not just problems
- **Private**: Deliver critical feedback 1-on-1, not publicly

  <strong>📝 Exam Insight:</strong> If a high performer suddenly starts missing deadlines, do NOT micromanage (S1). Switch to <strong>Supporting (S3)</strong>. Ask open-ended questions to find out if they are burned out or facing personal issues. Your first move is <strong>empathy and inquiry</strong>, not direction.
