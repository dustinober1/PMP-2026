##  Governance Structures

### Card 1
**Front:**
What is **Project Governance**?

**Back:**
The framework, functions, and processes that guide project management activities in order to create a unique product, service, or result to meet organizational, strategic, and operational goals. (The "Rules of the Road").

### Card 2
**Front:**
What is the difference between **Governance** and **Management**?

**Back:**
-   **Governance**: Oversight, Strategic Direction, "doing the right things" (Steering Committee).
-   **Management**: Execution, Day-to-Day Operations, "doing things right" (Project Manager).

### Card 3
**Front:**
What is a **Steering Committee**?

**Back:**
A governance body of key stakeholders (Sponsor, Execs) that provides strategic direction, resolves escalated issues, and makes "Go/No-Go" decisions.

### Card 4
**Front:**
What is the **Sponsor's** primary governance role?

**Back:**
Providing funding (resources), championing the project, and acting as the final escalation point for issues the PM cannot resolve.

### Card 5
**Front:**
What is the **Change Control Board (CCB)**?

**Back:**
A formally chartered group responsible for reviewing, evaluating, approving, delaying, or rejecting changes to the project baselines.

### Card 6
**Front:**
**Scenario**: You need a template for a Project Charter. Who do you contact?

**Back:**
The **Project Management Office (PMO)**.

### Card 7
**Front:**
**Scenario**: You need more budget (Funding) because costs increased. Who do you contact?

**Back:**
The **Sponsor** (or Steering Committee). The PMO cannot grant budget.

### Card 8
**Front:**
**Scenario**: A new law is passed that makes your product illegal. Who decides whether to cancel the project?

**Back:**
**Governance** (Steering Committee / Sponsor). The PM provides the impact analysis, but Governance makes the "Kill" decision.

### Card 9
**Front:**
What is a **Phase Gate** (Kill Point)?

**Back:**
A review at the end of a phase in which a decision is made to continue to the next phase, to continue with modification, or to end a project or program.

### Card 10
**Front:**
What is **Organizational Project Management (OPM)**?

**Back:**
A strategy execution framework utilizing project, program, and portfolio management as well as organizational enablers (e.g., PMO) to consistently deliver better performance/results.

---

##  The PMO (Project Management Office)

### Card 11
**Front:**
What is a **Supportive PMO**?

**Back:**
A PMO that provides a consultative role by supplying templates, best practices, training, access to information, and lessons learned. **Level of Control: Low**.

### Card 12
**Front:**
What is a **Controlling PMO**?

**Back:**
A PMO that provides support and requires compliance through various means (frameworks, methodologies, templates, tools). **Level of Control: Moderate**.

### Card 13
**Front:**
What is a **Directive PMO**?

**Back:**
A PMO that takes control of the projects by directly managing them. Project Managers report to the PMO. **Level of Control: High**.

### Card 14
**Front:**
**Scenario**: Your PMO Director assigns you to a project and you report directly to them. What type of PMO is this?

**Back:**
**Directive PMO**.

### Card 15
**Front:**
**Scenario**: The PMO provides you with a Risk Register template but lets you choose your own methodology. What type of PMO is this?

**Supportive PMO**.

### Card 16
**Front:**
**Scenario**: The PMO audits your project to ensure you are following the standard 5-step risk process. What type of PMO is this?

**Back:**
**Controlling PMO**.

### Card 17
**Front:**
What is the modern, value-driven view of a PMO?

**Back:**
It is a "Servant Leader" service center that enables delivery, focuses on strategic alignment, and optimizes resources (vs. the old "Police Force" view).

### Card 18
**Front:**
Does the PMO manage the project budget?

**Back:**
Usually **No**. The PMO tracks/reports on it, but the *Sponsor* owns the budget and the *PM* manages it. (Exception: Directive PMO might own the budget).

### Card 19
**Front:**
How does a PMO support **Knowledge Management**?

**Back:**
By maintaining the repository of Lessons Learned (OPAs) from past projects so new teams don't repeat mistakes.

### Card 20

The **PMO** (and Portfolio Management).

4. **Guidelines** (Optional recommendations).

### Card 22
**Front:**
**Scenario**: A stakeholder asks you to skip a safety inspection to save time. It is required by OSHA (Law). What do you do?

**Back:**
**Refuse**. Laws and safety regulations are non-negotiable. "Safety > Schedule".

### Card 23
**Front:**
**Scenario**: A new regulation (GDPR) is passed mid-project. It requires a major scope change. What do you do?

### Card 28
**Front:**
**Scenario**: You discover your project is violating an environmental law. The fix will kill the project budget. What do you do?

**Back:**
**Disclose it** to your employer and **Recuse yourself** from the decision-making process.

### Card 34

##  Agile Governance

### Card 41
**Front:**
How does Governance differ in Agile vs. Waterfall?

**Back:**
-   **Waterfall**: Heavy upfront planning, formal Phase Gates, rigorous documentation reviews to proceed.
-   **Agile**: Iterative, empirical control (reviewing working software), decentralized decision making.

### Card 42
**Front:**
What replaces "Phase Gates" in Agile?

**Back:**
**Sprint Reviews** (System Demos) and Retrospectives. If the increment isn't acceptable, we adapt immediately.

### Card 43
**Front:**
Who provides governance on the "product value" in Agile?

**Back:**
The **Product Owner**. They decide what gets built and in what order.

### Card 44

How do you track compliance in Agile?

**Back:**
Add compliance items to the **Backlog** or as part of the **Definition of Done** (DoD).

Yes, often an **Agile PMO** or "Center of Excellence" that provides coaching, tools, and aggregated reporting, but less command-and-control.

### Card 50
**Front:**
**Scenario**: The Agile team wants to change the Sprint length. Who decides?

**Back:**
The **Team** decides their own process (usually).

**Legal / Compliance** department (or a Subject Matter Expert).

### Card 60
**Front:**
What is the risk of **Poor Governance**?

**Back:**
Misalignment with strategy, lack of funding control, legal violations, and "Zombie Projects" (projects that should be killed but grind on).

---

##  Situational Governance

### Card 61
**Front:**
**Scenario**: A senior executive who is NOT the sponsor demands a change to the project. What is your governance response?

**Back:**
Direct them to the **Sponsor** or the **Change Control Process**. Do not just say "yes" because of their title; you must protect the approved plan.

### Card 62
**Front:**
**Scenario**: Your project involves personal data from EU citizens. You didn't budget for GDPR activities.

**Back:**
Issue a **Change Request** for budget/schedule. You cannot launch without compliance.

### Card 63
**Front:**
**Scenario**: A safety inspector shuts down your valid construction site. You think they are wrong.

**Back:**
**Compliance First**. Stop work. Then follow the formal appeals process. Do not ignore the order.

### Card 64
**Front:**
**Scenario**: The Sponsor refuses to sign the Charter.

**Back:**
You **cannot start** the project (planning/execution). The Charter authorizes the project. Without it, you are a "rogue" project.

### Card 65
**Front:**
**Scenario**: The PMO requires a specific "Status Report" format that adds no value to your Agile team.

**Back:**
**Negotiate/Tailor**. Ask the PMO *why* they need it (what info they need) and see if your Agile charts (Burnups) can satisfy the need. But if mandatory, you do it.

### Card 66
**Front:**
**Scenario**: You discover a conflict between two internal policies.

**Back:**
Escalate to **Governance** (PMO or Sponsor) for a decision on which policy takes precedence.

### Card 67
**Front:**
**Scenario**: You are a PMP. Your boss tells you to lie to a client.

**Back:**
**Refuse**. It violates the "Honesty" and "Responsibility" clauses of the Code of Ethics.

### Card 68
**Front:**
**Scenario**: You see a potential copyright violation on another project. Is it your business?

**Back:**
**Yes**. "Responsibility" means we protect the profession and organization. Report it.

### Card 69
**Front:**
What is **Escalation**?

**Back:**
Moving an issue up the governance chain (Team -> PM -> Sponsor -> Steering Committee) when it exceeds your authority to solve.

### Card 70
**Front:**
Why is **Role Clarity** part of governance?

**Back:**
Because if people don't know who decides what (RACI), decisions stall and accountability fails.
