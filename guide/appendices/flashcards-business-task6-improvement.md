## 🏛️ Quality Assurance vs Control

### Card 21
**Front:**
What is the difference between **QA** and **QC**?

**Back:**
-   **QA (Manage Quality)**: Managing the **Process** (Prevention).
-   **QC (Control Quality)**: Checking the **Product** (Inspection).

### Card 22
**Front:**
**Scenario**: You are auditing the team's adherence to the Safety Procedure. Is this QA or QC?

**Back:**
**QA**. You are checking the process.

### Card 23
**Front:**
**Scenario**: You are testing the software code for bugs. Is this QA or QC?

**Back:**
**QC**. You are checking the product.

### Card 24
**Front:**
**Scenario**: "Continuous Improvement" belongs to which Process Group?

**Back:**
**Executing** (Manage Quality).

### Card 25
**Front:**
What is a **Quality Audit**?

**Back:**
A structured review to determine if project activities comply with organizational and project policies/procedures.

### Card 26
**Front:**
What acts as the baseline for improvement?

**Back:**
**Metrics** (KPIs). You cannot improve what you do not measure.

### Card 27
**Front:**
**Scenario**: The team learns a new, faster way to code during the project. What should they do?

**Back:**
Update the **OPAs** (Organizational Process Assets) and share it (Knowledge Management).

### Card 28

**Back:**
Sort, Set in order, Shine, Standardize, Sustain. A methodology for workplace organization.

## 🧠 Situational Improvement

### Card 31
**Front:**
**Scenario**: A process is "In Control" but produces defects (doesn't meet spec).

**Back:**
The process is **Stable but not Capable**. You need to improve the process (QA), not just fix the outliers.

### Card 32
**Front:**
**Scenario**: The Retrospective turns into a "blame game."

**Back:**
The facilitator needs to re-focus on **Process** not People. Use data. Ensure Psychological Safety.

### Card 33
**Front:**
**Scenario**: Improve a process that you don't understand?

**Back:**
Impossible. Use a **Flowchart** or GEMBA walk (go see) to understand the "As-Is" state first.

### Card 34
**Front:**
**Scenario**: "Analysis Paralysis" in improvement?

**Back:**
Don't wait for perfect data. Use **PDCA**. Try a small change, check result, adjust.

### Card 35

**Scenario**: A stakeholder suggests a change to improve efficiency.

**Back:**
Evaluate it. Calculate ROI. If good, implement via Change Control (if needed) or continuous improvement loops.

### Card 36
**Front:**
**True or False**: Lessons Learned are only done at the end of the project.

**Back:**
**False**. They should be continuous (Retrospectives).

### Card 37

**Back:**
The process is broken. **Improve it** (Streamline). Do not force compliance to a bad process.
