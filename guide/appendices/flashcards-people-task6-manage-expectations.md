## The Control Loop: Data to Decisions

### Card 1
**Front**: What is the primary purpose of "Managing Stakeholder Expectations" during execution?
**Back**: To ensure that what the project delivers matches what the stakeholders *think* it will deliver, reducing the risk of rejection.
**Domain**: People | **Task**: Manage stakeholder expectations

### Card 2
**Front**: What is the "Control Funnel" sequence for reporting?
**Back**: Work Performance **Data** (Raw) → Work Performance **Information** (Analyzed) → Work Performance **Reports** (Formatted).
**Domain**: People | **Task**: Manage stakeholder expectations

### Card 3
**Front**: A stakeholder is confused by your status report because it lists "500 bugs found." What went wrong?
**Back**: You sent **Data**, not **Information**. You failed to analyze the context (e.g., "is this normal?").
**Domain**: People | **Task**: Manage stakeholder expectations

### Card 4
**Front**: What is "Work Performance Information" (WPI)?
**Back**: The integrated analysis of WPD (e.g., "CPI is 0.8, meaning we are over budget").
**Domain**: People | **Task**: Manage stakeholder expectations

### Card 5
**Front**: Status Reports, Dashboards, and Memos are examples of...
**Back**: **Work Performance Reports** (WPR).
**Domain**: People | **Task**: Manage stakeholder expectations

### Card 6
**Front**: If a stakeholder is surprised by a delay, what communication principal failed?
**Back**: The "No Surprises" rule. Variances should be communicated as soon as they are analyzed, not hidden until the report.
**Domain**: People | **Task**: Manage stakeholder expectations

### Card 7
**Front**: What is the best way to correct a stakeholder's unrealistic expectation of a completion date?
**Back**: Use **Data** (Evidence). Show the Trend Analysis or Schedule Forecast, not just your opinion.
**Domain**: People | **Task**: Manage stakeholder expectations

### Card 8
**Front**: Define "Management by Exception".
**Back**: Only notifying higher management when a variance exceeds a pre-defined **threshold** (e.g., >10% over budget).
**Domain**: People | **Task**: Manage stakeholder expectations

---

## Measuring Performance (EVM) for Expectations

### Card 9
**Front**: If CPI = 0.85, what does this tell the stakeholder?
**Back**: "For every $1.00 you spent, you only got $0.85 of value." (We are over budget).
**Domain**: People | **Task**: Manage stakeholder expectations

### Card 10
**Front**: If SPI = 1.15, what does this tell the stakeholder?
**Back**: "We are progressing at 115% of the planned rate." (Ahead of schedule).
**Domain**: People | **Task**: Manage stakeholder expectations

### Card 11
**Front**: Is a CPI > 1.0 always good?
**Back**: Usually yes (under budget), but if it's very high (e.g., 1.5), it might mean you are cutting corners or missing scope (Gold plating in reverse).
**Domain**: People | **Task**: Manage stakeholder expectations

### Card 12
**Front**: Which EVM metric predicts the *future* final cost of the project?
**Back**: **EAC** (Estimate at Completion).
**Domain**: People | **Task**: Manage stakeholder expectations

### Card 13
**Front**: If stakeholders ask "How much *more* money do you need to finish?", which metric do you use?
**Back**: **ETC** (Estimate to Complete).
**Domain**: People | **Task**: Manage stakeholder expectations

### Card 14
**Front**: If stakeholders ask "Will we look bad at the end?", which metric answers this?
**Back**: **VAC** (Variance at Completion). It shows the projected over/under run at the very end.
**Domain**: People | **Task**: Manage stakeholder expectations

### Card 15
**Front**: What is the **TCPI** (To-Complete Performance Index)?
**Back**: A measure of how efficiently the team must work *from now on* to meet the budget. High TCPI (>1.1) is hard to sustain.
**Domain**: People | **Task**: Manage stakeholder expectations

### Card 16
**Front**: Why is "Trend Analysis" superior to a single status report?
**Back**: A single point can be an anomaly. A **Trend** (e.g., CPI dropping for 3 months) shows the direction of the project health.
**Domain**: People | **Task**: Manage stakeholder expectations

### Card 17
**Front**: What is a "Variance Analysis"?
**Back**: Comparing Actuals (What happened) vs. Baseline (What we planned).
**Domain**: People | **Task**: Manage stakeholder expectations

### Card 18
**Front**: The project is Green, but the Customer is unhappy. Why?
**Back**: You are measuring "Project Success" (Cost/Schedule) but failing "Product Success" (Benefits/Value). Align on Outcomes, not Outputs.
**Domain**: People | **Task**: Manage stakeholder expectations

---

## Agile Monitoring & Expectations

### Card 19
**Front**: In Agile, do we track variance against a Scope Baseline?
**Back**: No. We track **Value Delivery** and **Flow** against the Product Vision and Goals.
**Domain**: People | **Task**: Manage stakeholder expectations

### Card 20
**Front**: What does a "Burnup Chart" show that a Burndown chart doesn't?
**Back**: It shows the **Total Scope** line. If that line moves up, stakeholders can clearly see that "Scope Creep" is pushing the date out.
**Domain**: People | **Task**: Manage stakeholder expectations

### Card 21
**Front**: A stakeholder complains that Velocity varies from 20 to 50 every Sprint.
**Back**: This is "Unstable Velocity." Expectations cannot be managed until velocity stabilizes. Investigate team capacity or story sizing.
**Domain**: People | **Task**: Manage stakeholder expectations

### Card 22
**Front**: What is "Cycle Time"?
**Back**: The time it takes to complete a work item once started. (Good for setting speed expectations).
**Domain**: People | **Task**: Manage stakeholder expectations

**Front**: What is "Lead Time"?
**Back**: The time from the *customer request* until delivery. (This is the metric stakeholders care about most).
**Domain**: People | **Task**: Manage stakeholder expectations

**Back**: To visualize flow and identify bottlenecks (widening bands) in the process.
**Domain**: People | **Task**: Manage stakeholder expectations

### Card 26
**Front**: How do "Information Radiators" help manage expectations?
**Back**: By making status continuously visible (Transparency). Stakeholders don't need to ask "Where are we?"; they can just look.
**Domain**: People | **Task**: Manage stakeholder expectations

### Card 27
**Front**: What is the "Daily Standup" *not* for?
**Back**: It is NOT a status report to the PM/Stakeholders. It is a planning meeting for the *Team*.
**Domain**: People | **Task**: Manage stakeholder expectations

### Card 34
**Front**: Can the Project Manager approve a change?
**Back**: Only if it is within their delegated authority (e.g., "Changes under $500" or "Changes that don't impact the baseline").
**Domain**: People | **Task**: Manage stakeholder expectations

### Card 35
**Front**: A change is approved. What is the FIRST thing you do?
**Back**: Update the **Baselines** and Project Documents. (Then implement it).
**Domain**: People | **Task**: Manage stakeholder expectations

### Card 37
**Front**: What happens if you skip Integrated Change Control?

**Domain**: People | **Task**: Manage stakeholder expectations
