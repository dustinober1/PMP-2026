##  Risk Management Basics

### Card 1
**Front:**
What is the definition of **Project Risk**?

**Back:**
An uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on one or more project objectives.

### Card 2
**Front:**
What is a **Positive Risk** called?

**Back:**
An **Opportunity**.

### Card 3
**Front:**
What is a **Negative Risk** called?

**Back:**
A **Threat**.

### Card 4
**Front:**
What is **Risk Appetite**?

**Back:**
The degree of uncertainty an organization or individual is willing to accept in anticipation of a reward.

### Card 5
**Front:**
What is a **Risk Threshold**?

**Back:**
a clear limit beyond which the organization will not accept the risk (e.g., "Any risk over $10k must be mitigated").

### Card 6
**Front:**
What is **Risk Tolerance**?

**Back:**
The specified range of acceptable results (e.g., +/- 10% of budget).

### Card 7
**Front:**
What is the **Risk Breakdown Structure (RBS)**?

**Back:**
A hierarchical representation of potential sources of risk (categorized by Technical, External, Management, etc.). It helps identify blind spots.

### Card 8
**Front:**
**Scenario**: You identify a risk that could impact the project significantly. What is the **First Step**?

**Back:**
**Document it** in the Risk Register. Then Analyze it.

### Card 9
**Front:**
What is the difference between **Qualitative** and **Quantitative** Risk Analysis?

**Back:**
-   **Qualitative**: Subjective ranking (High/Med/Low) for prioritization. Fast.
-   **Quantitative**: Numerical analysis (EMV, Monte Carlo) for cost/schedule targets. Slow.

### Card 10
**Front:**
What is **EMV** (Expected Monetary Value)?

**Back:**
Probability × Impact. (e.g., 50% chance of $100 loss = -$50 EMV).

##  Response Strategies (Threats)

### Card 11
**Front:**
What are the 5 strategies for **Threats**?

**Back:**
Escalate, Avoid, Transfer, Mitigate, Accept.

### Card 12
**Front:**
**Scenario**: The risk is critical, but you have no authority to manage it (e.g., Organization-wide freeze).

**Back:**
**Escalate**. (To the Sponsor/Portfolio).

### Card 13
**Front:**
**Scenario**: You change the project plan/scope to eliminate the threat entirely.

**Back:**
**Avoid**.

### Card 14
**Front:**
**Scenario**: You buy insurance or hire a vendor with a fixed-price contract.

**Back:**
**Transfer**. (Shift the liability).

### Card 15
**Front:**
**Scenario**: You take action to reduce the Probability or Impact (e.g., Prototype, Training).

**Back:**
**Mitigate**.

### Card 16
**Front:**
**Scenario**: The risk is low priority. You decide to do nothing active but handle it if it happens.

**Back:**
**Accept** (Passive). If you set aside money, it is **Active Acceptance** (Contingency).

---

##  Response Strategies (Opportunities)

### Card 17
**Front:**
What are the 5 strategies for **Opportunities**?

**Back:**
Escalate, Exploit, Share, Enhance, Accept.

### Card 18
**Front:**
**Scenario**: You want to ensure the opportunity definitely happens (eliminate uncertainty).

**Back:**
**Exploit**. (e.g., Assign top talent to finish early).

### Card 19
**Front:**
**Scenario**: You partner with another company to capture the value together.

**Back:**
**Share**. (e.g., Joint Venture).

### Card 20
**Front:**
**Scenario**: You take action to increase the Probability or Impact.

**Back:**
**Enhance**. (e.g., Add resources to try and finish early).

What allows you to address "Known-Unknowns"?

**Back:**
**Contingency Reserves**. (Included in the Cost Baseline).

### Card 22
**Front:**
What allows you to address "Unknown-Unknowns"?

**Back:**
**Management Reserves**. (NOT in the Cost Baseline, but in the Budget). Requires Change Request.

### Card 23
**Front:**
What is **Sensitivity Analysis**?

**Back:**
Determining which risks have the most potential impact on the project outcome (e.g., **Tornado Diagram**).

### Card 24
**Front:**
What is **Monte Carlo Simulation**?

**Back:**
A computerized technique that iterates thousands of times to produce a probability distribution (S-Curve) of possible cost or schedule outcomes.

### Card 25
**Front:**
What is a **Decision Tree Analysis**?

**Back:**
A diagramming and calculation technique for evaluating the implications of a chain of multiple options in the presence of uncertainty.

### Card 26
**Front:**
**Scenario**: A risk is 30% likely to cost $10,000. What is the EMV?

**Back:**
$3,000. (0.30 * 10,000).

### Card 27
**Front:**
What is a **Trigger Condition**?

**Back:**
An event or situation that indicates that a risk is about to occur (Warning Sign). Starts the response plan.

### Card 28
**Front:**
What is **Residual Risk**?

**Back:**
The risk expected to remain after the planned response of risk treatment has been taken.

### Card 29
**Front:**
What is **Secondary Risk**?

**Back:**
A risk that arises as a direct result of implementing a risk response.

### Card 30
**Front:**
What is a **Watch List**?

**Back:**
A list of low-priority risks that are monitored but have no active response plan.

##  Agile Risk Management

### Card 31
**Front:**
How does Agile manage risk?

**Back:**
Iteratively. Frequent delivery reduces risk. Retrospectives identify risks. Daily Standups identify blockers (risks).

### Card 32
**Front:**
What is a **Risk Burndown Chart**?

**Back:**
A chart showing the severity of project risk changing over time (Hopefully going down).

### Card 33
**Front:**
What is a **Spike**?

**Back:**
A short, time-boxed effort devoted to Research or Prototyping to reduce technical risk/uncertainty.

### Card 34
**Front:**
**Scenario**: A high-risk user story exists. Where should it go in the Backlog?

**Back:**
**Top**. Address high risks early ("Fail Fast").

### Card 35
**Front:**
What is **Risk-Adjusted Backlog**?

**Back:**
Prioritizing items not just by value, but by risk reduction value.

### Card 36
**Front:**
Who owns risk in Agile?

**Back:**
The **Entire Team**, though the Product Owner owns business risk and the Team owns technical risk.

### Card 37
**Front:**
**Scenario**: "Architectural Runway"?

**Back:**
Building code/infrastructure early to support future features and reduce technical risk (SAFe concept).

### Card 38
**Front:**
What is the "Minimum Viable Product" (MVP) role in risk?

**Back:**
It mitigates the risk of building the wrong product by validating assumptions with real users early.

### Card 39
**Front:**
**Scenario**: Team discovers a new risk during the Sprint.

**Back:**
Discuss in Daily Scrum. Add to Risk Register/Backlog.

### Card 40
**Front:**
**Scenario**: "Cone of Uncertainty"?

**Back:**
Uncertainty is highest at the beginning of the project and decreases as work is executed.

##  Situational Risk

### Card 41
**Front:**
**Scenario**: You find a risk that could kill the project (threatens project existence).

**Back:**
Prioritize it as critical. Communicate immediately. You might need to recommend project cancellation if it cannot be mitigated.

### Card 42
**Front:**
**Scenario**: A stakeholder says "I don't think that will happen."

**Back:**
Use **Data**. Or use **Delphi Technique** (anonymous consensus) to get unbiased expert opinion.

### Card 43
**Front:**
**Scenario**: You used all your Contingency Reserve.

**Back:**
If more risks happen, you must ask for **Management Reserve** (Change Request) or specific funding.

### Card 44
**Front:**
**Scenario**: A risk occurs that was NOT in the register.

**Back:**
**Workaround**. Handle the Issue. Then update the Risk Register (for future) and Lessons Learned.

### Card 45
**Front:**
**Scenario**: You buy insurance (Transfer), but the insurance company goes bankrupt.

**Back:**
**Secondary Risk**. You now have the original risk back plus a new issue.

### Card 46
**Front:**
**Scenario**: The cost of mitigating the risk is higher than the impact of the risk.

**Back:**
**Accept** the risk. (Don't spend $100 to save $50).

### Card 47
**Front:**
What is a **Risk Audit**?

**Back:**
Reviewing the effectiveness of the risk management *process* and the responses implemented.

### Card 48
**Front:**
**Scenario**: "Assumption Analysis"?

**Back:**
Validating if assumptions are still true. False assumptions = Risks.

### Card 49
**Front:**
**Scenario**: "SWOT Analysis"?

**Back:**
Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats. Used for Risk Identification.

### Card 50
**Front:**
**Scenario**: "Pre-Mortem"?

**Back:**
Team imagines the project *has already failed* and works backward to determine why. Great for identifying hidden risks.
