What are the two main categories of "Resources" in project management?

**Back:**
1.  **Team Resources** (Human: skills, people).
2.  **Physical Resources** (Material: equipment, materials, facilities, infrastructure).

### Card 2
**Front:**
What is a **Resource Breakdown Structure (RBS)**?

**Back:**
A hierarchical representation of resources by category and type. It helps in organizing and reporting on resource costs and utilization.

### Card 3
**Front:**
What is the key output of the **Plan Resource Management** process?

**Back:**
The **Resource Management Plan**. It defines how to categorize, allocate, manage, and release resources.

### Card 4
**Front:**
What is a **Resource Calendar**?

**Back:**
A calendar that identifies the working days, shifts, start/end dates, and holidays for specific resources (people or equipment).

### Card 5
**Front:**
What is the difference between a **RACI Chart** and a **RAM**?

**Back:**
A RACI chart is a specific type of **RAM (Responsibility Assignment Matrix)** that uses the roles Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed. RAM is the generic term.

### Card 6
**Front:**
In a RACI chart, what does **Accountable (A)** mean?

**Back:**
The person who is ultimately answerable for the correct and thorough completion of the deliverable or task. There must be **only one** "A" per task.

### Card 7
**Front:**
In a RACI chart, what does **Responsible (R)** mean?

**Back:**
The person who actually **does the work**. There can be multiple "R"s for a single task.

### Card 8
**Front:**
What is **Consulted (C)** in RACI?

**Back:**
Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) whose opinions are sought **before** and during the work. It implies two-way communication.

### Card 9
**Front:**
What is **Informed (I)** in RACI?

**Back:**
Stakeholders who are kept up-to-date on progress or completion, often **after** the fact. It implies one-way communication.

### Card 10
**Front:**
What is **Bottom-Up Estimating** for resources?

**Back:**
Estimating team/physical resources at the lowest level of the WBS (Work Packages) and aggregating them up to get the total project resource needs. It is the most accurate but time-consuming method.

## 📊 Resource Optimization

### Card 11
**Front:**
What is **Resource Leveling**?

**Back:**
A technique to resolve resource conflicts (over-allocations) by adjusting start/end dates. It **often extends the critical path** (changes the project end date).

### Card 12
**Front:**
What is **Resource Smoothing**?

### Card 16
**Front:**
What is a **Resource Histogram**?

**Back:**
A bar chart that shows the amount of time that a resource is scheduled to work over a series of time periods. It visually highlights over-allocation (peaks).

### Card 17
**Front:**
What is **Analogous Estimating**?

**Back:**
Using a previous, similar project as a basis for estimating the resources/duration of the current project. It is fast but less accurate (Gross value estimation).

### Card 18
**Front:**
What is **Parametric Estimating**?

**Back:**
Using a statistical relationship between historical data and other variables (e.g., sq. ft. of construction) to calculate resource needs (e.g., "We need 2 painters per 1,000 sq. ft.").

### Card 19
**Front:**
What is **Data Analysis** in resource planning?

**Back:**
Reviewing alternatives (e.g., Make-or-Buy analysis) to determine the best way to acquire resources.

### Card 20
**Front:**
What is the purpose of **Control Resources**?

**Back:**
To ensure that the **physical** resources assigned and allocated are available as planned, and to monitor the planned vs. actual utilization. (Note: "Manage Team" is for people; "Control Resources" is for things).

### Card 32
**Front:**
**Scenario**: You have two team members who are both "Responsible" (R) for the same task, and they are conflicting. What is the root cause?

**Back:**
Ambiguous roles. Clarify who is doing what. While multiple 'R's are allowed, clear divisions of labor are needed. Check the **RACI**.

### Card 33
**Front:**
**Scenario**: Equipment ordered for the project has been delayed by 2 weeks due to customs. This delays the critical path. What do you do?

**Back:**
Review the **Team Charter** or communication plan to see if meeting times were agreed upon. Have a private discussion to understand constraints and find a compromise.

### Card 38
**Front:**
**Scenario**: The client asks for a change. You realize you don't have the internal skills to implement it. What is this analysis called?

**Back:**
**Make-or-Buy Analysis**. You are deciding whether to train/hire (Make) or contract out (Buy).

### Card 39
**Front:**
**Scenario**: You are managing a large construction project. You need to ensure the crane is available only when the steel arrives to save rental costs. What are you doing?

**Back:**
Managing **logistics** and using **Resource Calendars** to optimize physical resource utilization/costs.

### Card 40
**Front:**
**Scenario**: An Agile team is constantly blocked because only one person knows how to test the database. What is the solution?
