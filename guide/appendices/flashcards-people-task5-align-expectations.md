### Card 72
**Front**: What is the "Cone of Uncertainty"?
**Back**: A graphical representation showing that estimates are highly uncertain at the beginning of a project (Initiation) and become more precise over time.
**Domain**: People | **Task**: Align stakeholder expectations

### Card 73
**Front**: A stakeholder demands a "Fixed Scope" AND "Fixed Date" on an Agile project.

**Domain**: People | **Task**: Align stakeholder expectations

### Card 81
**Front**: A stakeholder says, "I don't need to see the demo; just email me when it's live."
**Back**: High risk. Without the feedback loop of the Demo, there is no validation of their expectations until it's too late. Encourage participation.
**Domain**: People | **Task**: Align stakeholder expectations

### Card 82
**Front**: In Hybrid, how do you handle a "Fixed Milestone" (e.g., Trade Show)?
**Back**: Treat the Date as a constraint. Use Agile to prioritize the "Must Haves" for that date and cut "Nice to Haves" (Scope flexibility).
