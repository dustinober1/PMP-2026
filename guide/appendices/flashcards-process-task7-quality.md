## 🎯 Quality Fundamentals

### Card 1
**Front:**
What is the difference between **Quality** and **Grade**?

**Back:**
-   **Quality**: The degree to which a set of inherent characteristics fulfills requirements (No defects).
-   **Grade**: A category assigned to deliverables having the same functional use but different technical characteristics (Features/Luxury).
-   *Low Grade is acceptable; Low Quality is not.*

### Card 2
**Front:**
What is the difference between **prevention** and **inspection**?

**Back:**
-   **Prevention**: Keeping errors out of the process (Quality Assurance).
