**Domain**: Process
**Task**: Develop an integrated project management plan and plan delivery
**ECO Reference**: Process Task 1

---

##  Core Concepts & Definitions

### Card 1
**Front:**
What is the primary function of the **Project Management Plan**?

**Back:**
It is the master document that defines **how the project will be executed, monitored, controlled, and closed**. It integrates all subsidiary plans and baselines into a single cohesive strategy.

### Card 2
**Front:**
What are the three core **Baselines** that make up the Performance Measurement Baseline (PMB)?

**Back:**
1.  **Scope Baseline** (Scope Statement + WBS + WBS Dictionary)
2.  **Schedule Baseline** (Approved start/end dates)
3.  **Cost Baseline** (Time-phased budget)

### Card 3
**Front:**
In the context of the PMBOK Guide, what is **Progressive Elaboration**?

**Back:**
The iterative process of increasing the level of detail in a project management plan as greater amounts of information and more accurate estimates become available.

### Card 4
**Front:**
What is **Rolling Wave Planning**?

**Back:**
A form of progressive elaboration where **near-term work is planned in detail**, while future work is planned at a higher level (e.g., planning packages) until more information is known.

### Card 5
**Front:**
What is a **Subsidiary Management Plan**?

**Back:**
A component of the Project Management Plan that describes how a specific knowledge area (like Scope, Risk, or Cost) will be planned, executed, and controlled.
*Example: Risk Management Plan, Schedule Management Plan.*

### Card 6
**Front:**
What is the difference between a **Project Charter** and a **Project Management Plan**?

**Back:**
-   **Project Charter**: High-level, issued by the Sponsor, authorizes the project, and provides initial requirements/budget.
-   **Project Management Plan**: Detailed, developed by the PM and Team, describes specific execution strategies, and integrates all planning work.

### Card 7
**Front:**
What is the **Performance Measurement Baseline (PMB)** used for?

**Back:**
It serves as the **approved standard** against which actual project performance (scope, schedule, cost) is compared to determine if the project is on track.

### Card 8
**Front:**
If a project management plan is "integrated," what does that imply about changes?

**Back:**
It implies that a change in one area (e.g., **Scope**) must be evaluated for its impact on all other areas (e.g., **Schedule, Cost, Quality, Risk, Resources**) before approval. This is the concept of competing constraints.

### Card 9
**Front:**
What is **Tailoring** in project management?

**Back:**
The deliberate adaptation of the project management approach, governance, and processes to make them suitable for the specific project context (e.g., size, complexity, methodology).

### Card 10
**Front:**
What does it mean to be "**Methodology Agnostic**"?

**Back:**
It means the Project Manager is not tied to a single way of working (like only Waterfall or only Scrum) but selects the best approach (**Predictive, Agile, or Hybrid**) based on the project's unique needs.

---

##  Methodologies: Predictive, Agile, & Hybrid

### Card 11
**Front:**
What characterizes a **Predictive (Waterfall)** life cycle?

**Back:**
-   Scope, time, and cost are determined **early** in the project.
-   Changes are managed carefully via a formal **Change Control Board (CCB)**.
-   Best for projects with stable, well-understood requirements.

### Card 12
**Front:**
What characterizes an **Adaptive (Agile)** life cycle?

**Back:**
-   Scope is detailed **iteratively**; time and cost are fixed for iterations/sprints.
-   Change is **welcomed** and managed via the backlog.
-   Best for projects with high uncertainty or rapidly changing requirements.

### Card 13
**Front:**
What characterizes a **Hybrid** life cycle?

**Back:**
A combination of predictive and adaptive elements.
*Example: A hardware team uses Waterfall (fixed specs) while the software team uses Scrum (iterative updates) for the same product launch.*

### Card 14
**Front:**
According to the **Stacey Complexity Matrix**, when should you use an **Agile** approach?

**Back:**
When requirements are **unclear** (what to build) and technology/method is **uncertain** (how to build it), leading to a "Complex" environment that benefits from experimentation and adaptation.

### Card 15
**Front:**
In an **Agile** project, who is responsible for "planning delivery"?

**Back:**
The **Team**. While the Product Owner prioritizes potentially shippable work, the Developers estimate the effort and determine how much they can deliver in a sprint.

### Card 16
**Front:**
What is the primary planning artifact in **Scrum** that replaces the detailed WBS of Waterfall?

**Back:**
The **Product Backlog** (and subsequently the Sprint Backlog for the current iteration).

### Card 17
**Front:**
What is **Sprint Planning**?

**Back:**
A collaborative event where the Scrum Team determines **what** can be delivered in the upcoming Sprint and **how** that work will be achieved (creating the Sprint Backlog).

### Card 18
**Front:**
What is **Velocity** in Agile planning?

**Back:**
A measure of the amount of work (usually in **Story Points**) a team can tackle during a single Sprint, used to forecast future delivery capacity.

### Card 19
**Front:**
What is the **"Definition of Done" (DoD)**?

**Back:**
A shared understanding/checklist of criteria that a product increment must meet to be considered complete and release-ready. It ensures quality standards are met.

### Card 20
**Front:**
What is the **"Definition of Ready"**?

**Back:**
The criteria that a user story must meet (e.g., clear acceptance criteria, dependencies resolved) before it can be accepted into a Sprint for work.

##  Scenarios & "What Would You Do?"

### Card 21
**Front:**
**Scenario**: You are managing a construction project with strict regulatory inspections and fixed deadlines. The client wants to use "Agile" because it's a buzzword. What do you do?

**Back:**
Explain that **Predictive** is likely better due to the **high cost of change** (you can't "refactor" concrete) and regulatory constraints. You might suggest a **Hybrid** approach using Agile for the design/planning phase if appropriate.

### Card 22
**Front:**
**Scenario**: You are launching a new mobile app where user preferences are unknown. Your sponsor asks for a detailed 12-month project plan with fixed scope. What is the risk?

**Back:**
The risk is **building the wrong thing**. In high-uncertainty environments, a detailed predictive plan often fails. You should advocate for an **Adaptive/Agile** approach to validate assumptions iteratively through MVPs and user feedback.

### Card 23
**Front:**
**Scenario**: During project planning, you realize the initial budget (ROM) is insufficient for the detailed scope defined in the WBS. What is your next step?

**Back:**
You must **re-align expectations**. Options: 
1.  Request more budget based on the detailed estimate.
2.  Reduce scope to fit the available budget.
3.  Discuss trade-offs (quality, schedule) with the sponsor before baselining.

### Card 24
**Front:**
**Scenario**: A key stakeholder asks "How will we handle changes to the requirements?" during the kickoff. Where do you point them?

**Back:**
Refer them to the **Scope Management Plan** (or the Change Management Plan section of the Project Management Plan), which defines the formal process for submitting, reviewing, and approving changes.

### Card 25
**Front:**
**Scenario**: Your team is geographically distributed across three time zones. You are developing the Project Management Plan. what specific subsidiary plan needs extra attention?

**Back:**
The **Communications Management Plan**. You need explicit protocols for asynchronous work, meeting times, and tool usage to bridge the location gaps.

### Card 26
**Front:**
**Scenario**: You are in the planning phase. A Subject Matter Expert (SME) says a critical task will take 4 weeks, but the sponsor demands it be done in 2. What do you do?

**Back:**
Do **not** simply overwrite the estimate. Negotiate with the sponsor by showing the impact: "If we compress this to 2 weeks, we need double the resources (Cost) or we must cut these testing steps (Risk/Quality)."

### Card 27
**Front:**
**Scenario**: You are managing a large program with both hardware (Predictive) and software (Agile) components. How do you integrate the schedules?

**Back:**
Use a **Hybrid** schedule strategy. Maintain a master schedule with high-level dependencies and milestones (e.g., "Hardware Prototype Ready"), while the software team manages their detailed work in Sprints that align with those milestones.

### Card 28
**Front:**
**Scenario**: Your developer team wants to start coding immediately without any planning documentation. "We're Agile!" they say. How do you respond?

**Back:**
Remind them that **Agile is not "no planning."** It is "planning at the last responsible moment." Insist on a **Product Backlog** and a **Sprint Plan** to ensure we are working on what provides the most value.

### Card 29
**Front:**
**Scenario**: You have just joined a project in execution. You want to see the "Project Management Plan," but only find a Gantt chart. What is missing?

**Back:**
Everything else. A Gantt chart is just a **schedule**. You are missing the **definitions of how** to manage scope, cost, risk, quality, resources, stakeholders, and communications.

### Card 30
**Front:**
**Scenario**: Stakeholders are arguing about what "complete" means for a deliverable. How should this have been prevented during planning?

**Back:**
By clearly defining the **Acceptance Criteria** (for specific deliverables) and the **Definition of Done** (for the project/sprint) within the Scope Management Plan or Quality Management Plan.

---

##  Inputs, Tools, & Outputs (ITTOs)

What is a **Configuration Management Plan**?

**Back:**
A plan that defines how you will track and control versions of project artifacts (specs, code, documents) to ensure everyone is working on the correct "truth."

### Card 37
**Front:**
What is the difference between specific **Requirements** and the **Scope Statement**?

**Back:**
-   **Requirements**: Individual needs/wants of stakeholders (e.g., "User must login").
-   **Scope Statement**: The definitive description of the project deliverables and the work required to create them (e.g., "The Login Module").

### Card 38
**Front:**
What is the **Development Approach and Life Cycle** section of the plan?

**Back:**
The section where you explicitly state if the project will use a **Predictive, Adaptive, Iterative, Incremental, or Hybrid** approach, and define the phases (e.g., Design, Build, Test).

### Card 39

##  Competing Constraints & Integration

### Card 41
**Front:**
What are the six common **Competing Constraints** (the "Hexagon" instead of the Triangle)?

**Back:**
1.  Scope
2.  Schedule
3.  Cost
4.  Quality
5.  Resources
6.  Risk

### Card 42
**Front:**
If you crash the schedule (shorten duration) by adding resources, what is the likely impact on other constraints?

**Back:**
-   **Cost** increases (paying for more people).
-   **Risk** may increase (communication overhead).
-   **Quality** might decrease (rushing/onboarding new people).

### Card 43
**Front:**
What is **Value Engineering**?

**Back:**
An approach used during planning to optimize the project life cycle costs, save time, increase profits, or improve quality without reducing the scope/functionality.

### Card 44
**Front:**
Why is **Stakeholder Engagement** considered part of the "Integrated" plan?

**Back:**
Because a plan is useless if stakeholders don't buy into it. Engagement planning ensures that the right people are involved in creating and approving the plan.

### Card 45

### Card 47
**Front:**
What is **MVP** (Minimum Viable Product)?

**Back:**
The smallest outcome that provides value to the user and allows the team to validate assumptions. It is a key concept in "planning delivery" for Agile projects.

### Card 48
**Front:**
What is the difference between a **Phase Review** (or Kill Point) and a **Retrospective**?

**Back:**
-   **Phase Review (Predictive)**: A governance gate to approve moving to the next phase (Go/No-Go).
-   **Retrospective (Agile)**: A team meeting to inspect and adapt their *process* for improvement.

### Card 49
**Front:**
What is **Just-in-Time (JIT) Planning**?

**Back:**
Delaying detailed planning until the work is about to begin (e.g., planning the next sprint only just before it starts) to avoid wasting effort on things that might change.

### Card 50
**Front:**
What is a **Pre-Mortem**?

**Back:**
A planning exercise where the team imagines the project has *already failed* and brainstorms reasons why. It is a powerful tool to identify hidden risks and integrate responses into the plan.

##  Advanced Integration Concepts

### Card 51
**Front:**
How does **Organizational Process Assets (OPAs)** influence planning?

**Back:**
OPAs provide templates, checklists, lessons learned, and historical data from previous projects, allowing the PM to not "reinvent the wheel."

### Card 52
**Front:**
How does **Enterprise Environmental Factors (EEFs)** influence planning?

**Back:**
EEFs are internal/external conditions not under the team's control (e.g., market conditions, company culture, software tools) that constrain or direct the planning options.

### Card 53
**Front:**
What is **Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA)**?

**Back:**
The iterative cycle essential for continuous improvement and quality management, applicable to both the project product and the project management processes.

### Card 54
**Front:**
What is the significance of the **Project Management Office (PMO)** during planning?

**Back:**
The PMO may provide the framework, methodology, templates, and governance standards that the integrated plan must adhere to.

### Card 55
**Front:**
What is the **Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM)**?

**Back:**
A grid that links product requirements from their origin to the satisfy deliverables. It ensures that every requirement adds business value and is actually delivered.

### Card 56
**Front:**
In a Hybrid project, how might the **Cost Baseline** be structured?

**Back:**
It might have fixed costs for predictive phases (like hardware procurement) and "burn rates" (team salary per sprint) for adaptive phases.

### Card 57
**Front:**
What is **Manage Project Knowledge**?

**Back:**
The process of using existing knowledge and creating new knowledge. In planning, this means using **Lessons Learned** from past projects to avoid repeating mistakes.

### Card 58
**Front:**
What is the role of the **Sponsor** in the planning phase?

**Back:**
To provide resources, approve the final Project Management Plan, champion the project, and clarify scope/business needs when the team is stuck.

### Card 59
**Front:**
What is a **Constraint** in project planning?

**Back:**
A limiting factor that affects the execution of a project, program, portfolio, or process.
*Examples: Fixed budget, hard deadline, mandatory regulatory compliance.*

### Card 60
**Front:**
What is an **Assumption** in project planning?

**Back:**
A factor in the planning process that is considered to be true, real, or certain, without proof or demonstration. Assumptions introduce **risk** if they turn out to be false.

##  Agile Planning Specifics

### Card 61
**Front:**
What is **User Story Mapping**?

**Back:**
A visual exercise that organizes user stories into a useful model to help understand the functionality of the system, identify holes and omissions, and effectively plan releases.

### Card 62
**Front:**
What are **Story Points**?

**Back:**
A unit of measure for expressing the overall **size** of a user story, feature, or other piece of work. They represent **relative effort, complexity, and risk**, not hours.

### Card 63
**Front:**
What is **Planning Poker**?

**Back:**
A consensus-based estimation technique where team members use cards to estimate the effort of user stories, avoiding anchoring bias.

### Card 64
**Front:**
What is an **Information Radiator**?

**Back:**
A highly visible display (like a Kanban board or Burndown chart) that provides up-to-date project information to all stakeholders without them having to ask just by walking by.

### Card 65
**Front:**
What is the **Daily Scrum**?

**Back:**
A 15-minute time-boxed event for the Developers to inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal and adapt the Sprint Backlog as necessary, adjusting the upcoming planned work.

### Card 66
**Front:**
What is a **Spike** in Agile planning?

**Back:**
A task aimed at answering a question or gathering information, rather than producing a shippable product. It is used to reduce uncertainty before estimating a feature.

### Card 67
**Front:**
What is the purpose of **Backlog Refinement (Grooming)**?

**Back:**
The ongoing process of adding detail, estimates, and order to items in the Product Backlog, ensuring they are "Ready" for future sprints.

### Card 68
**Front:**
What is **MoSCoW** prioritization?

**Back:**
A technique to prioritize requirements:
-   **M**ust have (Critical)
-   **S**hould have (Important)
-   **C**ould have (Nice to have)
-   **W**on't have (Not now)

### Card 69
**Front:**
What is a **Release Plan** in Agile?

**Back:**
A high-level plan that indicates which features/epics are expected to be delivered in upcoming releases (groupings of sprints), though it is mutable.

### Card 70
**Front:**
What is **Agile Chartering**?

**Back:**
Creating a lightweight charter that defines the "Why," "Who," and high-level "What" (Vision, Mission, Success Criteria) to align an agile team.

##  Performance Measurement

### Card 71
**Front:**
What is **Earned Value Management (EVM)**?

**Back:**
A methodology that combines scope, schedule, and resource measurements to assess project performance and progress.
*Key Metrics: CPI, SPI.*

### Card 72
**Front:**
If your **SPI (Schedule Performance Index)** is 0.8, what does that mean?

**Back:**
You are **behind schedule**. You are effectively accomplishing only 80% of the work you planned to do in the given time.

### Card 73
**Front:**
If your **CPI (Cost Performance Index)** is 1.2, what does that mean?

**Back:**
You are **under budget**. For every $1 spent, you are getting $1.20 worth of planned value.

### Card 74
**Front:**
What is **Variance Analysis**?

**Back:**
The technique of determining the cause and degree of difference between the Baseline (Plan) and Actual performance (Reality).

### Card 75
**Front:**
What is a **Burndown Chart**?

**Back:**
A graphical representation of work left to do versus time. It is used in Agile/Scrum to track progress toward the Sprint Goal.

### Card 76
**Front:**
What is a **Burnup Chart**?

**Back:**
A chart showing the total scope (work to do) and the work completed over time. It is useful for showing scope creep (if the total scope line moves up).

### Card 77
**Front:**
What is **Throughput** in Kanban?

**Back:**
The number of items (cards) passing through a process (to "Done") within a specific period of time.

### Card 78
**Front:**
What is **Cycle Time**?

**Back:**
The time elapsed from when work actually starts on an item until it is ready for delivery.

### Card 79
**Front:**
What is **Lead Time**?

**Back:**

### Card 80
**Front:**
What is **WIP Limit** (Work In Progress)?

**Back:**
A policy in Kanban that restricts the number of items that can exist in a workflow stage at one time. It exposes bottlenecks and improves flow.

---

##  Closing the Plan

### Card 81
**Front:**
When is the Project Management Plan considered "Final"?

**Back:**
Never, technically, until the project closes. It is a **living document** that is updated via Change Control throughout the life of the project.

### Card 82
**Front:**
Who approves the Project Management Plan?

**Back:**
The **Project Sponsor** and key stakeholders (as defined by the governance/charter). The PM creates it, but the Sponsor authorizes it.

### Card 83
**Front:**
What happens if you find a major gap in the plan during Execution?

**Back:**
You initiate a **Change Request** to update the relevant subsidiary plan or baseline. You do not just "fix it on the fly" without analysis.

### Card 84
**Front:**
How does the plan relate to **Procurement**?

**Back:**
The plan dictates **what** needs to be bought and **when**. The Procurement Management Plan specifically details the types of contracts and selection criteria.

### Card 85
**Front:**
How does the plan relate to **Quality**?

**Back:**
The Quality Management Plan defines the standards (e.g., ISO, coding regs) that the project must meet. The plan ensures resources and time are allocated for testing/QA.

### Card 86
**Front:**
What is the **Scope Management Plan**'s main job?

**Back:**
It does **not** define the scope (that's the purpose of the Scope Statement). It explains **the process** for how you will define, validate, and control scope.

### Card 87
**Front:**
What is the **Schedule Management Plan**'s main job?

**Back:**
It establishes the criteria and activities for developing, monitoring, and controlling the schedule (e.g., unit of measure: hours vs days, accuracy levels).

### Card 88
**Front:**
What is the **Cost Management Plan**'s main job?

**Back:**
It establishes how costs will be planned, structured, and controlled (e.g., currency used, reporting thresholds for variance).

### Card 89
**Front:**
What is the **Stakeholder Engagement Plan**'s main job?

**Back:**
It identifies the strategies and actions required to promote productive involvement of stakeholders in project decision-making and execution.

### Card 90
**Front:**
What is the **Resource Management Plan**'s main job?

**Back:**
It describes how project resources (team and physical) should be categorized, allocated, managed, and released.

##  Quick-Fire Review

### Card 91
**Front:**
**True or False**: In Agile, there is no Project Management Plan.

**Back:**
**False**. There is a plan, but it is lighter weight, updated frequently, and often spread across artifacts like the Backlog, Roadmap, and Team Charter.

### Card 92
**Front:**
**True or False**: The Project Manager must write every word of the plan personally.

**Back:**
**False**. The PM integrates the plan, but Team Members and SMEs should help write the technical estimates and subsidiary plans.

### Card 93
**Front:**
**True or False**: Baselines can be changed whenever the project runs behind.

**Back:**
**False**. Baselines can only be changed through approved **Change Requests**. Changing the baseline just to hide poor performance is unethical.

### Card 94
**Front:**
**True or False**: A Project Management Plan is required for small projects.

**Back:**
**True**, but it should be **tailored**. A small project plan might be a 2-page document, while a mega-project plan might be hundreds of pages.

### Card 95
**Front:**
Which approach uses "Servant Leadership" as a primary planning enabler?

**Back:**
**Agile**. The leader clears the path (removes impediments) so the team can execute the plan they created.

### Card 96
**Front:**
What is the "Cone of Uncertainty"?

**Back:**
The concept that estimates are very inaccurate (wide range) at the start of learning/planning and become more accurate (narrow range) as the project progresses.

### Card 97
**Front:**
What is **Parkinson's Law**?

**Back:**
"Work expands to fill the time available for its completion." (Reason to use time-boxing/Sprints).

### Card 98
**Front:**
What is **Student Syndrome**?

**Back:**
Procrastination: waiting until the last possible moment to apply oneself to a task. (Another reason for Sprints/Milestones).

### Card 99
**Front:**
What is the **Critical Path**?

**Back:**
The sequence of activities that represents the longest path through a project, which determines the shortest possible project duration.

### Card 100
**Front:**
If you have zero float (slack) on an activity, where is it located?

**Back:**
On the **Critical Path**. Any delay to this activity will delay the project finish date.
