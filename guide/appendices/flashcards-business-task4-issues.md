**Domain**: Business Environment
**Task**: Remove impediments and manage issues
**ECO Reference**: Business Task 4

---

## 🚧 Impediments vs. Issues vs. Risks

### Card 1
**Front:**
What is the difference between a **Risk** and an **Issue**?

**Back:**
-   **Risk**: Uncertain *future* event (has not happened yet).
-   **Issue**: Current *present* problem (is happening now).

### Card 2
**Front:**
What is an **Impediment** (Blocker)?

**Back:**
Anything that prevents the team from performing work or meeting objectives (e.g., missing license, down server). Key term in Agile.

### Card 3
**Front:**
**Scenario**: A risk event you identified has occurred. What does it become?

**Back:**
An **Issue**. Move it from the Risk Register to the Issue Log.

### Card 4
**Front:**
**Scenario**: The team is blocked by a missing server access. Who is responsible for removing this impediment?

**Back:**
The **Scrum Master** (or Project Manager/Servant Leader).

### Card 5
**Front:**
**Scenario**: An issue arises that exceeds the Project Manager's authority to resolve (e.g., funding). What do you do?

**Back:**
**Escalate** it to the Sponsor or Steering Committee.

### Card 6
**Front:**
What is the **Issue Log** used for?

**Back:**
To document, track, and assign owners to problems that are currently affecting the project.

### Card 7
**Front:**
**Scenario**: You find a problem. You fix it immediately. Do you log it?

**Back:**
**Yes**. Log it as closed to capture the history and lessons learned.

### Card 8
**Front:**
What is the "Daily Standup" role in impediment management?

**Back:**
To **Identify** blockers. (Not necessarily to solve them right there).

### Card 9
**Front:**
**Scenario**: A stakeholder is blocking a decision.

**Back:**
Treat it as an **Impediment**. Discuss with the stakeholder, understand the root cause, and facilitate a decision. Escalate if deadlocked.

### Card 10
**Front:**
What is the **Escalation Process**?

**Back:**
Documented steps in the Communications Management Plan defining when and how to raise issues to higher levels of authority.

---

## ⚔️ Conflict Management

### Card 11
**Front:**
What is the **Best** conflict resolution technique for long-term solutions?

**Back:**
**Collaborate / Problem Solve** (Win-Win). Addresses the root cause.

### Card 12
**Front:**
**Scenario**: Two team members disagree on a technical approach. Time is NOT critical. What technique do you use?

**Back:**
**Collaborate**. Use a whiteboard/data to find the best technical solution.

### Card 13
**Front:**
**Scenario**: Two stakeholders are fighting. You are in an emergency and need a decision NOW to ensure safety.

**Back:**
**Force / Direct**. (Win-Lose). Use authority.

### Card 14
**Front:**
**Scenario**: Both parties need to give up something to reach a temporary agreement.

**Back:**
**Compromise**. (Lose-Lose).

### Card 15
**Front:**
**Scenario**: The issue is trivial, or emotions are too high to discuss.

**Back:**
**Withdraw / Avoid**. (Retreat). Wait for cool-down.

### Card 16
**Front:**
**Scenario**: You want to preserve the relationship, and the issue is more important to them than to you.

**Back:**
**Smooth / Accommodate**. (Lose-Win).

### Card 17
**Front:**
**Scenario**: "Personality Clash" vs "Process Issue"?

**Back:**
Most "personality" conflicts are actually **process** conflicts (unclear roles, goals). Fix the process first.

### Card 18
**Front:**
**True or False**: Conflict is bad and should be suppressed.

**Back:**
**False**. Constructive conflict (Task Conflict) leads to better ideas. Relationship conflict is bad.

## 🛠️ Issue Management Toolkit

### Card 19
**Front:**
What goes in an **Issue Log**?

**Back:**
Issue ID, Description, Priority, Owner, Target Date, Status.

### Card 20
**Front:**
**Scenario**: An issue is assigned to a team member. They haven't fixed it by the due date.

**Back:**
**Follow Up** (Control). Ask: "What do you need to unblock this?"

### Card 21
**Front:**
What is a **Decision Log**?

**Back:**
A record of all key decisions made, who made them, and when. Prevents "re-litigating" old decisions.

### Card 22
**Front:**
**Scenario**: The team generates too many impediments.

**Back:**
Look for the **Root Cause**. Use a Retrospective to fix the systemic issue.

### Card 23
**Front:**
What is **Root Cause Analysis (RCA)**?

**Back:**
A technique (e.g., 5 Whys, Fishbone) to find the underlying reason for a defect or issue.

### Card 24
**Front:**
**Scenario**: A vendor is non-responsive. This is an issue.

**Back:**
Check the **Contract** (SLA). Escalate according to the procurement terms.

### Card 25
**Front:**
**Scenario**: You have an issue with valid solutions A and B.

**Back:**
Use **Decision Making** techniques (e.g., Voting, Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis) to choose. Record in Decision Log.

### Card 26
**Front:**
**Scenario**: An impediment requires money to fix.

**Back:**
Check **Reserves**. If within PM authority (Contingency), use it. If not, submit **Change Request** for Management Reserve.

### Card 27
**Front:**
**Scenario**: A "Swarm" or "Mob" approach?

**Back:**
Agile technique where the whole team focuses on fixing a critical blocked item together.

### Card 28
**Front:**
What is **Technical Debt** dealing with?

**Back:**
It's an issue of "future rework" accumulating. It impedes velocity over time.

### Card 29
**Front:**
**Scenario**: A team member hides an issue because they are afraid.

**Back:**
Lack of **Psychological Safety**. The PM must build trust so bad news can travel fast.

### Card 30
**Front:**
What is the relationship between **Quality Control** and Issues?

**Back:**
QC identifies defects. Defects are issues.

---

## 🧠 Situational Issues

### Card 31
**Front:**
**Scenario**: The client refuses to sign off on a deliverable.

**Back:**
Check **Acceptance Criteria**. If met, show them. If not met, fix it (Defect Repair).

### Card 32
**Front:**
**Scenario**: You take over a project. No Issue Log effectively exists.

**Back:**
**Create one immediately**. Interview the team to find what is blocking them.

### Card 33
**Front:**
**Scenario**: An issue affects the Critical Path.

**Back:**
**High Urgency**. It will delay the project end date. Crash/Fast Track or Escalate.

### Card 34
**Front:**
**Scenario**: You are spending 100% of your time fighting fires (issues).

**Back:**
You are failing at **Risk Management**. Effective Risk Management reduces Issues.

### Card 35
**Front:**
**Scenario**: A stakeholder complains about "Lack of Communication."

**Back:**
This is an Issue. Review the **Communications Management Plan** and adjust.

### Card 36
**Front:**

**Back:**
This is an Issue (People). Conduct a **Retrospective** or **Team Assessment** to find the cause.

### Card 38
**Front:**
**Scenario**: The test environment is unstable.

**Back:**
Impediment. Fix the infrastructure. It impacts quality and schedule.

### Card 39
**Front:**
**Scenario**: "Analysis Paralysis" - Team can't decide.

**Back:**
PM must facilitate or **Make the Decision** (if empowered) to unblock progress.

### Card 40
**Front:**
**Scenario**: External dependency (Permit) is delayed.

**Back:**
Impediment. Check the specific Risk Response if planned. If not, update schedule and communicate impact.

## 🧠 Final Exam Tips

### Card 51
**Front:**
**Exam Tip**: Team is arguing about a technical detail.

**Back:**
**Collaborate**. Let the experts decide. Do not "Force" a technical decision unless you are the expert (unlikely).

### Card 52
**Front:**
**Exam Tip**: Blocker surfaces in Daily Scrum.

**Back:**
Scrum Master notes it. Discusses it **After** the meeting (Parking Lot). Do not solve during the 15 min.

### Card 53
**Front:**
**Exam Tip**: Stakeholder resistance is an issue.

**Back:**
Meet with them. Understand their **Interests** (not just positions).

### Card 54
**Front:**
**Exam Tip**: "Fail Fast"?

**Back:**
Finding issues early (testing) is cheaper than fixing them later.

### Card 55
**Front:**
**Exam Tip**: PM's primary role in Agile execution?

**Back:**
Removing impediments (Servant Leadership).

### Card 56
**Front:**
**Exam Tip**: When to escalate?

**Back:**
Only when the issue is beyond your control/authority or resources. Try to solve at the lowest level first.

### Card 57
**Front:**
**Exam Tip**: "Root Cause Analysis" tool?

**Back:**
Fishbone Diagram (Ishikawa) or 5 Whys.

### Card 58
**Front:**
**Exam Tip**: "Pareto Chart"?

## 🌐 Advanced Scenarios & Virtual Teams

### Card 61
**Front:**
**Scenario**: A team member in a different time zone hasn't attended standups for 3 days. What do you do first?

**Back:**
Reach out **privately** via 1-on-1 message/call. Don't assume—check if they're blocked, sick, or disengaged. "No news" in virtual teams is a red flag, not a sign things are fine.

### Card 62
**Front:**
**Scenario**: During Sprint Review, stakeholders say "This isn't what we wanted" despite meeting requirements. What do you do?

**Back:**
**Listen first**. Ask: "What were you expecting?" Then re-validate outcomes (not outputs). This reveals a gap in requirements elicitation, not necessarily a delivery failure.

### Card 63
**Front:**
**Scenario**: A vendor is 2 weeks late on a deliverable. The contract has a $1,000/day penalty clause. What do you do first?

**Back:**
**Check the contract** (SLA terms). Document the issue, formally notify the vendor per contract terms, and invoke penalty if applicable. Contracts are the rulebook for vendor issues.

### Card 64
**Front:**
**Scenario**: Two team members conflict during a remote meeting. The chat is getting heated. What is your FIRST action?

**Back:**
**Intervene immediately**—pause the meeting, suggest a cool-down break, then address offline. Never let relationship conflict fester in a group setting.

### Card 65
**Front:**
What is the difference between a **Change Request** and an **Issue**?

**Back:**
- **Change Request**: Proposed modification to baselines (scope/schedule/cost) — hasn't happened yet.
- **Issue**: Current problem actively affecting the project — already happening.

### Card 66
**Front:**
**Scenario**: The team keeps "re-litigating" a decision from 2 weeks ago. What artifact is missing?

**Back:**
**Decision Log**. Documenting the decision, who made it, and why prevents circular debates.

### Card 67
**Front:**
**Scenario**: A functional manager pulls your key developer for "emergency" work during sprint execution. What do you do?

**Back:**
**Negotiate**. Explain impact on sprint commitment. If that fails, **escalate** to the Sponsor per the resource management plan. Protect the team's focus.

### Card 68
**Front:**
**Scenario**: The team's velocity is dropping 20% each sprint. Morale seems low. What do you do?

**Back:**
Conduct a **Team Assessment** or **Retrospective** to find the root cause. Velocity issues are often symptoms (burnout, blockers, unclear requirements), not the problem itself.

### Card 69
**Front:**
What is **BATNA** in negotiation and when do you use it?

**Back:**
**Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement** — your "Plan B" if talks fail. Never negotiate without knowing your BATNA; the stronger it is, the more leverage you have.

### Card 70
**Front:**
**Scenario**: A stakeholder emails you with "Urgent: add this feature by Friday." You're at capacity. What do you do?

**Back:**
**Respond quickly** but don't promise. Assess impact, then follow the change process: "I'll evaluate this and bring options to the CCB/backlog refinement." Never bypass impact analysis.

---

## 🔀 Cross-Task & Risk Integration

### Card 71
**Front:**
**Scenario**: Product Owner and Scrum Master argue constantly about prioritization. The team is stuck in the middle. What do you do?

**Back:**
Facilitate a **collaborative session**. Use data (value, risk, dependency) to create prioritization criteria. Most "priority fights" are actually missing objective criteria.

### Card 72
**Front:**
**Scenario**: A risk you identified (Prob: 0.3, Impact: $50K) has occurred. Your contingency reserve was $15K. What do you do?

**Back:**
Execute the planned response, log the issue, then submit a **Change Request** for the remaining $35K from management reserve. Actual impact exceeded your contingency.

### Card 73
**Front:**
What is a **Secondary Risk**?

**Back:**
A new risk **created by implementing a risk response**. Example: Switching to a backup vendor (response) creates a new integration risk (secondary risk).

### Card 74
**Front:**
**Scenario**: A team member says "I don't have access to the repository." This has happened 3 times this sprint. What is the real issue?

**Back:**
A **process issue**, not just an access problem. The onboarding/checklist is broken. Fix the systemic root cause (update checklist) so it doesn't recur.

### Card 75
**Front:**
**Scenario**: You discover technical debt is accumulating. The team says "we'll fix it later." What do you do?

**Back:**
Make it **visible**. Track it, allocate capacity each sprint to pay it down, and educate stakeholders on the risk of ignoring it. Technical debt is an impediment to future velocity.

## 🔄 Agile Execution Patterns

### Card 76
**Front:**
**Scenario**: During a Daily Standup, a technical debate erupts and time is running out. What do you do?

**Back:**
**Park it**. "Let's take this offline after the standup." The Daily Scrum is for synchronization, not problem-solving.

### Card 77
**Front:**
**Scenario**: Your Kanban board shows WIP increasing across all columns. Flow is slowing. What does this indicate?

**Back:**
**Bottleneck**. Too much work-in-progress prevents completion. Reduce WIP limits, focus on finishing, swarm on blocked items.

### Card 78
**Front:**
**Scenario**: A senior team member dominates retrospectives. Junior members stay quiet. What do you do?

**Back:**
Use **facilitation techniques**: round-robin, silent brainstorming, anonymous input. Ensure all voices are heard—dominance kills psychological safety.

### Card 79
**Front:**
**Scenario**: Stakeholder says "Why wasn't I told about this delay?" You sent weekly status reports. What went wrong?

**Back:**
**Communication method mismatch**. Reports were push; stakeholder needed interactive (meetings) or pull (dashboard). Tailor communication to the stakeholder.

### Card 80
**Front:**
What is the difference between **Tacit** and **Explicit Knowledge**?

**Back:**
- **Explicit**: Codified knowledge that can be written down (manuals, code, documents).
- **Tacit**: Experience-based "know-how" transferred through social interaction (mentoring, collaboration, shadowing).

## 👥 Team Performance & People Issues

### Card 81
**Front:**
**Scenario**: A team member's performance is declining. They were a star performer. What do you do FIRST?

**Back:**
Meet **privately** and listen. Ask: "How are things going? What blockers do you have?" Performance issues are often personal issues or systemic blockers, not capability problems.

### Card 82
**Front:**
**Scenario**: You take over a project mid-execution. There's no Issue Log. Team says "we just fix things as they come up." What do you do?

**Back:**
**Create an Issue Log immediately**. Then interview the team to capture known issues. "No issues logged" usually means issues are being handled reactively without tracking.

### Card 83
**Front:**
**Scenario**: A defect is found in production. The same defect was reported 3 months ago. What failed?

**Back:**
**Quality control AND knowledge management**. The defect wasn't fixed properly, and the lesson wasn't captured. Root cause the fix, update DoD, log the lesson.

### Card 84
**Front:**
What is **MoSCoW** prioritization and when is it used?

**Back:**
- **M**ust have: Critical for release
- **S**hould have: Important but not critical
- **C**ould have: Nice to have if time permits
- **W**on't have: Deferred to future
Used for backlog prioritization and change request triage.

### Card 85
**Front:**
**Scenario**: Operations refuses to accept the project deliverable. "We're not ready to support this." What do you do?

**Back:**
Don't force handoff. Assess **readiness gaps** (training, docs, support staffing) and close them. Value collapses without operational adoption.

### Card 86
**Front:**
**Scenario**: A team member says "I don't know why we're building this. It seems pointless." What issue is this?

**Back:**
A **vision/alignment** issue. The team doesn't understand the product vision or value proposition. Reconnect the team to the "why"—purpose drives engagement.

---

## 🤝 Advanced Negotiation & Decision-Making

### Card 87
**Front:**
What is **ZOPA** and why does it matter in negotiation?

**Back:**
**Zone of Possible Agreement** — the overlap between what a buyer will pay and what a seller will accept. If there's no ZOPA, no deal is possible without changing terms.

### Card 88
**Front:**
**Scenario**: During Sprint Planning, the Product Owner tries to assign specific tasks to specific team members. What do you do?

**Back:**
**Intervene**. Remind PO that teams are **self-organizing**—the team pulls work and assigns tasks. PO defines WHAT; team decides HOW and WHO.

### Card 89
**Front:**
**Scenario**: Multiple stakeholders request competing features. Each says theirs is "highest priority." What technique do you use?

**Back:**
**Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis** or **Value-Based Prioritization**. Use objective criteria (business value, risk, dependency, cost) to prioritize, not just volume of requests.

### Card 90
**Front:**
What is **Reservation Price** in negotiation?

**Back:**
The **worst acceptable outcome** — your "walk-away" point. If the deal is worse than this, you decline and execute your BATNA.

---

## 🌐 Virtual Team & Hybrid Challenges

### Card 91
**Front:**
**Scenario**: A virtual team member's camera is always off, they type "OK" a lot, and haven't spoken in weeks. What do you do?

**Back:**
**Schedule a 1-on-1**. Check for disengagement, blockers, or personal issues. In virtual teams, silence ≠ agreement—it often means disengagement.

### Card 92
**Front:**
**Scenario**: The team completes all sprint commitments but velocity dropped 30%. Is this a problem?

**Back:**
Maybe. If story point estimates changed (recalibration), it's fine. If the team is actually delivering less value, investigate: burnout, gold-plating, or scope creep within stories.

### Card 93
**Front:**
What is the **5 Whys** technique used for?

**Back:**
**Root Cause Analysis**. Ask "why" five times to drill down from symptom to underlying cause. Example: "Why did the deployment fail? → Tests weren't run. → Why? → No time. → Why? → Scope too large..." Root cause: poor estimation/sizing.

### Card 94
**Front:**
**Scenario**: A stakeholder resists the project actively. They question every decision in meetings. What approach do you take?

**Back:**
**Active listening 1-on-1**. Understand their interests (not positions). Resistance often comes from fear, unaddressed concern, or feeling excluded. Involve them in solutions.

### Card 95
**Front:**
**Scenario**: Your CCB (Change Control Board) meets monthly. A critical change request needs approval now. What do you do?

**Back:**
Check if **PM has delegation authority** for this impact level. If not, convene an **emergency CCB meeting** or use email/phone decision per governance framework. Don't bypass formal approval.

## 🧠 Final Exam Mastery Cards

### Card 96
**Front:**
**Scenario**: Team says "We can't start Story B because we're waiting for Story A from another team." What is this?

**Back:**
A **dependency impediment**. Log it, make it visible, coordinate with the other team's PM/SM, and escalate if the dependency threatens the sprint.

### Card 97
**Front:**
What is **Integrative Negotiation** and when is it used?

**Back:**
**"Expand the pie"** negotiation — finding win-win solutions by creating value for both parties. Used for most project situations (partnerships, long-term contracts, team agreements). Focuses on **interests, not positions**.

### Card 98
**Front:**
**Scenario**: After implementing a risk response, a NEW risk emerges. What is this called?

**Back:**
**Secondary Risk**. It must be identified, analyzed, and added to the Risk Register. Example: Using a backup vendor (response) creates integration risk (secondary risk).

### Card 99
**Front:**
**Scenario**: The team consistently skips retrospectives because "we're too busy." What is the risk?

**Back:**
**Continuous improvement stops**. The team stops learning and will repeat mistakes. Retrospectives are the agile engine for improvement—skipping them is false economy.

### Card 100
**Front:**
**Exam Tip**: When you see "What should the PM do FIRST?" in an issue/impediment scenario, what's usually the best answer?

**Back:**
- If blocked: **Remove/escalate immediately**
- If conflict: **Understand before acting** (listen, gather facts)
- If change request: **Assess impact before deciding**
- If stakeholder issue: **Engage 1-on-1 first**
- If risk occurred: **Execute the planned response**
