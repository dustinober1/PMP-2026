## 🚧 Impediments vs. Issues vs. Risks

### Card 1
**Front:**
What is the difference between a **Risk** and an **Issue**?

**Back:**
-   **Risk**: Uncertain *future* event (has not happened yet).
-   **Issue**: Current *present* problem (is happening now).

### Card 2
**Front:**
What is an **Impediment** (Blocker)?

**Back:**
Anything that prevents the team from performing work or meeting objectives (e.g., missing license, down server). Key term in Agile.

### Card 3
**Front:**
**Scenario**: A risk event you identified has occurred. What does it become?

**Back:**
An **Issue**. Move it from the Risk Register to the Issue Log.

### Card 4
**Front:**
**Scenario**: The team is blocked by a missing server access. Who is responsible for removing this impediment?

**Back:**
The **Scrum Master** (or Project Manager/Servant Leader).

### Card 5
**Front:**
**Scenario**: An issue arises that exceeds the Project Manager's authority to resolve (e.g., funding). What do you do?

**Back:**
**Escalate** it to the Sponsor or Steering Committee.

### Card 6
**Front:**
What is the **Issue Log** used for?

**Back:**
To document, track, and assign owners to problems that are currently affecting the project.

**Back:**
To **Identify** blockers. (Not necessarily to solve them right there).

### Card 9

**Back:**
Documented steps in the Communications Management Plan defining when and how to raise issues to higher levels of authority.

### Card 17
**Front:**
**Scenario**: "Personality Clash" vs "Process Issue"?

Most "personality" conflicts are actually **process** conflicts (unclear roles, goals). Fix the process first.
