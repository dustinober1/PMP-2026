##  Integrated Change Control (ICC)

### Card 1
**Front:**
What is the primary purpose of **Perform Integrated Change Control**?

**Back:**
To review all change requests, approve/defer/reject changes to deliverables and organizational process assets, and **communicate decisions**. It protects the Baselines.

### Card 2
**Front:**
What are the **3 Baselines** protected by Change Control?

**Back:**
1. Scope Baseline
2. Schedule Baseline
3. Cost Baseline
(Together: The Performance Measurement Baseline).

### Card 3
**Front:**
Who typically approves a Change Request (CR) that impacts the baselines?

**Back:**
The **Change Control Board (CCB)**.

### Card 4
**Front:**
Who approves a Change Request that does **not** impact baselines (e.g., minor correction within bounds)?

**Back:**
Often the **Project Manager**, depending on the Change Management Plan.

### Card 5
**Front:**
**Scenario**: A stakeholder requests a "small" change. What is the **First Step**?

**Back:**
**Analyze the Impact** (Scope, Schedule, Cost, Quality, Risk). Do not say "Yes" or "No" until you know the cost.

### Card 6
**Front:**
**Scenario**: You have analyzed a change and it requires more budget. What is the **Second Step**?

**Back:**
Submit a formal **Change Request** to the CCB (or Sponsor) for approval.

### Card 7
**Front:**
**Scenario**: The CCB rejects a key change request. What do you do?

**Back:**
**Document the rejection** in the Change Log, communicate it to the requestor, and continue executing the original plan.

### Card 8
**Front:**
What is **Configuration Management**?

**Back:**
A system that ensures the product's functional and physical characteristics are properly defined and verified (Version Control for the Product).

### Card 9
**Front:**
What is the difference between **Change Control** and **Configuration Control**?

**Back:**
-   **Change Control**: Managing changes to documents/baselines/procedures.
-   **Configuration Control**: Managing changes to product specs/versions.

### Card 10
**Front:**
What is **Scope Creep**?

**Back:**
The uncontrolled expansion to product or project scope without adjustments to time, cost, and resources. (Failure of ICC).

##  The Change Control Board (CCB)

### Card 11
**Front:**
What is the **CCB** composed of?

**Back:**
Key stakeholders (e.g., Sponsor, Customer, Experts). The PM is usually a member but often non-voting or facilitator.

### Card 12
**Front:**
**Scenario**: An emergency change is needed to fix a production outage. The CCB meets next week.

**Back:**
Follow the **Emergency Change Process** defined in the Change Management Plan (e.g., PM approves, CCB reviews retroactively).

### Card 13
**Front:**
Does the CCB exist in **Agile**?

**Back:**
Not usually for team-level changes (Product Owner decides). But for **Project-Level** changes (Budget, Release Date), a governing body might still exist.

### Card 14
**Front:**
What document guides how changes are approved?

**Back:**
The **Change Management Plan**.

### Card 15
**Front:**
**Scenario**: A Change Request is approved. What is the **Immediate Next Step**?

**Back:**
**Update the Baselines** (Plan) and then **Implement** the change.

### Card 16
**Front:**
**Scenario**: A Change Request is approved. What happens to the **Change Log**?

**Back:**
Update status to "Approved."

### Card 17
**Front:**
Who initiates a Change Request?

**Back:**
**Anyone** (Team, Stakeholder, Sponsor, PM). But the PM analyzes it.

### Card 18
**Front:**
Can a **Change Request** be for something other than Scope?

**Back:**
Yes. It can be for Schedule (extension), Cost (budget), or Quality (standards). Also for **Corrective/Preventive Actions**.

### Card 19
**Front:**
What is **Corrective Action**?

**Back:**
An intentional activity that realigns the performance of the project work with the project management plan. (Fixing a deviation).

### Card 20
**Front:**
What is **Defect Repair**?

**Back:**
An intentional activity to modify a nonconforming product or product component.

##  Agile Change Management

### Card 21
**Front:**
How are "Change Requests" handled in **Scrum**?

**Back:**
New requirements go into the **Product Backlog**. The Product Owner prioritizes them.

### Card 22
**Front:**
Can you change scope in the **Middle of a Sprint**?

**Back:**
Generally **No** (unless it clarifies valid scope). New features wait for the *Next* Sprint.

### Card 23
**Front:**
If the Product Owner wants to swap a story in the current Sprint for a new one of equal size?

**Back:**
It requires the **Team's agreement**. If it endangers the Sprint Goal, the Team can refuse.

### Card 24
**Front:**
What is the "Cost of Change" curve in Agile vs Waterfall?

**Back:**
Agile aims to keep the cost of change low throughout the lifecycle (flat curve) via Iterative delivery. Waterfall cost of change rises effectively over time.

### Card 25
**Front:**
Who is the "CCB" in Agile?

**Back:**
The **Product Owner** (for Scope).

### Card 26
**Front:**
**Scenario**: The Agile team discovers a new regulation.

**Back:**
It becomes a **Constraint**. The PO puts the compliance work at the top of the Backlog.

### Card 27
**Front:**
What is **Backlog Refinement**?

**Back:**
The ongoing process of reviewing and updating the backlog items (Changes are processed here).

### Card 28
**Front:**
**Scenario**: The customer dislikes the demo. They want changes.

**Back:**
This is **Feedback**. It goes into the Product Backlog for prioritization.

### Card 29
**Front:**
Does "Agile" mean "No Documentation of Changes"?

**Back:**
**No**. The Backlog is the documentation. The definition of Done is the standard.

### Card 30
**Front:**
What is the **Sprint Review**?

**Back:**
A formal opportunity to inspect the increment and **adapt the backlog** (Approve changes/feedback).

##  Change Scenarios

### Card 31
**Front:**
**Scenario**: You are in execution. A team member adds a "cool feature" that wasn't asked for.

**Back:**
**Gold Plating**. It is bad practice. Reject it, or file a Change Request if the customer validates it.

### Card 32
**Front:**
**Scenario**: The project is over budget. You want to cut scope to save money.

**Back:**
Submit a **Change Request** to reduce the Scope Baseline. You cannot just delete scope without approval.

### Card 33
**Front:**
**Scenario**: A stakeholder sends you an email asking for a change.

**Back:**
Formalize it. Put it into a **Change Request Form**. Don't work off emails.

### Card 34
**Front:**
**Scenario**: You implement a change without updating the plan. Now the schedule is red. Why?

**Back:**
Because you didn't **Update the Baseline**. You are being measured against the old plan.

### Card 35
**Front:**
**Scenario**: A change is approved, but the team is resistant to doing it.

**Back:**
**Manage Stakeholders/Team**. Explain the "Why." Resistance to change is a People/Leadership issue.

### Card 36
**Front:**
**Scenario**: The client asks for a change. You say "Yes" immediately to build relationship.

**Back:**
**Wrong**. You failed to Analyze Impact. You might have just destroyed the schedule.

### Card 37
**Front:**
**Scenario**: Five small changes come in. Individually they are small. Together they are huge.

**Back:**
**Death by 1,000 Cuts** (Scope Creep). Analyze the *cumulative* impact.

### Card 38
**Front:**
What is a **Preventive Action**?

**Back:**
Action taken to ensure *future* performance aligns with the plan. (Avoiding a risk). Requires a Change Request.

### Card 39
**Front:**
**Scenario**: You find a defect. Fixing it requires 2 days. Do you need a Change Request?

**Back:**
If it impacts the Baseline (Schedule/Cost), **Yes**. If it fits within the existing task variance? Maybe not formal CCB, but document it.

### Card 40
**Front:**
**Scenario**: The Sponsor verbally approves a change.

**Back:**
**Document it**. Get a signature or email confirmation. "Verbal" is risky.

##  Quick-Fire Change Review

### Card 41
**Front:**
**True or False**: All changes require CCB approval.

**Back:**
**False**. Some are delegated to the PM (Standard changes).

### Card 42
**Front:**
**True or False**: You can change the baseline whenever you want.

**Back:**
**False**. Only via approved Change Requests.

### Card 43
**Front:**
**True or False**: Agile projects don't use baselines.

**Back:**
**False**. They often have high-level baselines (Budget, Release Date), even if scope is flexible.

### Card 44
**Front:**
What is **Impact Analysis**?

**Back:**
Checking how a change affects Time, Cost, Scope, Quality, Risk, and Resources.

### Card 45
**Front:**
Who is responsible for documenting changes?

**Back:**
The **Project Manager** (Change Log).

### Card 46
**Front:**
 What is a **Change Control System**?

**Back:**
The set of procedures that describes how modifications to the project deliverables and documentation are managed.

### Card 47
**Front:**
**True or False**: "Just Do It" is a valid Change Management strategy.

**Back:**
**False**. Uncontrolled change is chaos.

### Card 48
**Front:**
**Scenario**: A change requires new skills the team doesn't have.

**Back:**
It impacts **Resources** (Training/Hiring). Include this cost in the Change Request.

### Card 49
**Front:**
**Scenario**: The customer cancels the project via a "Major Change."

**Back:**
Move to **Close Project or Phase** (Premature Closure).

### Card 50
**Front:**
What happens to the **Risk Register** when a change is approved?

**Back:**
It must be **Updated**. New changes bring new risks.
