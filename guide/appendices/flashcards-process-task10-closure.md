**Domain**: Process
**Task**: Manage project closure
**ECO Reference**: Process Task 10

---

##  Closure Fundamentals

### Card 1
**Front:**
What is **Administrative Closure**?

**Back:**
The formal process of verifying and documenting project results to formalize acceptance of the product, service, or result by the sponsor or customer.

### Card 2
**Front:**
What is **Procurement Closure**?

**Back:**
The verification that all work and deliverables in a contract have been completed and officially accepted, and that final payment has been made.

### Card 3
**Front:**
What is the prerequisites for Closing?

**Back:**
**Accepted Deliverables** (from Validate Scope). You cannot close until the customer has formally signed off.

### Card 4
**Front:**
What is the **Final Report**?

**Back:**
A summary of the project performance (Scope, Schedule, Cost, Quality), variances, and confirmation that the business case was achieved.

### Card 5
**Front:**
What is **Benefits Realization** at Closure?

**Back:**
Checking if the project delivered the promised benefits. For intangible/long-term benefits, the PM hands off the *Benefits Management Plan* to Operations.

### Card 6
**Front:**
What is a **Punch List**?

**Back:**
A list of minor outstanding items (defects) that need to be fixed, often agreed upon as a condition for "Substantial Completion" or conditional acceptance.

### Card 7
**Front:**
What are **Organizational Process Assets (OPAs)** updates?

**Back:**
Archiving project files, lessons learned, historical data, and templates so the organization can use them in the future.

### Card 8
**Front:**
What is **Transition Planning**?

**Back:**
Planning how to move the deliverable from the project team to the operations/maintenance team (e.g., training, documentation).

### Card 9
**Front:**
**Scenario**: The project was cancelled because the budget was cut. Do you simply stop working?

**Back:**
**No**. You must perform **Administrative Closure** (document status, pay vendors, release team, archive work).

### Card 10
**Front:**
**Scenario**: The customer loves the product but refuses to sign off because they want "one more small feature." What do you do?

**Back:**
Refer to the **Acceptance Criteria**. If met, you push for sign-off. The new feature is a *new project* or a *change request*.

##  Steps to Close

### Card 11
**Front:**
What is the generally accepted **Order of Closure**?

**Back:**
1. Get Acceptance (Validate Scope).
2. Close Procurements.
3. Final Report / Lessons Learned.
4. Archive Records.
5. Release Team.

### Card 12
**Front:**
Why do you **Close Procurements** before closing the project?

**Back:**
Because you might need the vendor to fix defects (validate scope). Once the project is closed, the budget is gone.

### Card 13
**Front:**
Where do **Lessons Learned** go?

**Back:**
Into the **Lessons Learned Repository** (a corporate knowledge base), making them part of Organizational Process Assets.

### Card 14
**Front:**
What happens to the **Resources** (Team) at closing?

**Back:**
They are **Released** back to their functional managers or reassigned to new projects.

### Card 15
**Front:**
How do you confirm **Financial Closure**?

**Back:**
Ensure all invoices are paid, no claims are outstanding, and the project cost code is deactivated.

### Card 16
**Front:**
What is a **Post-Project Review**?

**Back:**
A meeting held after closure (sometimes months later) to evaluate the long-term success and ROI of the project.

### Card 17
**Front:**
What is the primary output of **Close Project or Phase**?

**Back:**
1. Final Product/Service/Result Transition.
2. Final Report.
3. Updates to OPAs.

### Card 18
**Front:**
**Scenario**: You are closing Phase 1 of a 3-Phase project. Do you release the team?

**Back:**
Likely **No** (unless specific skills aren't needed for Phase 2). But you DO archive Phase 1 records and do Phase 1 lessons learned.

### Card 19
**Front:**
What is **Regression Analysis** at closure?

**Back:**
Analyzing *why* performance varied from the plan to improve future estimates.

### Card 20
**Front:**
**Scenario**: A vendor claims they are owed more money due to a change. You disagree. What is this?

**Back:**
A **Claim** (or Dispute). It must be resolved (Negotiation -> ADR -> Litigation) before the contract can be closed.

---

##  Procurement Closure

### Card 21
**Front:**
What is **ADR**?

**Back:**
Alternative Dispute Resolution (Mediation or Arbitration). Used to settle claims without going to court.

### Card 22
**Front:**
Who usually handles **Contract Closure**?

**Back:**
The **Procurement Administrator** (Contract Manager). The PM ensures the work was done, but the Contract Manager signs the legal papers.

### Card 23
**Front:**
Can a project be closed with an **Open Claim**?

**Back:**
Generally **No**. The claim represents a financial liability. If it must be closed, the claim is typically transferred to the Legal department.

### Card 24
**Front:**
What is a **Procurement Audit**?

**Back:**
A review of the procurement process from Plan to Close. Goal: Identify successes and failures in the procurement process itself (Process Improvement).

### Card 25
**Front:**
What is **Negotiated Settlement**?

**Back:**
The preferred method for resolving claims. "Let's agree on a number and walk away."

### Card 26
**Front:**
What is **Early Termination** of a contract?

**Back:**
Ending a contract before the work is done. Usually requires a "Termination for Convenience" clause (Buyer pays for work done + profit/overhead).

### Card 27
**Front:**
**Scenario**: A Fixed Price vendor finished the work but lost money. They ask for more. Do you pay?

**Back:**
**No**. In Fixed Price, the seller carries the cost risk. (Unless there was a scope change).

### Card 28
**Front:**
**Scenario**: A Cost Reimbursable vendor finished under budget. Who keeps the savings?

**Back:**
The **Buyer** (usually), unless there is an Incentive Fee (CPIF) sharing ratio.

### Card 29
**Front:**
What document provides formal notice that the contract is complete?

**Back:**
**Notice of Completion** (or formal written notice of acceptance).

### Card 30
**Front:**
**True or False**: Procurement Closure is mandatory for every contract.

**Back:**
**True**. Even if it was a small purchase, you need a record that it was completed.

##  Lessons Learned & Knowledge Transfer

### Card 31
**Front:**
What is the difference between **Lessons Learned** and **Retrospective**?

**Back:**
-   **Retrospective**: Agile, end of Sprint, focuses on team *process* improvement for the next sprint.
-   **Lessons Learned**: Predictive/End of Project, focuses on broad *project* knowledge for the *organization*.

### Card 32
**Front:**
Should Lessons Learned be **Blameless**?

**Back:**
**Yes**. Focus on the process/problem, not the person. "We didn't catch the bug" vs "Bob writes bad code."

### Card 33
**Front:**
Who is the audience for the **Final Report**?

**Back:**
Stakeholders, Sponsor, Senior Management, and *Future Project Managers*.

### Card 34
**Front:**
What is **Explicit Knowledge**?

**Back:**
Knowledge that can be easily codified (Documents, Files, Databases).

### Card 35
**Front:**
What is **Tacit Knowledge**?

**Back:**
Knowledge that is difficult to transfer (Experience, Intuition, "Tribal Knowledge"). Requires mentoring/shadowing to transfer.

### Card 36
**Front:**
**Scenario**: The project was a disaster. The PM is embarrassed. Should they skip the Final Report?

**Back:**
**No**. Failures provide more learning value than successes. It is ethical and professional to document what went wrong.

### Card 37
**Front:**
What happens to the **Project Website** or **SharePoint**?

**Back:**
It is **Archived** (made read-only) or data is moved to a permanent repository.

### Card 38
**Front:**
What is the **PMIS** role in closure?

**Back:**
The Project Management Information System is updated to show the project status as "Closed" and files are archived within it.

### Card 39
**Front:**
**Scenario**: A team member wants to copy the code to a USB drive to "reuse it later." Is this okay?

**Back:**
**No**. It is Intellectual Property (IP) of the organization. Check company policy.

### Card 40
**Front:**
How do you measure **Customer Satisfaction** at closure?

**Back:**
Surveys, Interviews, Net Promoter Score (NPS).

##  Scenarios: The End of the Road

### Card 41
**Front:**
**Scenario**: The project delivered all scope, but the user refuses to use the system because "it's too hard." Is the project successful?

**Back:**
**Mixed**. Technical success, but **Business Failure** (Adoption failed). This implies a failure in *Stakeholder Engagement* or *Transition Planning*.

### Card 42
**Front:**
**Scenario**: You are closing a project. You realize a risk you identified never happened. What do you do?

**Back:**
Update the **Risk Register** to close the risk. The unused contingency reserve is returned to the company.

### Card 43
**Front:**
**Scenario**: The Sponsor resigns right before closure. Who accepts the project?

**Back:**
The **New Sponsor** (or interim authority). You absolutely need a signature.

### Card 44
**Front:**
**Scenario**: A project is terminated early for "Convenience." What is the PM's first administrative step?

**Back:**
Review the **Termination Clause** in contracts and the Project Charter for closure procedures.

### Card 45
**Front:**
**Scenario**: The Operations team says "We aren't ready to take this." What should the PM have done?

**Back:**
Involved Operations early in the project (**Stakeholder Engagement**) and created a **Transition Plan**.

### Card 46
**Front:**
**Scenario**: All tasks are done. The PM sets their "Out of Office" and leaves. What is missing?

**Back:**
**Formal Closure**. Archiving, Lessons Learned, Final Report. The project is "orphaned."

### Card 47
**Front:**
**Scenario**: You find a small defect during the Final Walkthrough. It doesn't stop operations.

**Back:**
Add it to the **Punch List** (Warranty item), get the customer to sign off on "Substantial Completion," and fix it during the warranty period.

### Card 48
**Front:**
What is **Sunk Cost**?

**Back:**
Money already spent. It should **not** influence the decision to continue or cancel a project (Sunk Cost Fallacy).

### Card 49
**Front:**
**Scenario**: The project saved $50k. Can the PM use it for a party?

**Back:**
**No**. It returns to the company/program budget. A celebration is a valid "Team Building" expense, but it must be reasonable and policy-compliant.

### Card 50
**Front:**
How does Agile "Close"?

**Back:**
Typically by retiring the backlog or funding stream. Artifacts like the Definition of Done ensures quality along the way, but a final "Retrospective" and knowledge transfer is still best practice.
