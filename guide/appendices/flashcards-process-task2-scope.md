**ECO Reference**: Process Task 2

---

##  Scope Fundamentals

### Card 1
**Front:**
What is the difference between **Product Scope** and **Project Scope**?

**Back:**
-   **Product Scope**: The features and functions of the product, service, or result (e.g., "The phone unlocks with FaceID").
-   **Project Scope**: The work performed to deliver the product (e.g., "Design the sensor, coding, testing, user manual").

### Card 2
**Front:**
What are the three components of the **Scope Baseline**?

**Back:**
1.  **Project Scope Statement**
2.  **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)**
3.  **WBS Dictionary**

### Card 3
**Front:**
What is **Gold Plating**?

**Back:**
The practice of adding extra features or functionality that were not requested by the customer or sponsor. It is considered **bad practice** as it wastes resources and adds risk.

### Card 4
**Front:**
What is **Scope Creep**?

**Back:**
The uncontrolled expansion to product or project scope without adjustments to time, cost, and resources. It typically happens when changes are accepted without formal Change Control.

### Card 5
**Front:**
What is the primary purpose of the **Scope Management Plan**?

**Back:**
It describes **how** the scope will be defined, developed, monitored, controlled, and validated. It is a "process" document, not the scope itself.

### Card 6
**Front:**
What is the **100% Rule** in WBS creation?

**Back:**
The WBS includes **100% of the work** defined by the project scope and captures all deliverables—internal, external, and interim. If it's not in the WBS, it's not in the project.

### Card 7
**Front:**
What is a **Work Package**?

**Back:**
The lowest level of the WBS modification. It is the point at which cost and activity durations are estimated and managed.

### Card 8
**Front:**
What is the **WBS Dictionary**?

**Back:**
A document that provides detailed deliverables, activities, and scheduling information about each component in the WBS. It explains the brief title found on the WBS chart.

### Card 9
**Front:**
What is a **Control Account**?

**Back:**
A management control point where scope, budget, actual cost, and schedule are integrated and compared to earned value for performance measurement.

### Card 10
**Front:**
What is the difference between **Validate Scope** and **Control Quality**?

**Back:**
-   **Control Quality**: Checking deliverables for **correctness** (defects) internally.
-   **Validate Scope**: Obtaining formal **acceptance** of the deliverables from the stakeholder/customer.

##  Collecting Requirements

### Card 11
**Front:**
What is the **Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM)**?

**Back:**
A grid that links product requirements from their origin (e.g., business need) to the deliverables that satisfy them. It helps ensure every requirement adds value.

### Card 12
**Front:**
What is distinct about a **Focus Group** versus a regular meeting?

**Back:**
A Focus Group uses a trained moderator to guide a prequalified group of stakeholders/SMEs through an interactive discussion to elicit attitudes and needs.

### Card 13
**Front:**
What is **Benchmarking**?

**Back:**
Comparing actual or planned practices (or requirements) to those of comparable projects or organizations to identify best practices and generate ideas.

### Card 14
**Front:**
What is the **Nominal Group Technique**?

**Back:**
A structured brainstorming method that prioritizes ideas by having participants vote. It prevents dominant personalities from swaying the group (unlike free-form brainstorming).

### Card 15
**Front:**
What is a **Context Diagram**?

**Back:**
A visual model that shows the boundaries of the product scope by depicting the business system and how people and other systems (actors) interact with it.

### Card 16
**Front:**
What are **Functional Requirements**?

**Back:**
Behaviors of the product. "The system shall do X." (e.g., "Send an email when order ships").

### Card 17
**Front:**
What are **Non-Functional Requirements**?

**Back:**
Attributes of the service or product performance. "The system shall be X." (e.g., Reliability, Security, Performance, Compliance).

### Card 18
**Front:**
What is **JAD (Joint Application Design)**?

**Back:**
A requirement collection technique where the development team and business stakeholders work together in intense workshops to define requirements (common in software).

### Card 19
**Front:**
What is **Document Analysis**?

**Back:**
Reviewing existing documentation (business plans, agreements, laws, legacy system docs) to elicit requirements without needing to interview people directly.

### Card 20
**Front:**
What is the difference between an **Affinity Diagram** and a **Mind Map**?

**Back:**
-   **Affinity Diagram**: Organizing large amounts of unorganized data into groups/themes (bottom-up).
-   **Mind Map**: Visualizing ideas branching out from a central concept (top-down/associative).

##  Agile Scope Management

### Card 21
**Front:**
In Agile, what replaces the detailed hierarchical WBS?

**Back:**
The **Product Backlog** (decomposed into Epics, Features, and User Stories).

### Card 22
**Front:**
What is the structure of a standard **User Story**?

**Back:**
"As a **[role]**, I want **[feature/action]**, so that **[benefit/value]**."

### Card 23
**Front:**
What are the **INVEST** criteria for good User Stories?

**Back:**

### Card 25
**Front:**
Who is ultimately responsible for managing the **Project Scope** in a predictive environment?

**Back:**
The **Project Manager**. (In Agile, the Product Owner manages the Product Scope/Backlog, but the Team manages the Sprint Scope).

### Card 26
**Front:**
What is a **Spike**?

**Back:**
A time-boxed investigation story used to explore a requirement or technical approach to reduce risk before committing to a solution.

### Card 27
**Front:**
How does Agile handle **Scope Change** during a Sprint?

**Back:**
Scope within a Sprint is generally fixed. New requests go to the **Product Backlog** for future prioritization. If a change is critical, the PO may terminate the sprint (extreme case).

### Card 28
**Front:**
What is **Velocity**?

**Back:**
A measure of the amount of work (in Story Points) a team can complete in a single iteration. It helps in forecasting future scope delivery.

### Card 29
**Front:**
What is the **Definition of Ready**?

**Back:**
The set of criteria that a User Story must meet (e.g., clear, small enough, testable) before it can be accepted into a Sprint.

### Card 30
**Front:**
What is **MoSCoW** prioritization?

**Back:**
-   **M**ust Have
-   **S**hould Have

##  Constraints & Assumptions

### Card 31
**Front:**
What is a **Constraint**?

**Back:**
A limiting factor that affects the execution of a project (e.g., fixed budget, hard deadline, mandatory regulation). It is a "Wall" you cannot move easily.

### Card 32
**Front:**
What is an **Assumption**?

**Back:**
A factor considered to be true for planning purposes without proof. If an assumption turns out to be false, it becomes a **Risk** or **Issue**.

### Card 33
**Front:**
Where should you document assumptions?

**Back:**
In the **Assumption Log**.

### Card 34
**Front:**
**Scenario**: You assumed a specific server would be available, but it crashed. The project is now delayed. Is this a Risk or an Issue?

**Back:**
It is an **Issue**. The uncertainty (Risk) has happened. You must now implement a workaround or change request.

### Card 35
**Front:**
How often should the **Assumption Log** be reviewed?

**Back:**
Regularly throughout the project. Assumptions should be validated (proven true) or identified as false (triggering risks) as the project progresses.

### Card 36
**Front:**
"The project must be completed by December 31st to meet regulatory compliance." Is this a constraint or assumption?

**Back:**
**Constraint**. It is an external limitation imposed on the project.

### Card 37
**Front:**
"We believe the vendor will deliver the hardware within 4 weeks." Is this a constraint or assumption?

**Back:**
**Assumption**. It is a belief that has not yet been validated.

### Card 38
**Front:**
What is **Constraint Optimization**?

**Back:**
The process of analyzing trade-offs (Scope vs. Time vs. Cost) to find the best solution when constraints conflict.

### Card 39
**Front:**
What is the **Assumption Analysis** technique?

**Back:**
A structured review of assumptions to test their validity and identify the risks associated with them being false.

### Card 40
**Front:**
How do **Enterprise Environmental Factors (EEFs)** act as constraints?

**Back:**
EEFs (like market conditions, government regulations, or existing infrastructure) limit the team's options and must be worked within.

##  Scenarios: Managing Scope

### Card 41
**Front:**
**Scenario**: A stakeholder asks for a "small change" directly to a developer. The developer initiates the work. What should the PM do?

**Back:**
Stop the work. Explain the **Change Control Process** to the stakeholder and the team member. Even small changes must be logged and analyzed to prevent scope creep.

### Card 42
**Front:**
**Scenario**: You are in the Validate Scope process, and the client rejects a deliverable because "it doesn't look right," although it meets all requirements. What do you do?

**Back:**
Document the rejection as an **Issue**. Compare the deliverable to the **Requirements** and **Acceptance Criteria**. If it meets them, negotiate or initiate a Change Request for the new design. If it doesn't, initiate Defect Repair.

### Card 43
**Front:**
**Scenario**: During a project phase, the team discovers a faster way to do the work that changes the technical approach but yields the same deliverable. Do you need a Change Request?

**Back:**
Usually **No**, provided the scope (deliverable), schedule, and cost baselines are not negatively affected. The "How" is often the team's domain; the "What" is the baseline.

### Card 44
**Front:**
**Scenario**: A sponsor demands a fixed deadline (Constraint). The team estimates the Scope will take 2 months longer than that deadline. What is your response?

**Back:**
Present **options**:
1.  Cut Scope (deliver MVP by deadline).
2.  Add Resources (Crash the schedule - increases Cost/Risk).
3.  Extend Deadline (reject the constraint).
Do **not** just agree to an impossible plan.

### Card 45
**Front:**
**Scenario**: You are using Agile. The Product Owner keeps adding stories to the active Sprint. The team is burning out. What do you do?

**Back:**
As a Servant Leader (Scrum Master), protect the team. Remind the PO that the **Sprint Scope is fixed** to ensure focus. New items go to the Backlog for the *next* sprint.

### Card 46
**Front:**
**Scenario**: You discover that a "Must Have" requirement was missed in the WBS. The project is in execution. What do you do?

**Back:**
Submit a **Change Request**. You cannot just add it; you must analyze the impact on Schedule and Cost and get approval to update the baselines.

### Card 47
**Front:**
**Scenario**: A team member adds a cool animation to the app that wasn't in the design because "it took only 2 hours." How do you handle this?

**Back:**
Address it as **Gold Plating**. Explain that while well-intentioned, unauthorized features introduce maintenance costs and bugs. It should be removed or formally approved.

### Card 48
**Front:**
**Scenario**: Your Requirement Traceability Matrix shows a requirement that is not linked to any WBS element or test case. What does this mean?

**Back:**
You have a **Gap**. A requirement was approved but is not being built or tested. You need to update the WBS/Plan to include it (or remove the requirement if it's invalid).

### Card 49
**Front:**
**Scenario**: The WBS has 6 levels of decomposition, and the team is confused by the micromanagement. What happened?

**Back:**
**Excessive Decomposition**. The WBS should only go down to the Work Package level (managable chunks, e.g., 8-80 hours). Too much detail paralyzes the team.

### Card 50
**Front:**
**Scenario**: You are gathering requirements for a global tool. One region dominates the conversation. How do you ensure balanced scope?

**Back:**
Use **Facilitation Techniques** (like round-robin voting or surveys) to ensure quiet stakeholders are heard. Avoid "Groupthink" or bias towards the loudest voice.

What is the key **Output** of the "Create WBS" process?

**Back:**
The **Scope Baseline**.

### Card 52
**Front:**
What is **Decomposition**?

**Back:**
The technique of subdividing project deliverables into smaller, more manageable components until the work and deliverables are defined to the **Work Package** level.

### Card 53
**Front:**
What is **Variance Analysis** in the context of Control Scope?

**Back:**
Comparing the **baseline** scope to the **actual** work completed to determine the magnitude of difference and decide if corrective action is needed.

**Front:**
What is the difference between the **Project Charter** and the **Project Scope Statement**?

**Back:**
-   **Charter**: High-level intent, authorized by Sponsor.
-   **Scope Statement**: Detailed description of deliverables, exclusions, and acceptance criteria, created by the Team during planning.

### Card 55
**Front:**
What is an **Exclusion** in the Scope Statement?

**Back:**
A clear statement of what is **NOT** included in the project. This manages expectations and prevents scope creep.

### Card 56
**Front:**
In Agile, what is a **User Story Map** useful for?

**Back:**
It visualizes the journey of a user and helps arrange stories into **Releases** or versions based on value and priority.

### Card 57
**Front:**

**Front:**
What is **Acceptance Criteria**?

**Back:**
A set of conditions that is required to be met before deliverables are accepted. They are specific to each work package or user story.

### Card 59
**Front:**
What is the **Definition of Done (DoD)**?

**Back:**

##  Executing Work & Scope

### Card 61
**Front:**
What is a **Work Authorization System**?

**Back:**
A subsystem (in predictive projects) used to ensure that work is done at the right time and in the right sequence. It prevents "Cowboy Coding" or working out of order.

### Card 62
**Front:**
How does **Direct and Manage Project Work** relate to Scope?

**Back:**
This is the process where the team actually **executes the WBS**. The PM ensures only approved work (Scope Baseline) is being performed.

### Card 63
**Front:**
What is the role of **Tacit Knowledge** in executing scope?

**Back:**
Sharing "know-how" and experience (via pairing or shadowing) helps the team deliver complex scope that might not be fully documented in written specs.

### Card 64
**Front:**
What happens to a **Risk** when it occurs during execution?

**Back:**
It becomes an **Issue**. You must execute the response plan and update the Issue Log.

### Card 65
**Front:**
Who is responsible for **Executing** the scope in an Agile team?

**Back:**
The **Development Team** (Developers). They self-organize to turn the backlog items into a potentially shippable increment.

### Card 66
**Front:**
What is the **Daily Standup**'s role in scope management?

**Back:**
It coordinates the day's work to ensure the team remains focused on the **Sprint Goal** (the scope commitment for that iteration).

### Card 67
**Front:**
When does the client formally accept the scope deliverables?

**Back:**
During the **Validate Scope** process (Predictive) or the **Sprint Review** (Agile).

### Card 68
**Front:**
What is the difference between "Work Performance **Data**" and "**Information**"?

**Back:**
-   **Data**: Raw facts (e.g., "3 stories completed").
-   **Information**: Contextualized analysis (e.g., "We are 2 stories behind planned velocity").

### Card 69
**Front:**
What is **Managed Project Knowledge**?

**Back:**
The process of using existing knowledge and creating new knowledge to achieve the project's objectives and contribute to organizational learning.

### Card 70
**Front:**
What is the **Issue Log**?

**Back:**
A document where you track problems (that have already happened) and their resolution status. It is a key tool during execution.

##  Quick-Fire Scope Review

### Card 71
**Front:**
**True or False**: The WBS should be organized by time/phases only.

**Back:**
**False**. It can be organized by Phases, Deliverables, or Sub-projects. Deliverable-based is often preferred to focus on outcomes.

### Card 72
**Front:**
**True or False**: Agile teams do not use a WBS.

**Back:**
**True-ish**. They don't usually use a traditional WBS chart, but the **Decomposition** of Epics -> Features -> Stories -> Tasks is functionally the same concept.

### Card 73
**Front:**
**True or False**: The Project Scope Statement is part of the Scope Baseline.

**Back:**
**True**. Along with WBS and WBS Dictionary.

### Card 74
**Front:**
**True or False**: You should validate scope only at the very end of the project.

**Back:**
**False**. Validate scope at the end of every phase or sprint to ensure you don't build the wrong thing for months.

### Card 75
**Front:**
**True or False**: Adding "just a little" extra value for free is good project management.

**Back:**
**False**. That is **Gold Plating**. It bypasses change control and introduces risk.

### Card 76
**Front:**
What is **Rolling Wave Planning** in relation to Scope?

**Back:**
You detail the WBS for the near term (Work Packages) but leave future work at a high level (Planning Packages) until more info is known.

### Card 77
**Front:**
What do you call a WBS element that is used for cost control but not yet detailed enough to be a Work Package?

**Back:**
A **Planning Package**.

### Card 78
**Front:**
What is the hierarchy of Agile scope items?

**Back:**
Theme -> Epic -> Feature -> User Story -> Task.

### Card 79
**Front:**
What is the specific technique used to break down the project scope?

**Back:**
**Decomposition**.

### Card 80
**Front:**
Who approves the Scope Baseline?

**Back:**
The **Sponsor** and key stakeholders (and the PM). It is a mutual agreement.

---

##  Closing Scope

### Card 81
**Front:**
When is scope validation performed?

**Back:**
Throughout the project (iteratively), but formally at the end of each phase/sprint and at the end of the project.

### Card 82
**Front:**
If a project is terminated early, do you still do Validate Scope?

**Back:**
**Yes**. You must determine the level of completion and acceptance of whatever was finished up to that point.

### Card 83
**Front:**
What is the output of Validate Scope?

**Back:**
**Accepted Deliverables** and Work Performance Information.

### Card 84
**Front:**
How does Scope relate to Procurement?

**Back:**
The **Statement of Work (SOW)** in a contract is essentially the Scope Statement for the vendor.

### Card 85
**Front:**
What happens if the WBS is not complete?

**Back:**
The project cannot be accurately estimated (Cost/Schedule) or controlled. " If it's not in the WBS, it's not in the project."

### Card 86
**Front:**
Can a Requirement be in the RTM but not the WBS?

**Back:**
**No**. If it's a requirement, work must be done to deliver it. That work must be in the WBS. If they don't match, you have a gap.

### Card 87
**Front:**
What is **Regression Testing**?

**Back:**
Testing to ensure that new code/scope changes didn't break existing functionality. Essential in Agile scope management.

### Card 88
**Front:**
What is **Iterative Life Cycle** scope management?

**Back:**
Scope is determined early, but time and cost estimates are modified as the team understands the product better through iterations.

### Card 89
**Front:**
What is **Incremental Life Cycle** scope management?

**Back:**
The deliverable is produced through a series of iterations that successively add functionality within a predetermined time frame.

### Card 90
**Front:**
What is a **Change Control Board (CCB)**?

**Back:**
A formally chartered group responsible for reviewing, evaluating, approving, delaying, or rejecting changes to the project (including scope).
