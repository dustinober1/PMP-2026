# ⚡ Process Task 5: Plan and Manage Procurement

**Domain**: Process
**Task**: Plan and manage procurement
**ECO Reference**: Process Task 5

---

## 📜 Contract Types & Rationale

### Card 1
**Front:**
Which contract type places the most risk on the **Seller**?

**Back:**
**Firm Fixed Price (FFP)**. The seller is obligated to complete the work for a set price, regardless of their actual costs.

### Card 2
**Front:**
Which contract type places the most risk on the **Buyer**?

**Back:**
**Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF)** (or Cost Reimbursable). The buyer pays all allowables costs plus a profit fee; if costs spiral, the buyer pays.

### Card 3
**Front:**
When is a **Time and Materials (T&M)** contract most appropriate?

**Back:**
When the scope is not well defined at the start, but resources are needed quickly (e.g., Staff Augmentation or hiring experts for a short period).

### Card 4
**Front:**
What is a **Fixed Price Incentive Fee (FPIF)** contract?

**Back:**
A fixed-price contract that includes financial incentives for achieving specific metrics (e.g., finishing early or under budget). It has a price ceiling.

### Card 5
**Front:**
What is the **Point of Total Assumption (PTA)**?

**Back:**
The cost point in an FPIF contract where the seller assumes 100% of the cost overruns.
*Formula: Target Cost + ((Ceiling Price - Target Price) / Buyer's Share Ratio).*

### Card 6
**Front:**
What does **CR** stand for in contracts?

**Back:**
**Cost Reimbursable**. The seller is reimbursed for actual costs plus a fee representing profit.

### Card 7
**Front:**
What is a **Cost Plus Award Fee (CPAF)** contract?

**Back:**
A contract where the seller is reimbursed for costs, but the profit (fee) is based on subjective performance criteria defined by the buyer. The award amount is usually not subject to appeals.

### Card 8
**Front:**
**Scenario**: You are buying standard bolts for a construction project. The market price is stable. Which contract type do you use?

**Back:**
**Fixed Price**. Specifically, a Purchase Order (PO) is common for commodities.

### Card 9
**Front:**
**Scenario**: You are hiring a vendor to invent a new, never-before-seen technology. The scope is vague. Which contract type minimizes vendor bankruptcy risk?

**Back:**
**Cost Reimbursable (CR)**. A vendor would likely refuse a Fixed Price contract for undefined R&D work due to excessive risk.

### Card 10
**Front:**
What is a **Ceiling Price**?

**Back:**
The maximum amount the buyer will pay in a Fixed Price Incentive Fee (FPIF) contract. Any cost above this is borne entirely by the seller.

## 🛒 Sourcing & Selection

### Card 11
**Front:**
What is the purpose of a **Bidder Conference**?

**Back:**
To ensure all prospective sellers have a clear and common understanding of the procurement requirements (SOW). It ensures fairness.

### Card 12
**Front:**
**Scenario**: At a Bidder Conference, one vendor asks a question. What must you do with the answer?

**Back:**
Provide the answer to **all** potential vendors, not just the one who asked. This ensures a level playing field.

### Card 13
**Front:**
What is the **Make-or-Buy Analysis**?

**Back:**
A technique used to determine whether work should be accomplished by the project team or purchased from outside sources.

### Card 14
**Front:**
What are **Source Selection Criteria**?

**Back:**
The standards used to rate or score seller proposals (e.g., Price, Technical Approach, Experience, Financial Stability).

### Card 15
**Front:**
What describes the work to be done by the seller in detail?

**Back:**
The **Procurement Statement of Work (SOW)**.

### Card 16
**Front:**
What is a **Request for Proposal (RFP)**?

**Back:**
A procurement document used to solicit proposals from prospective sellers when the solution is not strictly defined (Buyer focuses on the problem; Seller proposes solution).

### Card 17
**Front:**
What is a **Request for Quotation (RFQ)**?

**Back:**
A procurement document used when the discussion is mostly about price (e.g., commodities, standard hours).

### Card 18
**Front:**
What is a **Sole Source** procurement?

**Back:**
When there is only one qualified seller in the market (e.g., owning a patent), so no competition is possible.

### Card 19
**Front:**
What is **Single Source** procurement?

**Back:**
Choosing to use a specific seller even though others exist (e.g., for consistency or previous relationship), usually requiring justification.

### Card 20
**Front:**
What is a **Screening System**?

**Back:**
A selection method that establishes minimum requirements (e.g., "Must be ISO certified"). Vendors who fail are disqualified immediately before further scoring.

---

## 🤝 Negotiation & Agreements

### Card 21
**Front:**
What is the primary goal of procurement **Negotiation**?

**Back:**
To reach a fair agreement that establishes a good working relationship (**Win-Win**), not to squeeze every penny out of the vendor.

### Card 22
**Front:**
Who typically leads the negotiation on the buyer's side?

**Back:**
The **Procurement Manager** (or Contract Administrator), not the Project Manager. The PM provides technical support and clarification.

### Card 23
**Front:**
What is **Privity of Contract**?

**Back:**
A legal concept meaning a contractual relationship exists only between the parties who signed the contract. (e.g., You cannot sue the subcontractor of your contractor directly if you don't have a contract with them).

### Card 24
**Front:**
What is a **Teaming Agreement**?

**Back:**
A legal agreement between two or more entities to form a partnership or joint venture for a specific opportunity (often before bidding).

### Card 25
**Front:**
What is **Constructive Change**?

**Back:**
When the buyer's actions or inactions (e.g., frequent interference, unapproved instructions) effectively change the contract scope, potentially entitling the seller to a claim.

### Card 26
**Front:**
What is **Force Majeure**?

**Back:**
A common contract clause that frees both parties from liability/obligation when an extraordinary event (Act of God, war, pandemic) prevents performance.

### Card 27
**Front:**
What is an **SLA (Service Level Agreement)**?

**Back:**
A contract component defining specific measurable metrics (e.g., 99.9% uptime, 4-hour response time) and penalties for missing them.

### Card 28
**Front:**
**Scenario**: The vendor says "Handshake deal?" What do you do?

**Back:**
**Get it in writing**. In PMP, if it's not written in the contract, it doesn't exist. Informal agreements are unenforceable and risky.

### Card 29
**Front:**
What is **Retainage**?

**Back:**
A portion of the contract price withheld until the work is substantially complete to ensure the vendor finishes the job.

### Card 30
**Front:**
Does a contract supersede the Project Charter?

**Back:**
**Yes**, for the work defined in that contract. It is a legally binding document.

## 🚧 Control Procurements

### Card 31
**Front:**
What is **Control Procurements**?

**Back:**
The process of managing procurement relationships, monitoring contract performance, and making changes and corrections as appropriate.

### Card 32
**Front:**
What is a **Claims Administration** process?

**Back:**
The process of processing, adjudicating, and communicating contract claims (disputes). It is the method for handling disagreements on compensation/scope.

### Card 33
**Front:**
What is the preferred method for resolving claims/disputes?

**Back:**
**Negotiation** (Direct usually). If that fails, then Mediation -> Arbitration -> Litigation (Court).

### Card 34
**Front:**
What is an **Inspection** (Procurement)?

**Back:**
A structured review of the work being performed by the contractor to ensure it meets the SOW specifications.

### Card 35
**Front:**
What is an **Audit** (Procurement)?

**Back:**
A structured review of the procurement *process* itself (e.g., "Are invoices being paid on time?", "Are we following the change control process?").

### Card 36
**Front:**
**Scenario**: The vendor delivers a product that doesn't meet the SOW specs but is "good enough." What do you do?

**Back:**
**Reject it** or issue a **Change Request**. Do not informally accept non-conforming work, as it sets a bad precedent and creates liability.

### Card 37
**Front:**
**Scenario**: You want to change the scope of a Fixed Price contract. What must happen?

**Back:**
A formal **Contract Change Order** (Amendment). This usually involves re-negotiating the price and schedule to account for the new scope.

### Card 38
**Front:**
What is **Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR)**?

**Back:**
Methods like Mediation and Arbitration used to resolve disputes without going to the expensive and damaging process of Litigation (Court).

### Card 39
**Front:**
What is **Trend Analysis** in procurement?

**Back:**

## 🚦 Closing Procurements

### Card 41
**Front:**
What is the key output of closing a procurement?

**Back:**
**Closed Procurements** (Formal notice that the contract is complete).

### Card 42
**Front:**
Can a project be closed if there are open claims with a vendor?

**Back:**
Generally **No**. Procurement closure usually happens before or as part of project/phase closure. Claims must be resolved or actively handed over to legal.

### Card 43
**Front:**
What is **Formal Acceptance**?

**Back:**
Written confirmation from the buyer that the deliverables meet the requirements. It is often a prerequisite for final payment.

### Card 44
**Front:**
Why capture **Lessons Learned** from a vendor relationship?

**Back:**
To update the organization's vendor list (OPAs). Helps future PMs know if this vendor is reliable or problematic.

### Card 45
**Front:**
**Scenario**: The project is cancelled early. What happens to the contracts?

**Back:**
They enter the **Close Procurements** process immediately. You must follow the termination clauses (e.g., paying for work done to date).

### Card 46
**Front:**
What is an **Records Management System**?

**Back:**
A set of processes and tools to consolidate and archive contract documents, correspondence, and artifacts for future reference/legal protection.

### Card 47
**Front:**
**Scenario**: The vendor has finished the work. You are happy. Can you just pay the final invoice?

**Back:**
Not yet. You must perform **Formal Acceptance** (verify SOW is met) and check that no claims are open before authorizing final payment.

### Card 48
**Front:**
What distinguishes **Mediation** from **Arbitration**?

**Back:**
-   **Mediation**: Non-binding. A third party helps facilitate a solution.
-   **Arbitration**: Binding. A third party hears both sides and *makes a decision*.

### Card 49
**Front:**
What is **Warranty** administration?

**Back:**
Ensuring that the seller corrects defects found during the warranty period, even after the initial project acceptance.

### Card 50
**Front:**
Is "Closing Procurements" a separate process in the current ECO?

**Back:**
It's often integrated into **Control Procurements** or Project Closure, but the *activities* (audit, file, acceptance) remain critical.

## ⚡ Quick-Fire Procurement Review

### Card 51
**Front:**
**True or False**: The PM should try to get the lowest possible price from the vendor to save the budget.

**Back:**
**False**. A price that is too low may force the vendor to cut corners or fail. Aim for **Fair and Reasonable** price.

### Card 52
**Front:**
**True or False**: If a vendor violates a contract term, you should immediately sue them.

**Back:**
**False**. Use the **Cure Notice** process first—give them a chance to fix the issue before terminating.

### Card 53
**Front:**
**True or False**: Independent cost estimates act as a reality check on vendor bids.

**Back:**
**True**. If all bids are much higher than your estimate, your SOW might be unclear or your budget unrealistic.

### Card 54
**Front:**
**True or False**: In Agile, we prefer "Contract Negotiation over Customer Collaboration."

**Back:**
**False**. Agile Manifesto values **Customer Collaboration OVER Contract Negotiation**.

### Card 55
**Front:**
What is a **Time is of the Essence** clause?

**Back:**
A legal phrase meaning that delays will be considered a material breach of contract (Late delivery = Breach).

### Card 56
**Front:**
What is **Liquidated Damages**?

**Back:**
Pre-agreed financial penalties (e.g., $1000 per day late) defined in the contract for failure to meet specific targets.

### Card 57
**Front:**
Who owns the IP (Intellectual Property) created during a contract?

**Back:**
It depends on the **Contract Clauses**. Always define who owns the code/design: the buyer or the seller.

### Card 58
**Front:**
What is the risk of a **Cost Plus Percentage of Cost (CPPC)** contract?

**Back:**
It incentivizes the seller to increase costs (to get a bigger percentage fee). It is explicitly forbidden in US Federal contracting.

### Card 59
**Front:**
**Scenario**: The vendor's PM and your PM agree on a scope change over lunch. Implementation starts. Valid?

**Back:**
**No**. Unless they have specific authority and document it as a formal change, this is **unauthorized**.

### Card 60
**Front:**
What is **Letter of Intent (LOI)**?

**Back:**
A document stating intent to sign a contract. It allows some work to start but is **not** usually a binding contract for the full scope.

## 🧠 Advanced Procurement Concepts

### Card 61
**Front:**
What is **Agile Procurement**?

**Back:**
Collaborative contracting where the scope is flexible (e.g., T&M or Fixed-Price per Sprint) and the focus is on team capability rather than a fixed deliverable list.

### Card 62
**Front:**
What is a **Master Services Agreement (MSA)**?

**Back:**
An overarching contract that defines general terms (NDA, payment, liability) between parties, allowing for quicker **Statements of Work (SOW)** for specific projects.

### Card 63
**Front:**
What is **Vendor Lock-in**?

**Back:**
A risk where you become dependent on a single vendor's proprietary technology, making it expensive or impossible to switch later.

### Card 64
**Front:**
What is **Weighting Systems** in source selection?

**Back:**
Assigning numerical weights to evaluation criteria (e.g., Cost=50, Quality=50) to remove bias and objectively pick the best seller.

### Card 65
**Front:**
What is a **Performance Bond**?

**Back:**
A financial guarantee (insurance) ensuring the seller will complete the work. If they fail, the bond pays the buyer.

### Card 66
**Front:**
What is **Privity**?

**Back:**
The legal relationship between the parties to a contract. (Same as preivous card, reinforcing important term).

### Card 67
**Front:**
What is **Evaluation Criteria**?

**Back:**
The "ruler" used to measure proposals. Must be objective and clearly defined in the RFP.

### Card 68
**Front:**
What is **Prompt Payment Act**?

**Back:**
Regulations (in many jurisdictions) requiring buyers to pay valid invoices within a specific time (e.g., 30 days) or pay interest.

### Card 69
**Front:**
What is **Breach of Contract**?

**Back:**
Failure to perform any promise that forms all or part of the contract without legal excuse.

### Card 70
**Front:**
**Scenario**: A vendor goes bankrupt in the middle of the project. What do you do?

**Back:**
Consult legal immediately. Secure the work-in-progress. Look for bond protections. Initiate contingency plan (alternate vendor).

## 🔢 Calculation Practice

### Card 71
**Front:**
**Calculate PTA**: Target Cost = 100k, Target Price = 110k, Ceiling = 130k, Buyer Share = 80%.

**Back:**
PTA = 100k + ((130k - 110k) / 0.8) = 100k + (20k / 0.8) = 100k + 25k = **125k**.

### Card 72
**Front:**
**Calculate Fee (CPIF)**: Target Cost = 100k, Target Fee = 10k, Share = 50/50. Actual Cost = 80k.

**Back:**
Under budget by 20k. Seller share = 50% of 20k = 10k.
Total Fee = Target Fees (10k) + Incentive (10k) = **20k**.

### Card 73
**Front:**
**Calculate Final Price (CPIF)**: Using above numbers.

**Back:**
Actual Cost (80k) + Final Fee (20k) = **100k**.

### Card 74
**Front:**
**Calculate Fee (CPIF)**: Target Cost = 100k, Target Fee = 10k, Share = 50/50. Actual Cost = 110k.

**Back:**
Over budget by 10k. Seller pays 50% of 10k = 5k.
Total Fee = Target Fee (10k) - Penalty (5k) = **5k**.

### Card 75
**Front:**
**Calculate Fee (FPIF)**: Target Cost = 50k, Target Fee = 5k, Share = 60/40. Ceiling = 70k. Actual Cost = 80k.

**Back:**
Wait! Actual Cost (80k) > Ceiling (70k). The Buyer pays **70k** max. The fee calculation is irrelevant because the ceiling was breached. Seller loses money.

### Card 76
**Front:**
What does the acronym **IFB** stand for?

**Back:**
**Invitation for Bid** (Used when price is the main factor).

### Card 77
**Front:**
What is **Source Selection**?

**Back:**
The process of evaluating proposals and choosing the vendor.

### Card 78
**Front:**
Does **Procurement Audits** happen in Closing or Executing?

**Back:**
Originally Closing, but modernly part of **Control Procurements** and Closing. It reviews the *process* success.

### Card 79
**Front:**
What is the **Records Management System**?

**Back:**
Specific set of processes, related control functions, and tools that are consolidated and combined to record and retain information about the project.

### Card 80
**Front:**
What is **Negotiated Settlements**?

**Back:**
The final equitable settlement of all outstanding issues, claims, and disputes by process of negotiation.
