## 💰 Cost Planning Fundamentals

### Card 1
**Front:**
What is the **Cost Baseline**?

**Back:**
The approved version of the time-phased project budget, excluding any management reserves, which can only be changed through formal change control procedures.

### Card 2
**Front:**
What is the difference between **Contingency Reserve** and **Management Reserve**?

**Back:**
-   **Contingency Reserve**: For "Known Unknowns" (Identified risks). Included in the Cost Baseline. Controlled by the PM.
-   **Management Reserve**: For "Unknown Unknowns" (Unforeseen risks). *Not* in the Baseline. Controlled by the Sponsor.

### Card 3
**Front:**
What is **Cost Aggregation**?

**Back:**
Summing the lower-level cost estimates (work packages) to higher levels (control accounts) and finally to the entire project to create the budget.

### Card 4
**Front:**
What is **Funding Limit Reconciliation**?

**Back:**
The process of comparing the planned expenditure of project funds against any limits on the commitment of funds for the project to determine if there are any variances between the funding limits and the planned costs.

### Card 5
**Front:**
What is a **Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM)** estimate?

**Back:**
A high-level estimate made early in the project with a wide range of accuracy (typically -25% to +75%).

### Card 6
**Front:**
What is **Parametric Estimating**?

**Back:**
Using a statistical relationship between historical data and other variables (e.g., square footage) to calculate an estimate. (e.g., $200 per sq ft * 2000 sq ft = $400,000).

### Card 7
**Front:**
What is **Analogous Estimating**?

**Back:**
Using the actual cost of a previous, similar project as the basis for estimating the cost of the current project. It uses "expert judgment" and is less accurate.

### Card 8
**Front:**
What is **Bottom-Up Estimating**?

**Back:**
Estimating the cost of individual work packages or activities with the greatest level of detail and then rolling them up to higher levels. It is the most accurate but time-consuming.

### Card 9
**Front:**
What is **Value Engineering**?

**Back:**
An approach used to optimize project life cycle costs, save time, increase profits, improve quality, expand market share, solve problems, and/or use resources more effectively. (Getting the same function for less cost).

### Card 10
**Front:**
What are **Direct Costs** vs. **Indirect Costs**?

**Back:**
-   **Direct**: Expenses directly attributed to project work (e.g., team travel, materials).
-   **Indirect**: Overhead expenses shared across projects (e.g., electricity, janitorial services, executive salaries).

## 📈 Earned Value Management (EVM) Formulas

### Card 11
**Front:**
What is **PV (Planned Value)**?

**Back:**
The authorized budget assigned to scheduled work. (What we *should* have done by now, in dollar terms).

### Card 12
**Front:**
What is **EV (Earned Value)**?

**Back:**
The measure of work performed expressed in terms of the budget authorized for that work. (What we *actually* accomplished, in dollar terms).

### Card 13
**Front:**
What is **AC (Actual Cost)**?

**Back:**
The realized cost incurred for the work performed on an activity during a specific time period. (What we *actually* spent).

### Card 14
**Front:**
What is the formula for **Cost Variance (CV)**?

**Back:**
CV = EV - AC.
(Negative is bad/over budget; Positive is good/under budget).

### Card 15
**Front:**
What is the formula for **Schedule Variance (SV)**?

**Back:**
SV = EV - PV.
(Negative is bad/behind schedule; Positive is good/ahead of schedule).

### Card 16
**Front:**
What is the formula for **Cost Performance Index (CPI)**?

**Back:**
CPI = EV / AC.
(Below 1.0 is bad/over budget; Above 1.0 is good/under budget).

### Card 17
**Front:**
What is the formula for **Schedule Performance Index (SPI)**?

**Back:**
SPI = EV / PV.
(Below 1.0 is bad/behind schedule; Above 1.0 is good/ahead of schedule).

### Card 18
**Front:**
**Scenario**: CPI = 0.8. Interpret this.

**Back:**
For every $1.00 spent, the project is only getting $0.80 worth of work. The project is **Over Budget**.

### Card 19
**Front:**
**Scenario**: SPI = 1.1. Interpret this.

**Back:**
The project is progressing at 110% of the planned rate. The project is **Ahead of Schedule**.

### Card 20
**Front:**
What is **BAC (Budget at Completion)**?

**Back:**
The sum of all budgets established for the work to be performed (The total Cost Baseline).

---

## 🔮 Forecasting (EAC, ETC, TCPI)

### Card 21
**Front:**
What is **EAC (Estimate at Completion)**?

**Back:**
The expected total cost of completing all work expressed as the sum of the actual cost to date and the estimate to complete. (What we think the total bill will be at the end).

### Card 22
**Front:**
What is the EAC formula if **current variances are typical** and expected to continue?

**Back:**
EAC = BAC / CPI.

### Card 23
**Front:**
What is the EAC formula if the variance was **atypical** (a one-time event) and future work will be on plan?

**Back:**
EAC = AC + (BAC - EV).

### Card 24
**Front:**
What is **ETC (Estimate to Complete)**?

**Back:**
The expected cost to finish all the remaining project work.
Formula: ETC = EAC - AC.

### Card 25
**Front:**
What is **VAC (Variance at Completion)**?

**Back:**
A projection of the amount of budget deficit or surplus, expressed as the difference between the budget at completion and the estimate at completion.
Formula: VAC = BAC - EAC.

### Card 26
**Front:**
What is **TCPI (To-Complete Performance Index)**?

**Back:**
A measure of the cost performance effectiveness that must be achieved on the remaining work to meet a specified management goal (BAC or EAC).

### Card 27
**Front:**
What is the TCPI formula to meet the **original budget (BAC)**?

**Back:**
TCPI = (BAC - EV) / (BAC - AC).
(Work Remaining / Funds Remaining).

### Card 28
**Front:**
**Scenario**: TCPI is 1.2. Interpret this.

**Back:**
The team must complete the remaining work at a cost efficiency of 1.2 (getting $1.20 of value for every $1.00 spent) to hit the budget. This is difficult/aggressive.

### Card 29
**Front:**
**Scenario**: Your SPI is 0.7 and your CPI is 1.1. What is the status?

**Back:**
The project is **Behind Schedule** but **Under Budget**. (Maybe you haven't hired enough people yet).

### Card 30
**Front:**
**Scenario**: Which index is the most critical for forecasting the final project cost?

**Back:**
**CPI (Cost Performance Index)**. It is historically the most stable predictor of final costs.

## 🧠 Scenarios: Financial Management

### Card 31
**Front:**
**Scenario**: You identify a new risk that was not previously known. Mitigation costs $10k. Where do you get the money?

**Back:**
Ask the Sponsor to use the **Management Reserve**. Since it was an "Unknown Unknown," it requires a change request to move money into the baseline.

### Card 32
**Front:**
**Scenario**: A risk identified in the Risk Register occurs (price of steel goes up). Mitigation costs $5k. Where do you get the money?

**Back:**
Use the **Contingency Reserve**. This is under your (PM) authority and is already part of the Cost Baseline.

### Card 33
**Front:**
**Scenario**: The project is 50% complete. You have spent 70% of the budget. What is likely true about your CPI?

**Back:**
CPI is likely **< 1.0**. You have spent more than you have earned.

### Card 34
**Front:**
**Scenario**: Your project funding is cut by 10% mid-project. What do you do?

**Back:**
Evaluate the impact on Scope, Schedule, and Quality. You must likely **reduce scope** or **reschedule** work. You cannot just "try harder."

### Card 35
**Front:**
**Scenario**: The CFO asks for a cash flow forecast for next month. What document helps you?

**Back:**
The **Cost Baseline** (specifically the time-phased budget or S-Curve), typically reconciled with **Funding Limits**.

### Card 36
**Front:**
**Scenario**: You are using a **Fixed Price** contract. The vendor's costs double. Does this affect your CPI?

**Back:**
**No**. In FFP, the price is set. The vendor absorbs the cost overrun. Your AC remains what you pay them (the fixed price).

### Card 37
**Front:**
**Scenario**: You need to buy a server. Option A: $5k, lasts 2 years. Option B: $8k, lasts 5 years. Which analysis helps you decide?

**Back:**
**Lifecycle Costing** (or Total Cost of Ownership). Option B is cheaper per year ($1.6k/yr vs $2.5k/yr).

### Card 38
**Front:**
**Scenario**: Your project is cancelled. You spent $2M. Expected value was $10M. Should you finish just to "save" the $2M investment?

**Back:**
**No**. That is the **Sunk Cost Fallacy**. Decisions should be based on future value vs. future cost only.

### Card 39
**Front:**
**Scenario**: During a status meeting, a stakeholder asks "How much money do we have left?" Which variance tells them?

**Back:**
Technically **Funds Remaining** (BAC - AC), but **ETC** (Estimate to Complete) tells them how much *more* you need.

### Card 40
**Front:**
**Scenario**: Your Sponsor asks, "Will we finish on budget?" Which metric answers this?

**Back:**
**VAC (Variance at Completion)**. If positive, Yes. If negative, No.

## 🛠️ ITTOs of Cost Management

### Card 41
**Front:**
What is the **Cost Management Plan**?

**Back:**
A component of the project management plan that describes how costs will be planned, structured, and controlled (e.g., units of measure, control thresholds).

### Card 42
**Front:**
What is an **S-Curve**?

**Back:**
A graph displaying cumulative costs over a specific time period. It usually creates an 'S' shape (slow start, rapid execution, slow finish).

### Card 43
**Front:**
What are **Control Thresholds**?

**Back:**
Variance amounts (e.g., +/- 10%) defined in the Cost Management Plan. If performance passes the threshold, a report or action is required.

### Card 44
**Front:**
What is the **Basis of Estimates**?

**Back:**
Supporting documentation outlining the details used in establishing project estimates (assumptions, constraints, level of confidence, method used).

### Card 45
**Front:**
What is **Cost of Quality (COQ)**?

**Back:**
All costs incurred over the life of the product by investment in preventing nonconformance to requirements, appraising the product, and failing to meet requirements (Rework).

### Card 46
**Front:**
What is **Triangular Distribution** in 3-Point Estimating?

**Back:**
Simple average: (Optimistic + Most Likely + Pessimistic) / 3.

### Card 47
**Front:**
What is **Beta Distribution** (PERT) in 3-Point Estimating?

**Back:**
Weighted average: (Optimistic + 4(Most Likely) + Pessimistic) / 6. (More weight on the "Most Likely").

### Card 48
**Front:**
What are **Exchange Rate** fluctuations regarded as?

**Back:**
An **Enterprise Environmental Factor (EEF)**. On international projects, this is a risk requiring reserve.

### Card 49
**Front:**
Why is **Work Performance Data** an input to Control Costs?

**Back:**
It contains the raw data (e.g., costs incurred, status of activities) needed to calculate CV, SV, CPI, and SPI.

### Card 50
**Front:**
What is **Depreciation**?

**Back:**
The allocation of the cost of a tangible asset over its useful life. Only relevant if the project involves capitalization of assets.

## ⚡ Quick-Fire Cost Review

### Card 51
**Front:**
**True or False**: The Project Manager creates the Management Reserve.

**Back:**
**False**. The Sponsor determines it, as it is outside the project baseline.

### Card 52
**Front:**
**True or False**: If CPI is 1.0, you are exactly on budget.

**Back:**
**True**. You are getting exactly $1 of value for every $1 spent.

### Card 53
**Front:**
**True or False**: "Price" and "Cost" are the same thing.

**Back:**
**False**. Cost is what you spend to create it. Price is what you charge the customer. (Generally, AC refers to Cost).

### Card 54
**Front:**
**Calculate**: BAC = 100, EV = 40, AC = 50. Find CPI.

**Back:**
CPI = 40 / 50 = 0.8.

### Card 55
**Front:**
**Calculate**: BAC = 100, EV = 40, AC = 50. Find CV.

**Back:**
CV = 40 - 50 = -10.

### Card 56
**Front:**
**Calculate**: EV = 40, PV = 50. Find SPI.

**Back:**
SPI = 40 / 50 = 0.8.

### Card 57
**Front:**
**Calculate**: CPI = 0.8, BAC = 100. Find EAC (Typical).

**Back:**
EAC = 100 / 0.8 = 125.

### Card 58
**Front:**
What does a **negative VAC** mean?

**Back:**
You are forecasted to be **Over Budget** at the end of the project.

### Card 59
**Front:**
What is the **50/50 Rule** in EVM?

**Back:**
A heuristic where an activity is considered 50% complete when it starts, and gets the remaining 50% only when it finishes. (Used to simplify reporting).

### Card 60
**Front:**
Does **Resource Leveling** typically increase cost?

**Back:**
It can. While it stabilizes resource usage, sticking to a specific resource limit might extend the schedule, increasing "Cost of Money" or overhead.

## 🚦 Closing & Auditing Finance

### Card 61
**Front:**
What happens to unused **Contingency Reserve** at project close?

**Back:**
It is returned to the organization (profit/savings). It implies the risks did not happen.

### Card 62
**Front:**
What is a **Financial Audit**?

**Back:**
A review to ensure that project funds were spent in accordance with the contract and organizational policies.

### Card 63
**Front:**
What is **ROI**?

**Back:**
Return on Investment. (Net Benefit / Cost) * 100.

### Card 64
**Front:**
What is **NPV**?

**Back:**
Net Present Value. The sum of the present values of incoming and outgoing cash flows. NPV > 0 is good.

### Card 65
**Front:**
What is **IRR**?

**Back:**
Internal Rate of Return. The discount rate that makes NPV zero. Higher is better.

### Card 66
**Front:**
What is **Payback Period**?

**Back:**
The time it takes to recover the initial investment. Shorter is better.

### Card 67
**Front:**
What is **Benefit-Cost Ratio (BCR)**?

**Back:**
Benefit / Cost. >1 is good.

### Card 68
**Front:**
Do you calculate EVM on **Management Reserves**?

**Back:**
**No**. EVM tracks performance against the Baseline. Management Reserve is not in the Baseline.

### Card 69
**Front:**
What is **Variable Cost**?

**Back:**
Cost that changes with the amount of production or work (e.g., material costs, hourly labor).

### Card 70
**Front:**
What is **Fixed Cost**?

**Back:**
Cost that remains constant regardless of production volume (e.g., rent, setup fee).

## 🔢 Calculation Practice (EAC)

### Card 71
**Front:**
**Problem**: BAC = $200k. AC = $100k. EV = $80k. CPI = 0.8. Performance is expected to continue at this rate. Calculate **EAC**.

**Back:**
EAC = BAC / CPI = 200,000 / 0.8 = **$250,000**.

### Card 72
**Front:**
**Problem**: BAC = $200k. AC = $100k. EV = $80k. The variance was due to a one-time storm. Future work will be at budgeted rate. Calculate **EAC**.

**Back:**
EAC = AC + (BAC - EV) = 100,000 + (200,000 - 80,000) = 100,000 + 120,000 = **$220,000**.

### Card 73
**Front:**
**Problem**: BAC = $100k. EAC = $120k. Calculate **VAC**.

**Back:**
VAC = BAC - EAC = 100,000 - 120,000 = **-$20,000**. (Over budget).

### Card 74
**Front:**
**Problem**: BAC = $500k. EV = $200k. AC = $250k. Calculate **TCPI** (to BAC).

**Back:**
TCPI = (500k - 200k) / (500k - 250k) = 300k / 250k = **1.2**.
(Must be 20% more efficient to hit original budget).

### Card 75
**Front:**
**Problem**: BAC = $500k. EV = $200k. AC = $250k. Management approves a new budget (EAC) of $600k. Calculate **TCPI** (to EAC).

**Back:**
TCPI = (500k - 200k) / (600k - 250k) = 300k / 350k = **0.86**.
(Can be less efficient and still hit the new budget).

### Card 76
**Front:**
**Problem**: Why is Cost Variance (CV) expressed as a standard formula?

**Back:**
CV = EV - AC. It's standardized so that a negative number always means "bad" (cost exceeded value).

### Card 77
**Front:**
**Problem**: If SPI is 1.0 and CPI is 0.5, what does this tell you about the schedule?

**Back:**
The project is on schedule, but at a huge cost (we are spending double to stay on time). This is likely unsustainable ("Crashing").

### Card 78
**Front:**
**Problem**: Is "Rent" a direct or indirect cost?

**Back:**
Usually **Indirect**, unless the office was rented specifically and exclusively for this project.

### Card 79
**Front:**
**Problem**: What is the most precise estimating technique?

**Back:**
**Bottom-Up**.

### Card 80
**Front:**
**Problem**: What is the PMP term for "Profit"?

**Back:**
**Fee** (in procurement contexts) or **Margin**.
