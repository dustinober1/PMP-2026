# 7.2 Quality Management

In the 2026 PMP exam, **Quality** is defined as the *degree to which a set of inherent characteristics fulfills requirements*. Put simply: Quality is about **delivering exactly what was promised**.

## 💎 Quality vs. Grade
A common PMP trap is confusing these two concepts.
- **Grade**: A category assigned to deliverables having the same functional use but different technical characteristics (e.g., a "budget" phone vs. a "flagship" phone).
- **Quality**: How well the deliverable works and follows the specs.

::: warning 🚦 The Golden Rule
Low **Grade** is okay (if the customer asked for it). Low **Quality** is *never* okay.

## 🛠️ The Quality Lifecycle
### 1. Quality Assurance (QA) - *The Process*
Focuses on the processes used to create the deliverables. It is **proactive** and aimed at preventing defects.
- **Key Tool**: Quality Audits and Process Analysis.

### 2. Quality Control (QC) - *The Product*
Focuses on the deliverables themselves. It is **reactive** and aimed at identifying defects.
- **Key Tool**: Testing, Inspections, and the 7 Basic Quality Tools.

## 📊 The 7 Basic Quality Tools
You must know when to use each for the exam:
1. **Fishbone (Ishikawa)**: Used for **Root Cause Analysis**.
2. **Histograms**: Showing the distribution of data (e.g., number of defects per month).
3. **Pareto Charts**: The 80/20 rule. Focus on the **few** causes that create the **most** problems.
4. **Control Charts**: Determining if a process is "In Control" using Upper/Lower Control Limits.
5. **Scatter Diagrams**: Identifying relationships between two variables.
6. **Flowcharts**: Mapping out a process to find bottlenecks.
7. **Checksheets**: Simple tools for data collection.

## 🔄 Quality in Agile
In Agile, quality is built into every step through:
- **Definition of Done (DoD)**: A shared checklist of quality criteria that must be met before a story is considered finished.
- **Pair Programming**: Real-time code review.
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Writing the test *before* the code is written.
- **Retrospectives**: The primary engine for **Continuous Improvement**.

  <strong>📝 Exam Insight:</strong> If an exam scenario says a process is producing inconsistent results, the Project Manager should use a <strong>Control Chart</strong> to see if the process is <strong>In Control</strong> or if "Special Cause" variation is occurring.
