# Chapter 7: Risk, Quality & Complexity

Modern projects live in a world of **V.U.C.A.** (Volatility, Uncertainty, Complexity, and Ambiguity). On the PMP exam, your value is measured by how you navigate the unknown while maintaining consistent quality.

::: tip  PMP Exam Weight
Risk and Quality topics comprise **approximately 15-20%** of the PMP exam. Combined with project planning and execution questions, your ability to identify risks early, choose the best response, apply the right quality tool, and recognize complex environments is critical to passing.

##  The Domain of Uncertainty
Risk, Quality, and Complexity are interwoven. A failure in quality is a realized risk, and complexity is often the root cause of both.

### The Integration Triangle
Think of these three domains as interconnected:
- **Risk** increases when **complexity** rises and **quality** processes are weak
- **Quality** defects become **risks** (if not caught) and **issues** (when they escape)
- **Complexity** drives both **risk** (unknown-unknowns) and **quality** challenges (more failure points)

**Exam Insight**: The best answers often combine risk mitigation + quality built-in + adaptive delivery (iteration/feedback).

### What this chapter makes you exam-ready for
- Choosing the *best* risk response (not just naming a register)
- Knowing when the situation calls for **QA vs QC** (process vs product)
- Recognizing when an environment is **complex** (and shifting to iterative/adaptive approaches)
- Spotting classic traps like confusing **control limits vs specification limits** or **risk vs issue**

### High-yield artifacts and “first moves”
| If you see this in a question… | Think… |
|---|---|
| “A risk has occurred” | Execute the planned response → log as **issue** |
| “Audit / ensure process compliance” | **Manage Quality (QA)** |
| “Test/inspect deliverable” | **Control Quality (QC)** |
| “High uncertainty / unclear solution” | **Iterate + experiment** (complex domain) |
