# 7.1 Risk Management

Risk is simply "uncertainty that matters." In the 2026 PMP exam, the goal isn't just to fill out a Risk Register; it's to build a project that is **resilient** to shock and **agile** enough to seize opportunities.

## 🏗️ The Risk Equation
A risk is an uncertain event. If it happens, it has an impact.
- **Threats**: Negative risks (Events we want to avoid or minimize).
- **Opportunities**: Positive risks (Events we want to trigger or maximize).
- **Formula**: $Risk = Probability \times Impact$

::: tip 💡 2026 Focus: Issues vs. Risks
A **Risk** is in the future (Uncertain). An **Issue** is in the present (Certain/Happening). You manage Risks in the **Risk Register** and Issues in the **Issue Log**.

## 📊 Risk Analysis
You must prioritize where to spend your time.

### 1. Qualitative Analysis (The Matrix)
Ranking risks as "High, Medium, or Low" based on their position on the **Probability and Impact Matrix**. This is subjective and fast.

### 2. Quantitative Analysis (The Math)
Calculating the numeric impact on project objectives.
| Technique                | Description                                                                                         |
| :----------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Monte Carlo**          | A computer simulation that runs the project 1,000+ times to predict the likely finish date or cost. |
| **Sensitivity Analysis** | Using a "Tornado Diagram" to see which single risk has the most power to derail the project.        |
| **Decision Tree (EMV)**  | $Expected Monetary Value = Probability \times \$ Impact$.                                           |

## 🛡️ Response Strategies
The exam will give you a scenario and ask for the BEST strategy. You must know these for both threats and opportunities:

| For Threats (Negative) | Description                                                                   |
| :--------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Avoid**              | Eliminate the threat (e.g., change the scope to remove a dangerous activity). |
| **Mitigate**           | Reduce probability or impact (e.g., more testing).                            |
| **Transfer**           | Shift the risk to someone else (e.g., insurance or a fixed-price contract).   |
| **Accept**             | Do nothing until it happens (use contingency).                                |

| For Opportunities (Positive) | Description                                                     |
| :--------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Exploit**                  | Ensure the opportunity happens (e.g., assign your best expert). |
| **Enhance**                  | Increase probability or impact.                                 |
| **Share**                    | Give some of the upside to a partner who can help trigger it.   |
| **Accept**                   | Take it if it comes, but don't work for it.                     |

## 🔄 Risk in 2026: The "Pre-Mortem"
Modern teams use the **Pre-Mortem** technique: Imagine it's one year from now and the project has failed miserably. Now, work backward to identify the "ghosts" (risks) that killed it. This surfaces blind spots that traditional brainstorming misses.

  <strong>📝 Exam Insight:</strong> If an exam scenario says a risk has occurred, your first action is NOT to update the Risk Register; it is to **Implement the planned Response** and update the **Issue Log**.
