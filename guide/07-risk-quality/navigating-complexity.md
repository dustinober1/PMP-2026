# 7.3 Navigating Complexity

Complexity is not just about a project being "hard." A nuclear power plant is *complicated*, but a project to change a corporate culture is *complex*. In the 2026 PMP exam, you must show you can tell the difference.

## 🧭 The Cynefin Framework
The Cynefin (pronounced *kun-ev-in*) framework helps you choose the right management style based on the environment.

| Domain          | Relationship                                | PM Approach                                            |
| :-------------- | :------------------------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Clear**       | Cause and effect are obvious.               | **Sense - Categorize - Respond**. Use Best Practices.  |
| **Complicated** | Cause and effect require analysis.          | **Sense - Analyze - Respond**. Bring in Experts.       |
| **Complex**     | Cause and effect only visible in hindsight. | **Probe - Sense - Respond**. Safe-to-Fail Experiments. |
| **Chaotic**     | No relationship between cause and effect.   | **Act - Sense - Respond**. Stabilize immediately.      |

## 🏗️ Sources of Complexity
Complexity in 2026 projects usually stems from three areas:
1. **Human Behavior**: Conflicting agendas, politics, and shifting stakeholder emotions.
2. **System Behavior**: Interdependencies between hardware, software, and external APIs.
3. **Ambiguity**: Not knowing what you don't know (e.g., building a product for a market that doesn't exist yet).

## 🔬 Systems Thinking
A Project Manager must be a **Systems Thinker**. This means looking at the project as a collection of interacting parts rather than a list of tasks.
- **Feedback Loops**: Understanding how a delay in Step A might create a "vicious cycle" that speeds up failures in Step D.
- **Emergent Outcomes**: Accepting that the "whole" project might behave in ways you didn't plan for once all the parts come together.

## 🛠️ Strategies for Complexity
When a project gets "messy," use these tactics:
- **Iterative Delivery**: Don't plan the whole thing. Plan the next two weeks, build, and learn.
- **Diversity of Thought**: Bring in people from different departments to look at the same problem.
- **Safe-to-Fail Experiments**: Instead of a "Big Bang" release, release a tiny feature to a tiny group of users to see what happens.

  <strong>📝 Exam Insight:</strong> If a question describes a project where "experts agree on the goal but disagree on how to get there," you are in a **Complex** environment. The correct answer will involve <strong>Adaptive</strong> or <strong>Agile</strong> techniques, not more detailed planning.
