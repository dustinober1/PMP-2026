# Knowledge Check: Risk, Quality, and Complexity

Test your understanding of risk management, quality management, and navigating complexity.

## Practice Questions

### Question 1: Risk Response Strategy

A project team identifies a risk that a key vendor may go bankrupt. They decide to use a different vendor to eliminate this risk entirely. Which risk response strategy is this?

- A) Mitigate
- B) Transfer
- C) Avoid ✓
- D) Accept

**Explanation**: Avoid eliminates the risk by changing the project plan. By using a different vendor, the bankruptcy risk is eliminated.

### Question 2: EMV Calculation

A risk has a 30% probability of occurring and would cost $50,000 if it happens. What is the Expected Monetary Value (EMV)?

- A) $15,000 ✓
- B) $50,000
- C) $30,000
- D) $35,000

**Explanation**: EMV = Probability × Impact = 0.30 × $50,000 = $15,000

### Question 3: Quality vs. Grade

A software product has all required features working correctly, but it only supports 100 concurrent users (not enterprise-scale). This describes:

- A) Low quality
- B) Low grade ✓
- C) Poor quality assurance
- D) Defective product

**Explanation**: The product meets its requirements (quality), but is lower grade (simpler category). Low grade can be acceptable; low quality is not.

---

### Question 4: QA vs. QC

A project manager conducts a process audit to ensure the team is following established procedures. This is an example of:

- A) Quality Control
- B) Quality Assurance ✓
- C) Quality Planning
- D) Continuous Improvement

**Explanation**: QA focuses on processes (doing things right). Auditing procedures is QA. Testing deliverables would be QC.

---

### Question 5: Seven Quality Tools

Which quality tool would be MOST useful to identify the causes that contribute most to a problem?

- A) Control Chart
- B) Pareto Chart ✓
- C) Histogram
- D) Scatter Diagram

**Explanation**: Pareto charts identify the "vital few" causes (80/20 rule). They help prioritize which causes to address first.

---

### Question 6: Risk Transfer

A company purchases insurance to cover potential project losses. This is an example of:

- A) Risk avoidance
- B) Risk mitigation
- C) Risk transfer ✓
- D) Risk acceptance

**Explanation**: Insurance transfers the financial impact of a risk to the insurance company. You still pay for transfers (premiums).

---

### Question 7: Control Chart

On a control chart, data points fall within the control limits but show seven consecutive points above the mean. This indicates:

- A) Process is in control
- B) Normal variation
- C) Process is out of control ✓
- D) Random fluctuation

**Explanation**: The "Rule of Seven" - seven consecutive points on one side of the mean indicates a non-random pattern, signaling the process may be out of control.

---

### Question 8: Complexity vs. Complicated

The difference between a complicated and complex project is:

- A) Complex projects have more tasks
- B) Complicated projects are harder
- C) Complex projects have unpredictable emergent behavior ✓
- D) Complicated projects cost more

**Explanation**: Complicated projects can be analyzed and planned with expertise. Complex projects have emergent, unpredictable behavior requiring adaptive approaches.

---

### Question 9: Residual Risk

After implementing a risk response, the remaining risk is called:

- A) Secondary risk
- B) Residual risk ✓
- C) Transferred risk
- D) Accepted risk

**Explanation**: Residual risk is what remains after the response. Secondary risk is NEW risk created by the response.

---

### Question 10: Opportunity Response

A project team identifies an opportunity to complete early if they add a skilled resource. They decide to assign their best developer to maximize this chance. This strategy is:

- A) Accept
- B) Enhance
- C) Exploit ✓
- D) Share

**Explanation**: Exploit ensures the opportunity happens by taking definite action (assigning best resource).

## Exam Tips for Risk and Quality Questions

::: tip Key Strategies
For risk questions:
1. Identify if it's a threat or opportunity
2. Match the response strategy to the action described
3. Know EMV = P × I

For quality questions:
1. Distinguish QA (process) from QC (product)
2. Know what each of the 7 tools is used for
3. Remember: prevention < failure cost
:::

### Common Wrong Answer Patterns

- ❌ Confusing avoid with mitigate
- ❌ Confusing transfer with acceptance
- ❌ Confusing QA with QC
- ❌ Thinking low grade = low quality
- ❌ Treating complexity like just "harder"

### Right Answer Patterns

- ✅ Avoid = eliminate the risk entirely
- ✅ Transfer = shift to third party (insurance, contracts)
- ✅ QA = process focused, preventive
- ✅ QC = product focused, detective
- ✅ Complex = adaptive approach needed

Risk and quality are heavily tested. Know the response strategies by heart, and be able to identify which quality tool fits each scenario.
