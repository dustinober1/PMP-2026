    {
      text: 'A high-impact risk has just occurred. The project manager identifies it as a risk that was already in the Risk Register with a pre-planned response. What is the PM’s FIRST action?',
      options: [
        'Update the Risk Register status to: Occurred',
        'Inform the Sponsor and wait for approval to spend the contingency',
        'Implement the planned Risk Response and update the Issue Log',
        'Pause the project to update the risk probability of other items'
      ],
      correct: 2,
      explanation: 'Once a risk occurs, it is an issue. The PM should immediately execute the response they planned during the risk planning phase and document the event in the Issue Log.',
      reference: 'Section 7.1'
    },
    {
      text: 'A team member is auditing the software development workflow to ensure the team is following the mandated security protocols. What is this activity considered?',
      options: [
        'Quality Control',
        'Quality Assurance',
        'Risk Mitigation',
        'Stakeholder Engagement'
      ],
      correct: 1,
      explanation: 'Auditing processes to ensure they are being followed correctly is a proactive Quality Assurance (QA) activity. Quality Control (QC) would be testing the software itself.',
      reference: 'Section 7.2'
    },
    {
      text: 'Your project is seeing a high number of defects. You want to identify which specific 20% of causes are creating 80% of the defects so you can prioritize fixes. Which tool should you use?',
      options: [
        'Fishbone Diagram',
        'Pareto Chart',
        'Control Chart',
        'Scatter Diagram'
      ],
      correct: 1,
      explanation: 'A Pareto Chart ranks causes by frequency. It is based on the Pareto Principle (80/20 rule) to help PMs focus on the "vital few" problems.',
      reference: 'Section 7.2'
    },
    {
      text: 'You are working on a high-tech R&D project. Stakeholders agree on the goal, but the technical path is unpredictable and expertos disagree on the method. According to Cynefin, how should you manage this?',
      options: [
        'Use Best Practices (Sense-Categorize-Respond)',
        'Hire more experts (Sense-Analyze-Respond)',
        'Run Safe-to-Fail Experiments (Probe-Sense-Respond)',
        'Take immediate action to stabilize (Act-Sense-Respond)'
      ],
      correct: 2,
      explanation: 'In a Complex environment (unclear cause and effect), the best approach is to "Probe" (experiment), "Sense" the result, and "Respond" (adapt).',
      reference: 'Section 7.3'
    },
    {
      text: 'What is the most expensive category of the Cost of Quality (COQ)?',

        'Prevention (Training/Planning)',
        'Appraisal (Testing/Inspections)',
        'Internal Failure (Rework/Scrap)',
        'External Failure (Lawsuits/Loss of Reputation)'
      ],
      correct: 3,
      explanation: 'External Failure costs are the highest because they occur after the customer receives the product, leading to loss of brand equity, lawsuits, and warranty claims.',

## Additional Study Topics

For full Chapter 7 proficiency, ensure you can:

1.  **Select the Response**: When to *Transfer* (Insurance) vs. *Mitigate* (Testing).
2.  **Read the Chart**: Knowing the "Rule of 7" on a Control Chart.
3.  **Root Cause**: Using the "5 Whys" in combination with a Fishbone diagram.
4.  **Systems Thinking**: Identifying how a schedule delay in one department creates a "Feedback Loop" of stress in another.
