Lets go through all the section in @guide/09-monitoring folder and see if there are opportunity to explain and explain in more detail and if we can make about 25 questions covering this material for the final knowledge check. I wan't this to be a one stop shop for all PMP students, I don't want them to have to go anywhere else. Do this by going file by file and also evaluating if we need to add more files. When you are done, commit and push to the repository.
