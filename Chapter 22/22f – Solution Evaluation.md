## Introduction: Ensuring Solution Value

Solution Evaluation assesses whether implemented solutions are delivering intended value and identifies opportunities for improvement. It's the critical link between project delivery and business value realization.

**Sarah's Evaluation Experience:**
Three months after implementing the new expense reporting system, Sarah conducted a solution evaluation. She discovered:
- System performance exceeded expectations (85% reduction in processing time)
- User adoption was lower than anticipated (60% vs. 90% target)
- Some features were rarely used
- Additional needs had emerged

This evaluation led to targeted improvements and enhanced value delivery.
