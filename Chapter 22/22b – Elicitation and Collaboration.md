## Introduction: Getting Requirements Right

Elicitation and collaboration is where business analysis meets real people. It's the art and science of drawing out, understanding, and documenting stakeholder needs. Poor elicitation leads to missed requirements, rework, and project failure. Effective elicition ensures you're building the right thing.

**Sarah's Experience:**
In her first major project, Sarah relied on email exchanges to gather requirements. The result? Misunderstandings, missing requirements, and an unhappy sponsor. She learned that effective elicitation requires:
- Proper preparation
- Multiple techniques
- Active collaboration
- Continuous validation

- **Support Staff**: Post-implementation considerations

### 3. Select Appropriate Techniques

**Technique Selection Factors:**
- **Requirement Type**: Functional vs. non-functional, business vs. technical
- **Stakeholder Availability**: Co-located vs. distributed
- **Complexity**: Simple vs. complex requirements
- **Time Constraints**: Timeline for elicitation
- **Organizational Culture**: Collaborative vs. hierarchical
- **Risk Level**: High-impact vs. low-impact requirements

### 4. Prepare Elicitation Materials

2. **Generation**: Quantity over quality initially
3. **Clarification**: Ensure understanding of ideas
4. **Grouping**: Cluster related ideas
5. **Prioritization**: Rank or vote on importance

**Guidelines:**
- No criticism during idea generation
- Encourage wild ideas
- Build on others' ideas
- Stay focused on topic
- One conversation at a time

**Sarah's Example:**
During office renovation planning, Sarah used brainstorming to generate ideas for collaboration spaces. The result: 47 ideas grouped into 6 categories with clear priorities.
