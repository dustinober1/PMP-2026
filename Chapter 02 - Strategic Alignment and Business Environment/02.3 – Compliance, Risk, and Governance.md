# 2.3 – Compliance, Risk, and Governance

## Overview

Projects must operate within legal, regulatory, and organizational boundaries. This section covers how to manage compliance requirements, data privacy, and governance frameworks effectively.

### Key Concepts

1.  **Regulatory Compliance:** Adhering to external laws (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, building codes) and internal policies.
2.  **Data Privacy:** Protecting sensitive information and ensuring data security throughout the project lifecycle.
3.  **Governance:** The framework of authority and accountability that defines and controls the outputs, outcomes, and benefits of projects.

### Structure

*   **2.3a – Regulatory Compliance:** Identifying and managing legal constraints.
*   **2.3b – Data Privacy:** Managing security and privacy risks.
*   **2.3c – Organizational Policies:** Aligning with internal standards.
*   **2.3d – Governance Frameworks:** Understanding decision-making structures.

*(Note: These topics are integrated into the broader risk and governance discussions in Chapters 1 and 7, but are highlighted here as specific business environment constraints.)*
