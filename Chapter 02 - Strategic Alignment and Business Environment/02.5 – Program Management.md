# 2.5 – Program Management

## Overview

While the PMP exam focuses on *Project* Management, many project managers work within or lead *Programs*. This section provides a foundational understanding of Program Management concepts, particularly how they relate to coordinating multiple projects to achieve strategic benefits.

### Key Concepts

1.  **Program:** A group of related projects, subsidiary programs, and program activities managed in a coordinated manner to obtain benefits not available from managing them individually.
2.  **Program vs. Project:** Projects deliver outputs; Programs deliver outcomes and benefits.
3.  **The Five Program Management Performance Domains:**
    *   Strategy Alignment
    *   Benefits Management
    *   Stakeholder Engagement
    *   Governance
    *   Life Cycle Management
