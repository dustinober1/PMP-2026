# 2.4 – Organizational Change and Readiness

## Overview

Projects introduce change. Whether it's a new system, a new process, or a new organizational structure, success depends on people adopting that change. This section covers Organizational Change Management (OCM).

### Key Concepts

1.  **Change Management:** The structured approach to transitioning individuals, teams, and organizations from a current state to a desired future state.
2.  **Change Readiness:** Assessing the organization's ability to absorb change.
3.  **Adoption:** Ensuring stakeholders actually use the new capabilities delivered by the project.

### Structure

*   **2.4a – Impact Analysis:** Understanding who is affected and how.
*   **2.4b – Change Frameworks:** Using models like ADKAR and Kotter's 8 Steps.
*   **2.4c – Communication & Training:** Enabling people to change.
*   **2.4d – Managing Resistance:** Addressing the human side of change.
*   **2.4e – Sustainment:** Ensuring change sticks after the project closes.

*(Note: Detailed change management strategies are integrated into the People domain discussions in Chapter 3 and Stakeholder Engagement in Chapter 4.)*
