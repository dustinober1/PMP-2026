## Introduction

"Why are we doing this project?" It's a simple question that every project manager should be able to answer clearly. Yet Sarah had seen too many projects launched without a compelling answer—initiatives that seemed like good ideas but lacked clear connection to organizational goals.

When the expense system project was first proposed, Sarah asked this question during the kickoff meeting. The sponsor's response was illuminating: "Our strategic plan calls for digital transformation and improved customer experience. Manual expense processes frustrate employees, slow reimbursements, and create administrative overhead. This system addresses operational efficiency *and* supports our digital transformation goals."

That clarity made everything easier. When scope questions arose, the team could ask: "Does this feature support digital transformation or operational efficiency?" When budget pressures emerged, executives understood the strategic rationale for continued investment.

Not every project had such clear strategic alignment. The office renovation, while valuable for employee satisfaction, was harder to connect to formal strategic objectives. It was primarily an operational necessity—the current space was outdated and creating productivity challenges. Understanding this distinction helped Sarah set appropriate expectations and governance structures.

## Understanding Organizational Strategy

### What Is Organizational Strategy?

**Organizational strategy** is the high-level plan that defines how an organization will achieve its mission and vision. It answers fundamental questions:

- **Where are we going?** (Vision and strategic goals)
- **How will we get there?** (Strategic initiatives and priorities)
- **What must we do differently?** (Change imperatives and transformation)
- **How will we measure success?** (Strategic metrics and outcomes)

Strategy operates at multiple levels:

1. **Corporate strategy**: Overall direction for the entire organization (e.g., market expansion, mergers and acquisitions, diversification)
2. **Business unit strategy**: How individual business units compete and deliver value in their markets
3. **Functional strategy**: How departments (IT, HR, operations) support business objectives
4. **Operational strategy**: Day-to-day execution and continuous improvement

**Projects and programs** are the mechanisms through which strategy is executed. They translate strategic intent into tangible outcomes.

### Strategic Planning Frameworks

Organizations use various frameworks to develop and communicate strategy. Understanding these frameworks helps project managers see how their work fits into the bigger picture.

#### 1. SWOT Analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats)

A classic framework for assessing strategic position:

- **Strengths/Weaknesses**: Internal factors (capabilities, resources, culture)
- **Opportunities/Threats**: External factors (market trends, competition, regulations)

Projects often emerge from SWOT analysis:
- Leveraging strengths (e.g., expanding a successful product line)
- Addressing weaknesses (e.g., modernizing outdated technology)
- Pursuing opportunities (e.g., entering new markets)
- Mitigating threats (e.g., responding to competitive pressure)

#### 2. Balanced Scorecard

Developed by Kaplan and Norton, the Balanced Scorecard measures organizational performance across four perspectives:

- **Financial**: Revenue, profitability, cost management
- **Customer**: Satisfaction, retention, market share
- **Internal Processes**: Efficiency, quality, innovation
- **Learning and Growth**: Employee capabilities, culture, technology

Projects should contribute to one or more perspectives. For example:
- Sarah's expense system improves internal processes (efficiency) and customer experience (employee satisfaction)
- The transformation program addresses all four perspectives

#### 3. Strategic Themes and Objectives

Many organizations organize strategy around **strategic themes**—major focus areas that guide investment and prioritization:

- Digital transformation
- Customer experience excellence
- Operational efficiency
- Sustainability and social responsibility
- Market expansion

Each theme has specific **strategic objectives** that projects support. For example:

**Theme**: Digital Transformation
- **Objective 1**: Automate manual processes
- **Objective 2**: Enable self-service capabilities
- **Objective 3**: Leverage data for decision-making

**Sarah's expense system** directly supports Objectives 1 and 2.

#### 4. OKRs (Objectives and Key Results)

Popular in agile organizations, OKRs define:
- **Objectives**: Qualitative goals (what we want to achieve)
- **Key Results**: Quantitative measures (how we'll know we succeeded)

Example:
- **Objective**: Become the employer of choice in our industry
- **Key Result 1**: Achieve 90% employee satisfaction score
- **Key Result 2**: Reduce voluntary turnover to below 10%
- **Key Result 3**: Fill 80% of leadership positions with internal candidates

Projects supporting this objective might include culture transformation, leadership development programs, or workspace improvements (like Sarah's office renovation).

## Project Selection: From Ideas to Initiatives

Organizations typically have more project ideas than resources to execute them. **Project selection** is the process of evaluating proposals and deciding which deserve investment.

### The Project Selection Pipeline

Most organizations follow a structured selection process:

1. **Ideation**: Stakeholders propose project ideas
2. **Initial screening**: Quick evaluation against basic criteria (feasibility, rough cost estimate, strategic relevance)
3. **Business case development**: Selected ideas receive detailed analysis (see Chapter 5.1)
4. **Evaluation and prioritization**: Formal assessment against strategic criteria
5. **Portfolio inclusion**: Approved projects enter the portfolio and receive resource allocation
6. **Ongoing review**: Projects are periodically reassessed for continued strategic fit

### Strategic Selection Criteria

Different organizations emphasize different criteria, but most consider:

#### 1. Strategic Alignment

**The most critical criterion.** Does this project directly support strategic objectives?

- **High alignment**: The expense system automates processes (strategic theme: digital transformation)
- **Medium alignment**: The office renovation improves employee experience (supports culture objectives indirectly)
- **Low alignment**: A project that addresses a department's preference but lacks strategic connection

#### 2. Financial Return

What's the expected ROI, NPV, or payback period?

- **Predictive projects** often emphasize detailed financial projections
- **Agile projects** may focus on incremental value delivery and option value
- **Compliance projects** may have negative ROI but are strategically necessary

#### 3. Risk and Feasibility

How likely is the project to succeed? What's the risk exposure?

- Technical complexity
- Resource availability
- Dependency on other initiatives
- External factors (regulatory, market)

#### 4. Resource Requirements

What investment is needed?

- Capital costs
- Staffing (especially scarce skills)
- Opportunity cost (what else could we do with these resources?)

#### 5. Strategic Urgency

How time-sensitive is this initiative?

- **Compliance-driven**: Regulatory deadline (high urgency)
- **Market-driven**: Competitive threat or opportunity window (medium-high urgency)
- **Optimization-driven**: Continuous improvement (lower urgency, can be deferred)

#### 6. Organizational Capacity

Can we absorb this change?

- Change saturation (how many other changes are underway?)
- Cultural readiness (see Chapter 2.4)
- Stakeholder availability (are key people already overcommitted?)

### Example: Sarah's Three Projects

Let's see how Sarah's projects scored against these criteria:

| **Criterion** | **Office Renovation** | **Expense System** | **Transformation Program** |
|---------------|----------------------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| **Strategic Alignment** | Medium (employee satisfaction) | High (digital transformation) | Very High (core strategy) |
| **Financial Return** | Low (operational necessity) | High (cost savings + efficiency) | High (long-term value) |
| **Risk** | Low (well-understood work) | Medium (technology implementation) | High (organizational change) |
| **Resource Requirements** | Medium (capital, short duration) | Medium (IT staff, moderate cost) | High (extensive resources, multi-year) |
| **Strategic Urgency** | Medium (facility deteriorating) | High (competitive pressure) | Very High (market demands) |
| **Organizational Capacity** | High (limited disruption) | Medium (affects all employees) | Medium (requires significant change) |

**Selection Decision**:
- **Office Renovation**: Approved (operational necessity, limited disruption)
- **Expense System**: Approved (high strategic value, manageable risk)
- **Transformation Program**: Approved (strategic imperative, despite high complexity)

## Project Categories: Strategic, Operational, and Compliance

Not all projects serve the same purpose. Understanding project categories helps set appropriate expectations and governance.

### Strategic Projects

**Purpose**: Directly advance strategic objectives, transform capabilities, or create new value

**Characteristics**:
- High executive visibility
- Significant investment
- Cross-functional impact
- Benefits realization tracked closely
- Often innovative or first-of-a-kind

**Examples**:
- Sarah's transformation program
- New product launches
- Market expansion initiatives
- Digital transformation programs

**Governance implications**:
- Executive steering committee oversight
- Formal benefits realization management
- Strict alignment monitoring
- High tolerance for innovation and experimentation

### Operational Projects

**Purpose**: Improve efficiency, reduce costs, or maintain existing capabilities

**Characteristics**:
- Well-understood scope and approach
- Clear ROI calculations
- Limited organizational change
- Managed within functional areas

**Examples**:
- Sarah's office renovation
- System upgrades and replacements
- Process improvement initiatives
- Infrastructure maintenance

**Governance implications**:
- Functional leadership oversight
- Focus on cost and schedule performance
- Lower risk tolerance (proven approaches preferred)
- Benefits often assumed rather than tracked

### Compliance Projects

**Purpose**: Meet regulatory, legal, or contractual obligations

**Characteristics**:
- Non-discretionary (must be done)
- Fixed deadlines (regulatory effective dates)
- Defined scope (meeting specific requirements)
- Often negative or neutral ROI

**Examples**:
- Regulatory compliance implementations
- Security or privacy enhancements (GDPR, SOC2)
- Safety or environmental remediation
- Audit remediation

**Governance implications**:
- Legal and compliance oversight
- Zero tolerance for missing deadlines
- Scope strictly bounded to requirements
- Cost justified by risk mitigation

### Hybrid Projects

Many projects span categories. Sarah's expense system, for example:
- **Strategic** (digital transformation)
- **Operational** (efficiency improvement)
- **Compliance** (financial control requirements)

Understanding the primary category helps prioritize competing demands. If strategic value is primary, the team can justify additional investment in innovation. If compliance is primary, scope discipline becomes critical.

## Strategic Alignment Across Delivery Approaches

How projects connect to strategy depends significantly on their delivery approach.

### Predictive Projects and Strategic Alignment

**Characteristics**:
- Strategy translated into detailed requirements upfront
- Business case locks in strategic rationale
- Change control protects strategic scope
- Benefits measured post-implementation

**Sarah's office renovation example**:
- Strategic objective: Improve employee satisfaction and collaboration
- Translated to: Open workspace design, collaboration zones, modern amenities
- Measured by: Post-occupancy surveys, space utilization metrics

**Strengths**:
- Clear line of sight from strategy to execution
- Upfront validation of strategic fit
- Predictable resource commitment

**Challenges**:
- Strategy may evolve during long delivery cycles
- Limited flexibility to adapt if strategic priorities shift
- Sunk cost pressure to complete even if alignment weakens

### Agile Projects and Strategic Alignment

**Characteristics**:
- Strategy guides product vision and roadmap
- Backlog prioritization reflects strategic value
- Frequent releases enable adaptive alignment
- Benefits realized incrementally

**Sarah's expense system example** (agile delivery):
- Strategic theme: Digital transformation
- Product vision: Self-service, mobile-friendly expense management
- Sprint prioritization: Features delivering highest strategic value first
- Early releases: Core workflow automation (immediate benefit)
- Later releases: Advanced analytics and integrations (extended value)

**Strengths**:
- Continuous alignment validation through prioritization
- Ability to pivot if strategy changes
- Early value realization reduces strategic risk

**Challenges**:
- Requires ongoing strategic clarity from stakeholders
- Risk of scope creep if strategic boundaries aren't clear
- Tension between adaptive delivery and upfront resource commitment

### Hybrid Projects and Strategic Alignment

**Characteristics**:
- Program-level strategy with team-level adaptation
- Fixed strategic milestones with flexible paths
- Governance balances control and agility

**Sarah's transformation program example**:
- Strategic milestones: Defined organizational capabilities by year
- Team delivery: Agile teams adapt implementation details
- Portfolio governance: Ensures cross-team alignment to strategy
- Benefits tracking: Measured at program level, informed by team-level metrics

**Strengths**:
- Balances strategic predictability with tactical flexibility
- Scales agile benefits to enterprise contexts
- Enables complex strategic initiatives with adaptive execution

**Challenges**:
- Requires sophisticated governance
- Potential misalignment between program-level strategy and team-level priorities
- Resource allocation complexity

## Maintaining Strategic Alignment Throughout the Project Lifecycle

Strategic alignment isn't a one-time approval decision. It requires ongoing attention.

### At Project Initiation

- **Business case** explicitly connects project to strategic objectives (see Chapter 5.1)
- **Project charter** includes strategic rationale and success criteria
- **Stakeholder analysis** identifies strategic decision-makers and influencers

### During Planning

- **Requirements traceability** links features to strategic objectives
- **Benefits realization plan** defines how strategic value will be measured (see Section 2.1d)
- **Governance structure** includes strategic oversight (steering committee, executive sponsors)

### Throughout Execution

- **Regular strategic reviews** validate continued alignment (quarterly for long projects)
- **Change control** evaluates changes against strategic impact
- **Progress reporting** includes strategic metrics, not just schedule and budget
- **Escalation criteria** include strategic misalignment triggers

### At Project Closure

- **Benefits realization** tracked beyond project completion
- **Lessons learned** capture insights about strategic alignment (or misalignment)
- **Strategic contribution** formally assessed and communicated

### Example: Strategic Shift During Execution

Six months into the expense system project, Sarah's organization acquired a competitor. The acquisition brought a different expense management system with a larger user base.

**Strategic question**: Should Sarah's project continue, or should the organization standardize on the acquired system?

**Evaluation process**:
1. **Steering committee review**: Strategic alignment reassessed
2. **Business case update**: Costs, benefits, and strategic value recalculated
3. **Options analysis**: Continue, cancel, or hybrid approach
4. **Decision**: Continue with modified scope—implement planned system but plan integration with acquired company's processes

**Key lesson**: Strategic alignment is dynamic. Projects must adapt or terminate when strategic context changes.

## Common Pitfalls in Strategic Alignment

### 1. Retrofitting Strategy to Justify Pet Projects

**Problem**: Projects proposed for operational or political reasons get artificially connected to strategic themes.

**Example**: A department wants new office furniture and claims it supports "employee satisfaction" (strategic theme). The connection is weak.

**Solution**: Rigorous evaluation using objective criteria. Challenge vague strategic claims.

### 2. Strategic Alignment as a Checkbox

**Problem**: Strategic rationale documented during initiation but ignored during execution.

**Example**: A project charter lists strategic objectives, but weekly status reports only track schedule and budget.

**Solution**: Include strategic metrics in regular reporting. Conduct periodic alignment reviews.

### 3. Ignoring Strategy Shifts

**Problem**: Projects continue on autopilot even as organizational strategy evolves.

**Example**: A market expansion project continues despite the organization pivoting to defend existing markets.

**Solution**: Formal review triggers when strategy changes. Empowered governance to cancel or redirect projects.

### 4. Confusing Outputs with Strategic Outcomes

**Problem**: Measuring project deliverables instead of strategic value.

**Example**: Expense system project deemed "successful" because the software was delivered, even though adoption was low and strategic benefits weren't realized.

**Solution**: Benefits realization management (see Section 2.1d). Track outcomes, not just outputs.

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Strategy drives selection**: Projects should directly support documented strategic objectives. Weak alignment = weak justification.

2. **Selection is competitive**: Organizations have limited resources. Projects compete for investment based on strategic value, financial return, risk, and organizational capacity.

3. **Categories matter**: Strategic, operational, and compliance projects require different governance, expectations, and tolerance for innovation.

4. **Alignment is ongoing**: Strategic fit validated at initiation must be revalidated throughout execution. Strategy changes; projects must adapt or terminate.

5. **Delivery approach impacts alignment**: Predictive, agile, and hybrid approaches maintain strategic alignment differently. Understand the strengths and challenges of each.

6. **Outputs ≠ Outcomes**: Projects deliver outputs (software, buildings, processes). Strategy cares about outcomes (revenue, efficiency, capability). Track both.

---

## Practical Application: Evaluating a Project Proposal

**Scenario**: You're asked to evaluate a proposal for a customer portal that would allow customers to track orders, submit service requests, and access account information online.

**Questions to assess strategic alignment**:

1. **What strategic objectives does this support?** (e.g., customer experience, digital transformation, operational efficiency)
2. **How is strategic value measured?** (e.g., customer satisfaction scores, cost per service request, digital engagement metrics)
3. **What alternatives exist?** (e.g., enhance existing portal, partner with third-party platform, improve call center instead)
4. **How does this compete with other initiatives?** (e.g., what else could we do with the same resources?)
5. **What's the strategic urgency?** (e.g., competitive pressure, customer complaints, market opportunity)
6. **What's the risk if we don't do this?** (e.g., customer attrition, competitive disadvantage, missed revenue)

By answering these questions, you move from "this seems like a good idea" to "this is strategically justified and prioritized appropriately."

## Reflection Questions

1. How clearly can you articulate the strategic rationale for your current project? Could you explain it to an executive in 30 seconds?

2. When was the last time your project's strategic alignment was formally reviewed? If it's been more than 6 months (or one strategic planning cycle), consider requesting a review.

3. Does your project measure strategic outcomes or just project outputs? If the latter, how might you add strategic metrics to your reporting?

4. If your organization's strategy shifted significantly tomorrow, would your project still be justified? If not, what does that tell you about its current strategic value?
