# 2.1g – Advanced Portfolio Management Domains

This section provides a high-level overview of advanced portfolio management domains that support strategic alignment. These topics are often covered in specialized portfolio management standards but are relevant for PMP candidates understanding the broader context.

## Portfolio Stakeholder Engagement

Portfolio stakeholder engagement differs from project stakeholder engagement (see **Section 1.4a**) in its scope and strategic focus.

*   **Strategic vs. Tactical:** Portfolio stakeholders are typically executives, board members, and investors concerned with long-term value and organizational direction, rather than project deliverables.
*   **Competing Interests:** Portfolio managers must balance conflicting demands for resources across multiple business units and strategic themes.
*   **Communication:** Reporting focuses on aggregate health, strategic alignment, and ROI, rather than schedule variance or task completion.

## Portfolio Risk Management

Portfolio risk management addresses risks that affect the entire collection of investments, distinct from individual project risks (see **Section 1.4d**).

*   **Aggregate Risk:** The total risk exposure of the portfolio. Does the organization have too many high-risk projects?
*   **Interdependency Risk:** Risks arising from connections between projects (e.g., if Project A fails, Projects B and C are also doomed).
*   **Diversification:** Balancing the portfolio to ensure a mix of high-risk/high-reward and low-risk/stable investments, similar to financial portfolio management.

## Portfolio Capacity and Capability Management

Ensuring the organization has the ability to execute the selected work (see **Section 2.1b**).

*   **Capacity Management:** Balancing demand (projects) with supply (resources). Do we have enough people and budget?
*   **Capability Management:** Ensuring the organization has the *right* skills and competencies. Do we have the cloud architects or data scientists needed for our strategic roadmap?
*   **Gap Analysis:** Identifying skill gaps and initiating training or hiring programs to close them.
