## Practice Questions

### Question 1: Earned Value Analysis and Forecasting

You are managing a software development project with a budget at completion (BAC) of $800,000 and a planned duration of 10 months. At the end of month 6:

- Planned Value (PV): $480,000
- Earned Value (EV): $400,000
- Actual Cost (AC): $450,000

Based on this information, you need to present a forecast to the steering committee. The committee wants to know the projected final cost assuming current performance trends continue.

**What is the Estimate at Completion (EAC) if you assume the current Cost Performance Index (CPI) will continue for the remainder of the project?**

A) $800,000 (the project will finish on budget)

B) $850,000 (the project will be $50,000 over budget)

C) $900,000 (the project will be $100,000 over budget)

D) $950,000 (the project will be $150,000 over budget)

---

### Question 2: Change Control Process

You are managing a construction project to build a new warehouse. Three weeks into construction, the building inspector informs you that recent code changes require additional fire suppression equipment not included in the original plans. This will add $25,000 to the budget and one week to the schedule.

The project has a formal change control board (CCB) that meets bi-weekly, with the next meeting scheduled in 10 days. However, the general contractor says that delaying this decision will push the schedule back an additional two weeks due to the lead time for equipment procurement.

**What is the BEST course of action?**

A) Approve the change immediately since it's a regulatory requirement, then inform the CCB at the next meeting

B) Contact CCB members for an emergency meeting or email approval to avoid the additional two-week delay

C) Wait for the next scheduled CCB meeting to maintain proper governance, accepting the additional delay

D) Reject the change and proceed with the original design since the change wasn't identified during planning

---

### Question 3: Stakeholder Engagement During Variance

You are managing an agile project to develop a mobile application. After five sprints, the team's velocity has stabilized at 28 story points per sprint, compared to the initial estimate of 35 points per sprint. At this velocity, the project will not deliver all planned features by the target launch date, which is critical for meeting a market window.

The product owner is frustrated and has been sending critical emails to your sponsor, suggesting the team is underperforming. Your sponsor has asked you to "fix the velocity problem."

**What is the BEST approach to managing this situation?**

A) Add more developers to the team to increase velocity and meet the original commitment

B) Ask the team to work overtime to increase story points completed per sprint

C) Schedule a meeting with the product owner and sponsor to discuss options: extend timeline, reduce scope, or accept reduced features

D) Replace underperforming team members with more experienced developers

---

### Question 4: Leading vs. Lagging Indicators

You are managing a predictive project to implement an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system. The project has been underway for 6 months, and you're preparing your monthly status report. You want to include metrics that will help you predict and prevent problems before they become crises.

**Which of the following metrics is the BEST leading indicator for this project?**

A) Number of requirements completed vs. planned

B) Percentage of budget spent to date

C) Number of critical defects found in user acceptance testing

D) Trend in team morale scores over the past three months

---

### Question 5: Configuration Management

You are managing a software project with multiple releases planned over 18 months. The development team uses Git for version control. During a production deployment, a critical bug is discovered that was not present in the testing environment. The team is unsure which code changes introduced the bug because several developers committed code changes without clear descriptions or version tags.

**What configuration management practice would have BEST prevented this situation?**

A) Conducting more thorough testing before deployment

B) Requiring meaningful commit messages and version tags for all code baselines

C) Having only one developer commit code to reduce conflicts

D) Creating daily backups of the codebase

---

### Question 6: Schedule Compression Trade-offs

You are managing a pharmaceutical research project that is three weeks behind schedule. The delay threatens your ability to submit results to regulatory authorities by a critical deadline. Missing this deadline means waiting another year for the next submission window, which would cost the company an estimated $10 million in lost revenue.

You have analyzed schedule compression options:

- **Option 1 (Crashing)**: Add two additional researchers at a cost of $75,000 to recover three weeks
- **Option 2 (Fast-tracking)**: Overlap laboratory analysis and documentation phases, recovering three weeks at no cost but introducing a 30% risk of having to redo documentation if analysis results differ from preliminary findings (rework cost: $40,000)
- **Option 3**: Accept the delay and wait for next year's submission window

**Which option should you recommend to stakeholders?**

A) Option 1 (Crashing) because it has the highest certainty of recovery with no rework risk

B) Option 2 (Fast-tracking) because it recovers the schedule at the lowest cost

C) Option 3 (Accept delay) because the cost of Options 1 and 2 is too high

D) A combination of Options 1 and 2 to split the risk and cost

---

### Question 7: Project Closure and Lessons Learned

You have just completed a complex organizational transformation program involving seven workstreams and 45 team members. The program met its objectives, and deliverables have been transitioned to operations. Your sponsor is eager for you to start a new high-priority initiative and suggests you can "skip the bureaucracy" of formal closure since the program was successful.

**What is the BEST response to your sponsor?**

A) Agree with the sponsor and move to the new initiative, since the program was successful and formal closure would just be paperwork

B) Explain that closure activities—including lessons learned, benefits measurement planning, and formal documentation—are essential for organizational learning and should be completed before starting the new initiative

C) Delegate closure activities to a junior project manager so you can start the new initiative while closure continues in parallel

D) Complete only the contractual and financial closure activities, but skip the lessons learned session since the program was successful

---

### Question 8: Stakeholder Escalation

You are managing a project to upgrade the company's network infrastructure. The IT Security team has requested a change that would add $50,000 to the budget and two weeks to the schedule for additional penetration testing. You believe this testing is unnecessary because similar testing was already completed during the design phase.

The Security Manager insists the additional testing is critical and has the support of the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO). Your project sponsor (the CIO) has told you to "stay on budget and on schedule" and doesn't want scope changes.

You've attempted to resolve this by proposing alternative approaches (using external testing results, conducting focused testing instead of comprehensive testing), but both the Security Manager and your sponsor have rejected these compromises.

**What should you do NEXT?**

A) Proceed without the additional testing to meet your sponsor's direction, since the sponsor has final authority

B) Escalate the conflict to executive leadership, presenting the competing requirements and requesting a decision

C) Approve the security testing and inform your sponsor after the fact, since security is critical

D) Continue negotiating with the Security Manager to find a compromise, even though previous attempts have failed

## Answer Key and Explanations

### Question 1: Earned Value Analysis and Forecasting

**Correct Answer: C) $900,000 (the project will be $100,000 over budget)**

**Explanation:**

To calculate the Estimate at Completion (EAC) assuming current CPI continues, we use the formula: **EAC = BAC / CPI**

First, calculate the Cost Performance Index (CPI):
- **CPI = EV / AC = $400,000 / $450,000 = 0.889**

This CPI indicates the project is getting $0.889 of value for every dollar spent (cost inefficiency).

Now calculate EAC:
- **EAC = $800,000 / 0.889 = $900,000 (rounded)**

This means if the current cost performance continues, the project will finish $100,000 over the original budget.

**Why other options are incorrect:**

- **A**: This assumes the project will return to planned efficiency, which is unrealistic given persistent poor cost performance
- **B**: This underestimates the overrun; the math doesn't support this conclusion
- **D**: This overestimates the overrun; the actual calculation yields $900,000

**Key Concept:** Earned Value Management (EVM) formulas allow you to forecast project outcomes based on current performance trends. The CPI-based EAC formula assumes current efficiency trends will continue—a reasonable assumption when performance has been consistent.

**PMI Alignment:** This question tests Process Domain competencies related to monitoring project performance and forecasting outcomes using quantitative analysis (ECO: Process Domain - Task 6: Plan and manage budget and resources).

### Question 2: Change Control Process

**Correct Answer: B) Contact CCB members for an emergency meeting or email approval to avoid the additional two-week delay**

**Explanation:**

While change control governance is important, PMI emphasizes balancing process rigor with practical project needs. This scenario presents a regulatory compliance requirement (not optional) with time sensitivity (waiting costs an additional two weeks).

**Best Practice Approach:**
1. **Recognize urgency**: Waiting for the normal CCB meeting adds unnecessary project delay
2. **Maintain governance**: Still get CCB approval, just through expedited process
3. **Document properly**: Email approval with impact analysis maintains audit trail
4. **Communicate**: Ensure all CCB members understand the situation and rationale

This approach balances governance (CCB still approves) with responsiveness (avoiding unnecessary delay).

**Why other options are incorrect:**

- **A**: Approving without CCB authorization violates governance and sets bad precedent, even for regulatory changes. CCB approval can be expedited but shouldn't be bypassed.
- **C**: Waiting 10 days adds two weeks of delay for no benefit. Good governance doesn't require rigid adherence to meeting schedules when flexibility is possible.
- **D**: You cannot reject regulatory requirements. This option would put the project and organization at legal/compliance risk.

**Key Concept:** Effective change control balances governance with flexibility. Expedited approval processes for urgent changes are appropriate when properly documented and communicated.

**PMI Alignment:** This question tests Process Domain competencies related to integrated change control and balancing project constraints (ECO: Process Domain - Task 5: Plan and manage scope).

---

### Question 3: Stakeholder Engagement During Variance

**Correct Answer: C) Schedule a meeting with the product owner and sponsor to discuss options: extend timeline, reduce scope, or accept reduced features**

**Explanation:**

This scenario involves velocity variance (28 vs. 35 points) that impacts scope delivery. The PMI approach emphasizes:
1. **Transparency**: Present the reality (velocity is 28, not 35)
2. **Data-driven decisions**: Base forecasts on demonstrated velocity, not hoped-for velocity
3. **Stakeholder collaboration**: Involve decision-makers in trade-off discussions
4. **Options presentation**: Offer alternatives with pros/cons

**Best Practice Approach:**
- Present actual velocity data and forecast
- Explain that initial estimate (35 points) was projection; actual performance (28 points) is reality
- Offer three options: extend timeline to deliver all features, reduce scope to hit timeline, or accept delivering fewer features
- Let product owner and sponsor decide based on business priorities

This approach manages expectations, maintains trust through transparency, and empowers stakeholders to make informed trade-off decisions.

**Why other options are incorrect:**

- **A**: Adding developers typically decreases short-term velocity due to onboarding and communication overhead (Brooks's Law: "Adding people to a late project makes it later"). This doesn't address root cause.
- **B**: Overtime reduces productivity, increases defects, and damages team morale. Sustainable pace is an agile principle; asking for overtime suggests poor planning or unrealistic commitments.
- **D**: Replacing team members is disruptive, expensive, and assumes the team is underperforming when the more likely issue is that the initial estimate was too optimistic.

**Key Concept:** In agile projects, velocity variance is addressed by adjusting scope or timeline, not by trying to force the team to match unrealistic estimates. Demonstrated velocity is the best predictor of future velocity.

**PMI Alignment:** This question tests People Domain competencies related to stakeholder engagement and expectation management (ECO: People Domain - Task 3: Support team performance).

### Question 4: Leading vs. Lagging Indicators

**Correct Answer: D) Trend in team morale scores over the past three months**

**Explanation:**

**Leading indicators** predict future performance and enable proactive intervention. **Lagging indicators** measure what has already happened.

Let's evaluate each option:

**A) Requirements completed**: Lagging indicator. Tells you what's already done, not what problems are coming.

**B) Budget spent**: Lagging indicator. Tells you what money has been spent, not whether future spending will be problematic. (Earned value metrics like CPI would be better, but still somewhat lagging.)

**C) Defects in testing**: Lagging indicator. Problems have already occurred. While valuable, it's reactive.

**D) Team morale trends**: **Leading indicator**. Declining morale predicts:
- Increased attrition (people leaving the project)
- Decreased productivity
- Higher defect rates
- Collaboration problems
- Resistance to change

By tracking morale trends, you can intervene before these problems materialize—training, process improvements, workload adjustments, conflict resolution, etc.

**Key Concept:** Leading indicators enable prevention; lagging indicators enable assessment. Effective monitoring includes both, but leading indicators provide more value for proactive project management.

**PMI Alignment:** This question tests Process Domain competencies related to monitoring project health using appropriate metrics (ECO: Process Domain - Task 6: Plan and manage budget and resources).

### Question 5: Configuration Management

**Correct Answer: B) Requiring meaningful commit messages and version tags for all code baselines**

**Explanation:**

The problem described is a **configuration management and traceability** issue. The team cannot identify which code change introduced the bug because:
- Commit messages don't describe changes clearly
- No version tags mark baselines (versions deployed to testing vs. production)
- No clear audit trail of what changed between environments

**Best Practice:**
- **Meaningful commit messages**: Describe what changed and why (e.g., "Fix null pointer exception in invoice processing" rather than "bug fix")
- **Version tags**: Mark baselines for releases and deployments (e.g., v1.2.3 for production release)
- **Branching strategy**: Use branches for features, releases, and hotfixes
- **Code review**: Require pull request approval before merging

These practices create an audit trail enabling teams to:
- Identify when bugs were introduced
- Roll back to known-good versions
- Understand change history
- Correlate defects with code changes

**Why other options are incorrect:**

- **A**: More testing helps find bugs earlier but doesn't solve the traceability problem. Even with thorough testing, production bugs sometimes occur; you need to be able to identify their source.
- **C**: Single-developer commits reduce conflicts but create bottlenecks, slow development, and don't improve traceability. Multiple developers can commit safely with good configuration management.
- **D**: Backups enable recovery from catastrophic failures but don't provide traceability or help identify which change caused a bug.

**Key Concept:** Configuration management provides traceability, version control, and audit trails. This enables teams to understand what changed, when it changed, and why—critical for troubleshooting and root cause analysis.

**PMI Alignment:** This question tests Process Domain competencies related to configuration management and controlling project artifacts (ECO: Process Domain - Task 5: Plan and manage scope).

### Question 6: Schedule Compression Trade-offs

**Correct Answer: A) Option 1 (Crashing) because it has the highest certainty of recovery with no rework risk**

**Explanation:**

This question requires analyzing trade-offs across cost, schedule, risk, and business value.

**Analysis:**

**Option 1 (Crashing)**:
- Cost: $75,000
- Schedule recovery: 3 weeks (certain)
- Risk: Low (no rework risk)
- Business value: Enables $10M revenue opportunity

**Option 2 (Fast-tracking)**:
- Cost: $0 upfront, but 30% chance of $40,000 rework = $12,000 expected cost
- Schedule recovery: 3 weeks (if no rework needed)
- Risk: Medium-High (30% rework probability; might not actually recover schedule if rework occurs)
- Business value: Enables $10M revenue opportunity IF no rework needed

**Option 3 (Accept delay)**:
- Cost: $0 to project
- Schedule recovery: None
- Risk: None to project; business loses $10M revenue opportunity
- Business value: Loses $10M

**Decision:**
$75,000 to secure a $10M revenue opportunity is an excellent investment (ROI = 13,233%). The certainty of schedule recovery and absence of rework risk make Option 1 the best choice.

Option 2's expected cost ($12,000) is lower, but the 30% rework risk means there's a significant chance it won't actually recover the schedule—and missing the deadline costs $10M. The certainty of Option 1 justifies the higher cost given the enormous business value at stake.

**Why other options are incorrect:**

- **B**: While Option 2 has lower expected cost, the uncertainty and rework risk make it unsuitable given the $10M consequence of missing the deadline. When stakes are high, certainty matters more than cost savings.
- **C**: Accepting a $10M revenue loss to avoid spending $75,000 is poor business judgment.
- **D**: Combining options adds cost without providing additional benefit, since either option alone recovers the three weeks needed.

**Key Concept:** Schedule compression decisions should consider not just cost, but also certainty, risk, and business value. When the cost of delay is high, investing in certain schedule recovery is often justified.

**PMI Alignment:** This question tests Process Domain competencies related to schedule management and trade-off decision-making (ECO: Process Domain - Task 4: Plan and manage schedule).

### Question 7: Project Closure and Lessons Learned

**Correct Answer: B) Explain that closure activities—including lessons learned, benefits measurement planning, and formal documentation—are essential for organizational learning and should be completed before starting the new initiative**

**Explanation:**

PMI emphasizes that project closure is not optional "bureaucracy"—it's essential for:
1. **Organizational learning**: Lessons learned prevent repeating mistakes and propagate best practices
2. **Benefits realization**: Measuring actual benefits validates project value and informs future investment decisions
3. **Knowledge retention**: Documentation preserves knowledge as team members move to new assignments
4. **Accountability**: Formal closure provides transparency about project performance
5. **Continuous improvement**: Closure insights improve future project success rates

**Best Practice:**
- Educate the sponsor about the value of closure activities
- Emphasize that skipping closure wastes the learning opportunity from a complex program
- Note that closure doesn't take long relative to project duration (typically 2-5% of project time)
- Commit to efficient closure (don't make it longer than necessary)

**Why other options are incorrect:**

- **A**: Agreeing to skip closure wastes organizational learning, sets a bad precedent, and violates PMI best practices. Successful projects provide some of the most valuable lessons (what worked well and should be repeated).
- **C**: Delegating closure to someone unfamiliar with the program results in superficial, low-value closure documentation. The project manager who led the program has the context and relationships needed for meaningful closure.
- **D**: Completing only contractual/financial closure while skipping lessons learned misses the most valuable closure activity. Financial closure addresses administrative requirements; lessons learned create organizational capability.

**Key Concept:** Closure is an investment in organizational learning and future project success. It should be proportionate to project size but never skipped entirely.

**PMI Alignment:** This question tests Process Domain competencies related to project closure and knowledge management (ECO: Process Domain - Task 10: Manage project artifacts).

---

### Question 8: Stakeholder Escalation

**Correct Answer: B) Escalate the conflict to executive leadership, presenting the competing requirements and requesting a decision**

**Explanation:**

This scenario presents competing stakeholder requirements that exceed the project manager's authority to resolve:
- **Sponsor (CIO)**: Stay on budget and schedule
- **Security (CISO)**: Add $50K and 2 weeks for testing

**Key indicators that escalation is appropriate:**
1. **Competing executive-level priorities**: CIO vs. CISO
2. **Project manager lacks authority**: Cannot override either executive
3. **Attempts at resolution failed**: Alternatives proposed and rejected
4. **Decision needed**: Project is blocked without resolution
5. **Strategic trade-off**: Security vs. cost/schedule requires executive judgment

**Best Practice Escalation:**
- Present situation objectively to both CIO and CISO (no surprises)
- Frame as strategic trade-off requiring their decision
- Provide options with pros/cons:
  - Option 1: Include additional testing (impact: +$50K, +2 weeks, enhanced security)
  - Option 2: Proceed without additional testing (impact: no cost/schedule change, security risk per CISO)
  - Option 3: Compromise approaches already explored and rejected
- Request joint decision from CIO and CISO
- Implement whatever decision is made

**Why other options are incorrect:**

- **A**: Proceeding without the testing ignores the CISO's security concerns and exposes the organization to risk. If a security breach occurs, the CIO's "stay on budget" directive won't protect you. This also damages relationships with the Security team.
- **C**: Approving the testing without sponsor authorization exceeds your authority and violates the budget constraint. This damages trust with your sponsor and sets a precedent of unauthorized changes.
- **D**: Continuing to negotiate after both parties have rejected compromises is futile and delays the project. Some conflicts require higher-level resolution; recognizing when you've exhausted project-level options is a key PM skill.

**Key Concept:** Escalation isn't failure; it's appropriate when conflicts exceed your authority or when executive-level trade-offs are required. Escalate with professionalism, presenting facts and options without taking sides.

**PMI Alignment:** This question tests People Domain competetencies related to stakeholder engagement and conflict resolution (ECO: People Domain - Task 2: Lead a team and Task 9: Collaborate with stakeholders).

## Reflection Questions

After completing these practice questions, reflect on the following:

1. **Earned Value Management**: Can you calculate and interpret CPI, SPI, EAC, and other EVM metrics? Do you understand when to use different EAC formulas?

2. **Change Control**: Do you understand when to use formal vs. expedited change processes? Can you balance governance with responsiveness?

3. **Variance Management**: Can you distinguish between acceptable variance and variance requiring corrective action? Do you know how to present options to stakeholders?

4. **Performance Metrics**: Can you differentiate leading indicators from lagging indicators? Do you understand which metrics predict future performance?

5. **Configuration Management**: Do you understand the importance of version control, traceability, and audit trails?

6. **Trade-Off Decisions**: Can you analyze options across multiple constraints (cost, schedule, risk, quality) and make recommendations based on business value?

7. **Closure**: Do you understand why closure activities are essential and not optional?

8. **Escalation**: Can you recognize when issues require escalation and how to escalate professionally?

If you struggled with any of these concepts, review the relevant sections in Chapter 14 before proceeding to the next chapter.
