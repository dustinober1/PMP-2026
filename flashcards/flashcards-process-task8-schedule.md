##  Schedule Fundamentals

### Card 1
**Front:**
What is the **Critical Path**?

**Back:**
The sequence of activities that represents the longest path through the project, which determines the shortest possible duration. It has **Zero Total Float**.

### Card 2
**Front:**
What is **Total Float** (Slack)?

**Back:**
The amount of time an activity can be delayed from its early start without delaying the planned project finish date.
Formula: **LS - ES** or **LF - EF**.

### Card 3
**Front:**
What is **Free Float**?

**Back:**
The amount of time an activity can be delayed without delaying the **Early Start** of any successor activity.

### Card 4
**Front:**
What is a **Milestone**?

**Back:**
A significant point or event in a project. It has **Zero Duration**.

### Card 5
**Front:**
What is the **Precedence Diagramming Method (PDM)**?

**Back:**
A technique used for constructing a schedule model in which activities are represented by nodes and are graphically linked by one or more logical relationships to show the sequence. (Activity-on-Node).

### Card 6
**Front:**
What is **Rolling Wave Planning**?

**Back:**
An iterative planning technique in which the work to be accomplished in the near term is planned in detail, while the work in the future is planned at a higher level.

### Card 7
**Front:**
What does **FS** (Finish-to-Start) mean?

**Back:**
A logical relationship in which potential work cannot start until a predecessor activity finishes. (The most common type).

### Card 8
**Front:**
What does **SS** (Start-to-Start) mean?

**Back:**
A relationship where a successor activity cannot start until a predecessor activity has started.

### Card 9
**Front:**
What does **FF** (Finish-to-Finish) mean?

**Back:**
A relationship where a successor activity cannot finish until a predecessor activity has finished.

### Card 10
**Front:**
What does **SF** (Start-to-Finish) mean?

**Back:**
A relationship where a successor activity cannot finish until a predecessor activity has started. (Rare; e.g., the first shift cannot finish until the second shift starts).

##  Schedule Logic & Leads/Lags

### Card 11
**Front:**
What is **Lag**?

**Back:**
The amount of time a successor activity will be delayed with respect to a predecessor activity. (Waiting time, e.g., paint drying).

### Card 12
**Front:**
What is **Lead**?

**Back:**
The amount of time a successor activity can be advanced with respect to a predecessor activity. (Overlap, e.g., starting to write Chapter 2 before Chapter 1 is 100% finished).

### Card 13
**Front:**
What is **Mandatory Dependency** (Hard Logic)?

**Back:**
A relationship that is contractually required or inherent in the nature of the work (e.g., must pour foundation before building walls).

### Card 14
**Front:**
What is **Discretionary Dependency** (Soft Logic)?

**Back:**
A relationship that is established based on knowledge of best practices or some unusual aspect of the project. (e.g., "We *prefer* to paint the walls before installing the carpet").

### Card 15
**Front:**
What is **External Dependency**?

**Back:**
A relationship between project activities and non-project activities (e.g., waiting for a government hearing). Usually outside the control of the team.

### Card 16
**Front:**
What is **Internal Dependency**?

**Back:**
A relationship between project activities that are generally inside the project team's control.

### Card 17
**Front:**
What is the **Forward Pass**?

**Back:**
A critical path method for calculating the Early Start and Early Finish dates by working forward through the schedule model.

### Card 18
**Front:**
What is the **Backward Pass**?

**Back:**
A critical path method for calculating the Late Start and Late Finish dates by working backward through the schedule model.

### Card 19
**Front:**
How do you calculate **Project Diagram Duration**?

**Back:**
It is equal to the duration of the **Critical Path**.

### Card 20
**Front:**
If an activity has **Negative Float**, what does it mean?

**Back:**
The planned finish date is *after* the imposed deadline (e.g., the Customer requires it by Dec 1, but the schedule says Dec 5). The project is late before it starts.

---

##  Schedule Compression

### Card 21
**Front:**
What is **Crashing**?

**Back:**
Adding resources to critical path activities to shorten the schedule. It usually increases **Cost** (e.g., paying overtime).

### Card 22
**Front:**
What is **Fast Tracking**?

**Back:**
Performing activities in parallel that were originally planned in sequence. It usually increases **Risk** (of rework).

### Card 23
**Front:**
Does **Crashing** work on non-critical activities?

**Back:**
**No**. Shortening a non-critical task does not shorten the project duration; it just increases the float of that task.

### Card 24
**Front:**
What is the main risk of **Fast Tracking**?

**Back:**
**Rework**. If you start the foundation before the blueprints are approved, you might have to tear it up later.

### Card 25
**Front:**
**Scenario**: You are behind schedule. You have no extra money. Which compression technique is viable?

**Back:**
**Fast Tracking**. (Crashing requires money).

### Card 26
**Front:**
**Scenario**: You are behind schedule. The deadline is firm. You have budget reserves. Which technique is viable?

**Back:**
**Crashing**. (It's safer than Fast Tracking if you have the cash).

### Card 27
**Front:**
What is **Resource Leveling**?

**Back:**
A technique in which start and finish dates are adjusted based on resource constraints. It typically **lengthens** the schedule.

### Card 28
**Front:**
What is **Resource Smoothing**?

**Back:**
A technique that adjusts the activities of a schedule model such that the requirements for resources on the project do not exceed certain predefined resource limits. It operates only within the limits of **Float**, so it does **not** change the project end date.

### Card 29
**Front:**
What is the **Law of Diminishing Returns** in Crashing?

**Back:**
Adding more resources eventually yields less output per unit (e.g., too many cooks in the kitchen). Crashing isn't linear.

### Card 30
**Front:**
What is **Monte Carlo Analysis** for Schedule?

**Back:**
A simulation that runs thousands of possible project scenarios to calculate the probability of finishing by a certain date.

##  Agile Scheduling

### Card 31
**Front:**
What is the primary unit of schedule planning in Scrum?

**Back:**
The **Sprint** (or Iteration), typically 1-4 weeks long.

### Card 32
**Front:**
What is **Velocity**?

**Back:**
A measure of the amount of work a team can tackle during a single Sprint (e.g., 20 Story Points).

### Card 33
**Front:**
What is a **Release Plan**?

**Back:**
A high-level schedule that indicates which features will be available at the end of each release (which may span multiple Sprints).

### Card 34
**Front:**
What is a **Burndown Chart**?

**Back:**
A graphical representation of work left to do versus time. Ideally, it trends down to zero by the end of the Sprint/Project.

### Card 35
**Front:**
What is a **Burnup Chart**?

**Back:**
A chart showing the total scope (work to be done) and the work completed. It is useful for showing when scope is added (the total scope line rises).

### Card 36
**Front:**
What is **Timeboxing**?

**Back:**
Setting a fixed time period for an activity (e.g., a one-hour meeting, a two-week sprint). If work isn't done, the box still closes.

### Card 37
**Front:**
What is **Adaptive Planning**?

**Back:**
Changing the plan as new information becomes available (Agile Principle: Responding to change over following a plan).

### Card 38
**Front:**
How do you calculate **Sprints Required**?

**Back:**
Total Story Points in Backlog / Average Velocity. (e.g., 100 points / 20 points per sprint = 5 Sprints).

### Card 39
**Front:**
What is the **Daily Scrum**?

**Back:**
A 15-minute timeboxed event for the Development Team to synchronize activities and create a plan for the next 24 hours.

### Card 40
**Front:**
Does Agile use Critical Path?

**Back:**
Generally **No**. Agile focuses on flow and prioritizing the backlog rather than a strict dependency network, although dependencies still exist.

##  Scenarios: Managing the Timeline

### Card 41
**Front:**
**Scenario**: An activity has Total Float of 5 days and Free Float of 2 days. If you delay it by 4 days, what happens?

It creates a **delay for the successor**, but the **Project End Date is safe**. (Passed Free Float limit, but within Total Float limit).

### Card 42
**Front:**
**Scenario**: The client demands a change that adds 2 days to a critical path activity. What is the impact?

**Back:**
The project end date acts delayed by **2 days** (unless you Compress).

### Card 43
**Front:**
**Scenario**: A team member suggests doing two tasks at once to catch up. What is this called?

**Back:**
**Three-Point Estimating** (or Expert Judgment).

### Card 45
**Front:**
**Scenario**: You are estimating a task where you have tons of data and it's very repetitive (e.g., installing 1000 standard windows). Which method is best?

**Back:**
**Parametric Estimating**.

### Card 46
**Front:**
**Scenario**: A resource is over-allocated, but you cannot delay the project finish date. Which optimization technique do you use?

**Back:**
**Resource Smoothing**. (It only adjusts non-critical activities).

### Card 47
**Front:**
**Scenario**: Your Burndown chart has a "flat line" for 5 days. What does this mean?

**Back:**
No work was completed/closed during those 5 days.

### Card 48
**Front:**
**Scenario**: The customer wants to move the deadline up by 2 weeks. What is the first thing you check?

**Back:**
The **Critical Path**. You need to see which activities drive the duration to know if it's feasible.

### Card 49
**Front:**
**Scenario**: An activity on the Critical Path is completed 2 days early. What happens to the project float?

**Back:**
The project now has **2 days of positive float** (or forces an earlier finish).

### Card 50
**Front:**
**Scenario**: You are managing a software project. A developer says "I can't start the UI until the API is done." What dependency is this?

**Back:**
**Finish-to-Start (FS)**. It is likely a **Mandatory** dependency (Hard Logic).

##  Quick-Fire Schedule Review

### Card 71
**Front:**
**True or False**: A project can have multiple Critical Paths.

**Back:**
**True**. If two paths have the exact same duration and are the longest, both are critical. (This increases Risk).
