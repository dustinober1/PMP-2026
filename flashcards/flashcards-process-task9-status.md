##  EVM Forecasting & Analysis

### Card 11
**Front:**

**Front:**
What is **Variance Analysis**?

**Back:**
A technique for determining the cause and degree of difference between the baseline and actual performance.

### Card 13
**Front:**
**Scenario**: You have a CPI of 1.2 and SPI of 0.8. What should you report?

### Card 49
**Front:**
**Scenario**: A team member finds a defect. They fix it immediately. Do you need a Change Request?

**Back:**
If it is during development (before baseline/acceptance), usually **No**. If it is a fix to a baselined deliverable or production system, **Yes** (Defect Repair).

### Card 50
**Front:**
**Scenario**: The project status is "Green" but the Customer is unhappy. What is the problem?
