**Task**: Help ensure value-based delivery
**ECO Reference**: Process Task 3

---

##  Value Concepts & Definitions

### Card 1
**Front:**
What is the difference between an **Output** and an **Outcome**?

**Back:**
-   **Output**: The tangible deliverable created (e.g., A new software app).
-   **Outcome**: The result or behavioral change achieved by using the output (e.g., Customers can now book flights 50% faster).

### Card 2
**Front:**
What is a **Benefit** in project management?

**Back:**
The measurable value (financial or non-financial) that realization of outcomes provides to the organization (e.g., $1M increased revenue).

### Card 3
**Front:**
What is the primary purpose of the **Business Case**?

**Back:**
To document the economic feasibility of a potential initiative and justify why the project is worth the investment. It answers "Why are we doing this?"

### Card 4
**Front:**
What is a **Benefits Management Plan**?

**Back:**
A document that describes how and when the project's benefits will be delivered, measured, and sustained. It defines the metrics and the **Benefits Owner**.

### Card 5
**Front:**
What is the **Sunk Cost Fallacy**?

**Back:**
The incorrect belief that you should continue a failing project because you have already spent a lot of money on it.
*Correct Approach*: Ignore sunk costs; look only at future costs vs. future benefits.

### Card 6
**Front:**
What is **Net Present Value (NPV)**?

**Back:**
The difference between the present value of cash inflows and the present value of cash outflows over a period of time. It accounts for the time value of money.

### Card 7
**Front:**
If Project A has an NPV of $50,000 and Project B has an NPV of $80,000, which one should you choose?

**Back:**
**Project B**. A higher NPV indicates greater financial value.

### Card 8
**Front:**
What is **Internal Rate of Return (IRR)**?

**Back:**
The projected annual yield (interest rate) of a project investment. Generally, a higher IRR is better.

### Card 9
**Front:**
What is the **Benefit-Cost Ratio (BCR)**?

**Back:**
The relationship between the benefits and costs of a project.
-   BCR > 1.0: Benefits outweigh costs (Good).
-   BCR < 1.0: Costs outweigh benefits (Bad).

### Card 10
**Front:**
What is **Payback Period**?

**Back:**
The amount of time it takes to recover the initial investment. A shorter payback period is generally preferred (less risk).

##  Agile Value Delivery

### Card 11
**Front:**
What is a **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**?

**Back:**
The smallest version of a product that allows the team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least effort. Focused on **Risk Reduction/Learning**.

### Card 12
**Front:**
What is a **Minimum Business Increment (MBI)**?

**Back:**
The smallest piece of value that can be released to a customer to generate actual value (revenue/savings). Focused on **Return on Investment**.

### Card 13
**Front:**
What is **Incremental Delivery**?

**Back:**
Delivering working software/products in small, usable pieces throughout the project lifecycle, rather than a single "Big Bang" release at the end.

### Card 14
**Front:**
What is the **Cost of Delay**?

**Back:**
The financial or strategic impact of delaying value delivery. In Agile, we prioritize work to minimize this cost (e.g., releasing a holiday feature before Christmas).

### Card 15
**Front:**
What is **Weighted Shortest Job First (WSJF)**?

**Back:**
A prioritization method (used in SAFe) calculated by dividing the **Cost of Delay** by the **Job Duration/Size**. It prioritizes high-value, short-duration tasks.

### Card 16
**Front:**
How does the **Kano Model** categorize requirements?

**Back:**
1.  **Basic Needs** (Must-haves; absence causes dissatisfaction).
2.  **Performance Needs** (Linear value; more is better).
3.  **Delighters** (Unexpected value; creates excitement).

### Card 17
**Front:**
What is a **Feedback Loop** in value delivery?

**Back:**
A cycle where output is delivered, used by customers, and feedback is returned to the team to adjust future work. (e.g., Sprint Reviews).

### Card 18
**Front:**
Why does Agile prefer **Leading Indicators** over **Lagging Indicators**?

**Back:**
Leading indicators (e.g., user adoption trends) allow the team to pivot *during* the project, whereas lagging indicators (e.g., final ROI) only tell you the result after it's too late to change it.

### Card 19
**Front:**
What is the role of the **Product Owner** regarding value?

**Back:**
They are accountable for **maximizing validity**. They do this by prioritizing the backlog items that deliver the highest value soonest.

### Card 20
**Front:**
What is **Value Stream Mapping**?

**Back:**
A Lean technique used to document, analyze, and improve the flow of information or materials required to produce a product to a customer, specifically to identify **Waste**.

##  Delivering & Measuring Value

### Card 21
**Front:**
What is **Requirement Verification** vs. **Validation**?

**Back:**
-   **Verification**: "Did we build the product right?" (Meets specs).
-   **Validation**: "Did we build the right product?" (Meets business needs/value).

### Card 22
**Front:**
What is the **Net Promoter Score (NPS)**?

**Back:**
A metric that measures customer loyalty by asking: "How likely are you to recommend us to a friend?"
*Formula: % Promoters - % Detractors.*

### Card 23
**Front:**
What are **OKRs** (Objectives and Key Results)?

**Back:**
A goal-setting framework used to define measurable goals and track their outcomes.
-   **Objective**: Qualitative goal.
-   **Key Result**: Quantitative measure.

### Card 24
**Front:**
What is a **Balanced Scorecard**?

**Back:**
A strategic management performance metric used to identify and improve various internal business functions and their resulting external outcomes (Financial, Customer, Internal Process, Learning/Growth).

### Card 25
**Front:**
What is **Opportunity Cost** in project selection?

**Back:**
The potential value of the *next best alternative* that you give up when you make a choice.

### Card 26
**Front:**
If a project is completed on time and budget but the customer refuses to use it, has the project delivered **Value**?

**Back:**
**No**. It delivered an output, but failed to deliver the outcome/benefit. It is technically a failure in value delivery.

### Card 27
**Front:**
What represents the "Triple Bottom Line" of value?

**Back:**
1.  **Profit** (Economic)
2.  **People** (Social)
3.  **Planet** (Environmental/Sustainability)

### Card 28
**Front:**
What is **Benefits Realization**?

**Back:**
The process of ensuring that the benefits defined in the Business Case are actually achieved and sustained after the project delivers its output.

### Card 29
**Front:**
Who is typically the **Benefits Owner**?

**Back:**
A stakeholder from the business side (e.g., Operations Manager) who is responsible for ensuring the deliverable generates value *after* the project team leaves.

### Card 30
**Front:**
What is **Return on Investment (ROI)** formula?

**Back:**
((Net Benefits - Costs) / Costs) x 100.

##  Scenarios: Value-Based Decisions

### Card 31
**Front:**
**Scenario**: You are midway through a project. A new competitor launches a product that makes your project's business case obsolete. What do you do?

**Back:**
Evaluate the impact and recommend **terminating the project**. Do not spend more money on a project that will yield zero value, even if it's "halfway done."

### Card 32
**Front:**
**Scenario**: A stakeholder requests a feature that "looks cool" but adds no business value and wasn't in the plan. What do you do?

**Back:**
Reject it or put it at the very bottom of the backlog. As a PM, you must guard against scope creep that dilutes the project's **Value Proposition**.

### Card 33
**Front:**
**Scenario**: Your project has a choice: deliver 100 features in 12 months, or deliver the top 20 features (80% of value) in 3 months. Which do you choose?

**Back:**
Advocate for the **3-month delivery**. Realizing 80% of the value early improves ROI and cash flow (Pareto Principle / Agile mindset).

### Card 34
**Front:**
**Scenario**: The finance team demands an NPV calculation for an Agile project where requirements are unclear. What do you do?

**Back:**
Use the best available data to estimate based on the **Product Vision** and **Roadmap**, but state the assumptions clearly. You can also focus on "Cost of Delay" to justify urgency.

### Card 35
**Front:**
**Scenario**: The team is "Gold Plating" by adding extra polish to code that the customer won't see or care about. Is this adding value?

**Back:**
**No**. It is adding **Waste** (Cost without Benefit). Stop the practice and focus on what the customer values.

### Card 36
**Front:**
**Scenario**: You are prioritizing a list of risks. Risk A has a $10k impact. Risk B has a $50k impact. Both have 10% probability. Which do you address first?

**Back:**
**Risk B**. Its Expected Monetary Value (EMV) is higher ($5k vs $1k). Value-based delivery also applies to protecting value (Risk Management).

### Card 37
**Front:**
**Scenario**: Stakeholders are happy with the weekly demos, but the Beta launch shows zero adoption. What is the disconnect?

**Back:**
The project verified the requirements (demos) but failed **Validation** (market fit). You need to pivot immediately to understand why users aren't adopting.

### Card 38
**Front:**
**Scenario**: A project has a BCR of 0.8. The Sponsor wants to approve it because it helps a strategic partnership. Is this valid?

**Back:**
**Yes**. Financial metrics aren't the only form of value. **Strategic Alignment** (intangible benefit) can justify a negative financial return.

### Card 39
**Front:**
**Scenario**: Project A payback is 6 months. Project B payback is 2 years. All other things equal, which do you pick?

**Back:**
**Project A**. Recovering investment faster frees up capital for other investments (Velocity of Capital).

### Card 40
**Front:**
**Scenario**: Your team is working on low-priority bug fixes while a major revenue-generating feature sits in the backlog. What should happen?

**Back:**
The **Product Owner** needs to reprioritize. The team should always work on the highest value items (Revenue) before lower value items (minor bugs), unless the bugs block the value.

##  Tools & Techniques

### Card 41
**Front:**
What is **Evaluation of Options**?

**Back:**
A technique in the Business Case where you compare different approaches (e.g., Build vs. Buy, Do Nothing vs. Do Project) to see which yields the highest value.

### Card 42
**Front:**
What is **Product Roadmapping**?

**Back:**
Visualizing the high-level timeline of major releases and features to communicate the **Strategic Direction** and value drops to stakeholders.

### Card 43
**Front:**
What is a **Needs Assessment**?

**Back:**
A pre-project task to analyze current business problems or opportunities and determine if a project is necessary to close the gap.

### Card 44
**Front:**
What is **Information Radiator**?

**Back:**
Displaying value metrics (like Burnup Charts showing value delivered) in a visible place to keep the team focused on outcomes.

### Card 45
**Front:**
What is **A/B Testing**?

**Back:**
A method of comparing two versions of a product against each other to determine which one performs better (delivers more value/conversion).

### Card 46
**Front:**
What is the role of **ESG** (Environmental, Social, and Governance) in value delivery?

**Back:**
It acts as a constraint or success criterion. Modern value delivery must ensure the project is sustainable and ethical, not just profitable.

### Card 47
**Front:**
What is **Waste** (Muda) in Lean/Agile?

**Back:**
Any activity that consumes resources but creates no value for the customer.
*Examples: Extra features, waiting, task switching, defects.*

### Card 48
**Front:**
What is **Pareto Analysis** (80/20 Rule)?

**Back:**
The idea that 80% of the value comes from 20% of the features. Value-based delivery focuses on finding and building that 20% first.

### Card 49
**Front:**
What is **Backlog Refinement**'s role in value?

**Back:**
It ensures the implementation team understands the "Why" (Value) behind user stories, allowing them to suggest better/cheaper solutions.

### Card 50
**Front:**
What is a **Murder Board**?

**Back:**
A committee that asks tough questions to "kill" projects that don't have a solid business case or value proposition before they consume too many resources.

##  Quick-Fire Value Review

### Card 51
**Front:**
**True or False**: A project with a negative ROI should never be approved.

**Back:**
**False**. It might be approved for legal compliance or critical safety reasons (Constraints).

### Card 52
**Front:**
**True or False**: The Project Manager is responsible for defining the Business Case.

**Back:**
**False**. The Sponsor or Business Analyst usually writes it; the PM may provide input but typically executes against it.

### Card 53
**Front:**
**True or False**: Tangible benefits are the only ones that matter.

**Back:**
**False**. Intangible benefits (Brand, Morale) are often the primary drivers of strategic value.

### Card 54
**Front:**
**True or False**: Value is realized only at the end of the project.

**Back:**
**False** (especially in Agile). Value should be realized incrementally throughout the project lifecycle via releases.

### Card 55
**Front:**
**True or False**: If the Business Case changes, the project may need to change or stop.

**Back:**
**True**. The project is authorized based on the Business Case. If that foundation cracks, the project must be re-evaluated.

### Card 56
**Front:**
Which measures "Customer Satisfaction" directly?

**Back:**
**NPS (Net Promoter Score)** or **CSAT (Customer Satisfaction Score)**.

### Card 57
**Front:**
What does a **Burnup Chart** show that a Burndown chart doesn't?

**Back:**
It shows the **Total Scope** line. This helps stakeholders see if the team isn't finishing because they are slow or because the scope keeps growing (Value Request vs Scope Creep).

### Card 58
**Front:**
What is the formula for **Present Value (PV)**?

**Back:**
Future Value / (1 + interest rate)^n.
*Concept: Money today is worth more than money tomorrow.*

### Card 59
**Front:**
What is **Continuous Delivery**?

**Back:**
A software engineering approach in which teams produce software in short cycles, ensuring that the software can be released at any time.

### Card 60
**Front:**
What is the **Project Charter** regarding value?

**Back:**
It allows the project to exist. It translates the Business Case value into high-level project objectives and success criteria.

##  Closing & Transition

### Card 61
**Front:**
When does the PM's responsibility for Value end?

**Back:**
Typically at the **Transition to Operations**, though the PM may assist in measuring initial benefits during closure. The Business Owner takes over long-term realization.

### Card 62
**Front:**
What is a **Post-Implementation Review**?

**Back:**
A defined period after the project closes to evaluate if the expected benefits (ROI, outcome changes) actually happened.

### Card 63
**Front:**
If a project is cancelled, should you still archive the work?

**Back:**
**Yes**. The "Value" in a cancelled project is the **Lessons Learned** and any reusable components (Outputs) for future projects.

### Card 64
**Front:**
How do you measure **Strategic Alignment**?

**Back:**
Often through a **Weighted Scoring Model** where projects are scored against strategic pillars (e.g., "Supports Global Expansion: Yes/No").

### Card 65
**Front:**
What is **Churn Rate**?

**Back:**
The percentage of customers who stop using your product. High churn kills value (ROI) even if you are acquiring new customers.

### Card 66
**Front:**
How does **Automation** create value?

**Back:**
By reducing ongoing operational costs (OpEx) and increasing speed/quality (fewer manual errors).

### Card 67
**Front:**
What is a **Value Proposition**?

**Back:**
A statement that summarizes why a consumer should buy a product or use a service.

### Card 68
**Front:**
What is **ADKAR**?

**Back:**
A change management model (Awareness, Desire, Knowledge, Ability, Reinforcement) used to ensure adoption, which is required for value realization.

### Card 69
**Front:**
What is **Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)**?

**Back:**
The purchase price of an asset plus the costs of operation (maintenance, support, upgrades) over its entire life.

### Card 70
**Front:**
How does project **Governance** protect value?

**Back:**
By providing stage-gate reviews where the Sponsor/Board can stop a project that is no longer viable, preserving resources for other value-add activities.

### Card 72
**Front:**
What is the **Product Vision Board**?

**Back:**
A tool that captures the vision, target group, user needs, product features, and business value in a single snapshot.

### Card 73
**Front:**
What is **Impact Mapping**?

**Back:**
A strategic planning technique that visually maps business goals -> actors -> impacts -> deliverables. It ensures every deliverable serves a goal.

### Card 74
**Front:**
What is **Cost-Benefit Analysis**?

**Back:**

### Card 75
**Front:**
What is **Market Analysis**?

**Back:**
Assessing the market size, competition, and trends to validate that the "Value" assumed in the Business Case is realistic.

### Card 76
**Front:**
What is **Usability Testing**?

**Back:**
Observing users as they attempt to complete tasks. It validates if the "Outcome" (ability to do work) is actually achieved.

### Card 77
**Front:**
What is **Technical Debt**?

**Back:**
The implied cost of additional reuse work caused by choosing an easy (limited) solution now instead of a better approach that would take longer. High debt destroys future value.

### Card 78
**Front:**
What is an **Epic**?

**Back:**
A large body of work that can be broken down into specific tasks (called user stories) based on the needs/requests of customers or end-users.

### Card 79
**Front:**
What is **Feature Injection**?

**Back:**
An approach where you only pull features into the scope if they are absolutely proven to deliver the desired value outcome (minimizing waste).

### Card 80
**Front:**
What is **Scenario Planning**?

**Back:**
Making assumptions on what the future is going to be and how your business environment will change over time in light of that future. Used to stress-test value assumptions.
