4. **Error Log**: Keep a list of concepts you get wrong and review them regularly.

### Must-Memorize Items
- **Domain Weights**: People 33%, Process 41%, Business Environment 26%
- **Agile Manifesto**: 4 values, 12 principles
- **Conflict Resolution Order**: Collaborate > Compromise > Smooth > Force > Avoid
- **Risk Responses**: Threats (Avoid, Mitigate, Transfer, Accept), Opportunities (Exploit, Enhance, Share, Accept)
- **EVM Formulas**: All formulas listed in Week 4

- **Protect study time**: Treat it like a work commitment
- **Use commute time**: Review flashcards, listen to audio summaries

### When You're Running Behind
If you fall behind schedule:
1. **Prioritize Process domain** (41% of exam) - don't skip Week 3-4
2. **Focus on must-read sections only** - skip "nice to know" content
3. **Increase practice questions** - learning through practice is efficient
4. **Extend to 7-8 weeks** if needed - better to be prepared than to rush
