## Study Tips and Best Practices

### Daily Study Habits
1. **Consistent Schedule**: Study at the same time each day when possible
2. **Active Learning**: Don't just read - take notes, create summaries, teach concepts to others
3. **Spaced Repetition**: Review previous week's content regularly
4. **Practice Questions**: Do questions daily, even if just 10-15
5. **Error Analysis**: Keep a log of concepts you get wrong and review them frequently

### Weekly Review Process
1. **Sunday Planning**: Review upcoming week's chapters and schedule study time
2. **Wednesday Check-in**: Assess progress and adjust if needed
3. **Saturday Summary**: Create summary notes of key concepts learned
4. **Checkpoint Assessment**: Complete practice questions and evaluate performance

### Memory Techniques
1. **Acronyms**: Create memorable acronyms for lists (e.g., ADKAR, RACI)
2. **Visual Aids**: Draw diagrams for complex concepts (stakeholder grids, process flows)
3. **Real-World Connections**: Relate concepts to your actual project experience
4. **Flashcards**: Create flashcards for formulas and key definitions
5. **Teaching**: Explain concepts to colleagues or study partners

## Must-Memorize Items

### Domain Weights
- People: 33% (~61 questions)
- Process: 41% (~76 questions)
- Business Environment: 26% (~48 questions)

### Agile Manifesto
**4 Values**:
1. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
2. Working software over comprehensive documentation
3. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
4. Responding to change over following a plan

**12 Principles**: (Know the themes - customer satisfaction, welcome change, frequent delivery, collaboration, motivated individuals, face-to-face communication, working software, sustainable pace, technical excellence, simplicity, self-organizing teams, reflection and adaptation)

### Conflict Resolution Styles (in order of preference)
1. Collaborate (Confront/Problem-solve) - Best, win-win
2. Compromise - Both parties give something up
3. Smooth (Accommodate) - Emphasize agreement, de-emphasize differences
4. Force (Direct) - Win-lose, use when quick decision needed
5. Avoid (Withdraw) - Worst, postpone or ignore

### Risk Response Strategies
**Threats** (negative risks):
- Avoid - Eliminate the threat
- Mitigate - Reduce probability or impact
- Transfer - Shift to third party (insurance, outsourcing)
- Accept - Acknowledge but don't act (active: contingency reserve; passive: do nothing)

**Opportunities** (positive risks):
- Exploit - Ensure opportunity happens
- Enhance - Increase probability or impact
- Share - Allocate to third party best able to capture
- Accept - Take advantage if it occurs

### EVM Formulas
- **CPI** = EV / AC (>1 = under budget)
- **SPI** = EV / PV (>1 = ahead of schedule)
- **CV** = EV - AC
- **SV** = EV - PV
- **EAC** = BAC / CPI (most common)
- **ETC** = EAC - AC
- **VAC** = BAC - EAC
- **TCPI** = (BAC - EV) / (BAC - AC) [for BAC]
- **TCPI** = (BAC - EV) / (EAC - AC) [for EAC]

### Other Key Formulas
- **Communication Channels** = n(n-1)/2
- **Three-Point Estimate** = (O + 4M + P) / 6
- **Standard Deviation** = (P - O) / 6

### Tuckman's Stages
1. Forming - Team comes together, polite, uncertain
2. Storming - Conflict emerges, competition for roles
3. Norming - Team establishes norms, cooperation increases
4. Performing - Team is productive, self-managing
5. Adjourning - Team disbands, celebrate achievements

### ADKAR Model
- **A**wareness of need for change
- **D**esire to support the change
- **K**nowledge of how to change
- **A**bility to implement change
- **R**einforcement to sustain change

### Kotter's 8 Steps
1. Create urgency
2. Build guiding coalition
3. Form strategic vision
4. Communicate vision
5. Empower action
6. Create short-term wins
7. Consolidate gains
8. Anchor changes in culture

### PMI Code of Ethics
- **R**esponsibility
- **R**espect
- **F**airness
- **H**onesty

### Cynefin Framework
- **Clear** (Simple/Obvious) - Best practice, sense-categorize-respond
- **Complicated** - Good practice, sense-analyze-respond, experts needed
- **Complex** - Emergent practice, probe-sense-respond, experiments
- **Chaotic** - Novel practice, act-sense-respond, rapid action
- **Confused** - Don't know which domain you're in

## Domain-Specific Focus Areas

### People Domain (33%) - Chapters 6-9
**High-Frequency Topics**:
- Team development (Tuckman's stages)
- Conflict resolution styles and when to use each
- Leadership styles (servant leadership, transformational, situational)
- Stakeholder engagement strategies
- Communication planning and methods
- Motivation theories
- Coaching vs. mentoring vs. directing

**Common Question Patterns**:
- "What should the PM do FIRST?" → Usually engage stakeholders or gather information
- Team conflict scenarios → Choose collaborative approaches
- Stakeholder resistance → Understand concerns, communicate benefits
- Virtual team challenges → Focus on communication and trust-building

### Process Domain (41%) - Chapters 10-14, 23
**High-Frequency Topics**:
- EVM calculations and interpretation
- Risk identification and response selection
- Schedule management (critical path, float, compression)
- Change control processes
- Quality management (QA vs. QC)
- Requirements management
- Agile planning (backlogs, sprints, releases)

**Common Question Patterns**:
- EVM scenarios → Calculate indices, interpret results, recommend actions
- Risk scenarios → Identify appropriate response strategy
- Schedule problems → Determine critical path, recommend compression
- Change requests → Follow proper change control process
- Quality issues → Distinguish between QA (process) and QC (product) solutions

### Business Environment Domain (26%) - Chapters 15-18
**High-Frequency Topics**:
- Benefits realization vs. project delivery
- Strategy alignment and project selection
- Compliance and governance
- Organizational change management (ADKAR, Kotter)
- Sustainability and ESG considerations
- Portfolio vs. program vs. project
- PMO roles and types

**Common Question Patterns**:

- Strategy misalignment → Escalate and recommend realignment
- Change resistance → Use ADKAR to diagnose and address
- Governance questions → Follow established processes and escalation paths

## Adjusting the Plan

### If You Need to Extend to 14-16 Weeks
- Add one week after Week 6 for additional Process domain practice
- Add one week after Week 9 for additional Business Environment practice
- Add one week after Week 11 for a third practice exam
- Use extra time to strengthen weak areas identified in practice exams

### If You Need to Compress to 10 Weeks
- Combine Weeks 1-2 into one week (foundations)
- Combine Weeks 3-4 into one week (People domain)
- Keep Weeks 5-7 as planned (Process domain is largest)
- Combine Weeks 8-9 into one week (Business Environment)
- Keep Weeks 10-12 as planned (integration and practice)
- Increase daily study time to 12-15 hours per week

### If You're Falling Behind
1. **Prioritize Process domain** (41% of exam) - don't skip or rush
2. **Focus on must-read sections** - skip optional deep dives
3. **Increase practice questions** - learn through application
4. **Use weekends** - catch up on reading, do practice exams
5. **Extend timeline** - better to be prepared than to rush
