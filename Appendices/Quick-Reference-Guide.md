## Day Before Exam - Critical Review

### Must-Know Formulas (Top 10)

**Earned Value Management (Most Important)**
1. **CPI (Cost Performance Index)** = EV / AC
   - >1 = under budget, <1 = over budget
   - Example: CPI = 0.85 means 85 cents of value for every dollar spent

2. **SPI (Schedule Performance Index)** = EV / PV
   - >1 = ahead of schedule, <1 = behind schedule
   - Example: SPI = 1.2 means 20% ahead of schedule

3. **EAC (Estimate at Completion)** = BAC / CPI
   - Most common method for forecasting final cost
   - Example: If BAC = $100K and CPI = 0.8, then EAC = $125K

4. **TCPI (To-Complete Performance Index)** = (BAC - EV) / (BAC - AC)
   - Required cost efficiency on remaining work
   - >1 means you need better efficiency than originally planned

**Other Critical Formulas**
5. **Communication Channels** = n(n-1)/2
   - Where n = number of people
   - Example: 5 people = 5×4/2 = 10 channels

6. **Expected Monetary Value (EMV)** = Probability × Impact
   - For risk analysis and decision trees
   - Example: 30% chance of $50K loss = -$15K EMV

7. **Cost of Quality** = Cost of Conformance + Cost of Non-Conformance
   - Prevention + Appraisal + Internal Failure + External Failure

8. **Float/Slack** = LS - ES or LF - EF
   - Amount of time an activity can be delayed without affecting project end date
   - Critical path activities have zero float

9. **Critical Path** = Longest path through network diagram
   - Determines minimum project duration
   - Any delay on critical path delays entire project

10. **Three-Point Estimate** = (Optimistic + 4×Most Likely + Pessimistic) / 6
    - PERT formula for more accurate estimates
    - Provides weighted average with emphasis on most likely

### Common Exam Patterns

**"What should the PM do FIRST?"**
- Usually: Engage stakeholders, gather information, or assess the situation
- Rarely: Jump to solutions or take immediate action

**"What should the PM do NEXT?"**
- Usually: Communicate findings, escalate appropriately, or update plans
- Consider: Who needs to know? What decisions need to be made?

**When in doubt, choose the answer that:**
- Engages stakeholders proactively
- Communicates transparently and honestly
- Protects value and benefits, not just scope/schedule/cost
- Follows established processes (don't skip steps)
- Is proactive rather than reactive
- Considers long-term impact, not just short-term fixes

### Critical Success Mantras

**The PMI Way:**
- Engage stakeholders early and often
- Communicate transparently and proactively
- Protect value and benefits, not just scope/schedule/cost
- Follow established processes - don't skip steps
- Be proactive, not reactive
- Consider long-term impact, not just short-term fixes

**When Stuck, Ask:**
- Who are the stakeholders affected?
- What would a servant leader do?
- How does this protect/deliver value?
- What would be most transparent and ethical?
- Am I being proactive or reactive?

### Final Exam Day Reminders

**Physical Preparation:**
- Get a good night's sleep (7-8 hours)
- Eat a healthy breakfast with protein
- Arrive 30 minutes early to settle in
- Bring water and allowed snacks for breaks
- Dress comfortably in layers

**Time Management:**
- 240 minutes for 185 questions = ~1.3 minutes per question
- Aim for 75 seconds per question to leave buffer time
- Don't spend more than 2 minutes on any single question
- Use breaks strategically - stretch, hydrate, refocus

**Question Strategy:**
- Read the question first, then the scenario
- Identify the domain and core issue
- Look for keywords that signal the approach (predictive, agile, hybrid)
- Eliminate obviously wrong answers
- Choose the most PMI-aligned response

**Common Question Patterns:**
- "What should the PM do FIRST?" → Usually gather information or engage stakeholders
- "What should the PM do NEXT?" → Usually communicate or escalate appropriately
- "What is the BEST approach?" → Consider context and stakeholder needs
- Multiple good options → Choose the most proactive and stakeholder-focused

**Mindset:**
- Think like a responsible project leader, not a task manager
- Consider stakeholder impact in all decisions
- Balance competing constraints (scope, schedule, cost, quality, risk)
- Remember: You're delivering value, not just completing work
- Trust your preparation and experience

**Stay Calm:**
- You've prepared well - trust your knowledge
- If you don't know an answer, eliminate what you can and make your best guess
- Don't second-guess yourself excessively
- Focus on one question at a time
- Remember: You only need to pass, not get 100%

**Technical Reminders:**
- Save your work frequently if using computer-based testing
- Use the mark-for-review feature for questions you want to revisit
- Remember you cannot go back to previous sections after breaks
- Double-check your answers before moving to the next section

### You're Ready!

You've studied the concepts, practiced the scenarios, and learned to think like a PMP. Trust your preparation, stay calm, and remember that thousands of people pass this exam every year. You have the knowledge and experience to join them.

**Final confidence boosters:**
- You understand all three domains and their interconnections
- You can interpret EVM data and make appropriate decisions
- You know how to engage stakeholders and resolve conflicts
- You understand the importance of value delivery and strategic alignment
- You can adapt your approach based on project context

Go show them what you know. Good luck!
