### 4.6 Close Project or Phase

**Purpose**: Finalizing all activities across all Project Management Process Groups to formally complete the project or phase.

**Inputs:**
- Project charter
- Project management plan (All components)
- Accepted deliverables
- Business documents (Business case, Benefits management plan)
- Agreements
- Procurement documentation
- Organizational process assets (OPAs)

**Tools & Techniques:**
- Expert judgment
- Data analysis (Document analysis, Regression analysis, Trend analysis)
- Meetings
- Project management information system (PMIS)

**Outputs:**
- Final product, service, or result transition
- Final report
- Organization process assets updates (Project documents, Project closure documents, Lessons learned repository)

## Common ITTO Patterns and Relationships

### Frequently Used Inputs
1. **Project Management Plan**: Used in almost all processes
2. **Enterprise Environmental Factors (EEFs)**: Common input to most processes
3. **Organizational Process Assets (OPAs)**: Common input to most processes
4. **Project Documents**: Various documents used as inputs throughout

### Frequently Used Outputs
1. **Change Requests**: Output from many processes
2. **Project Documents Updates**: Output from many processes
3. **Project Management Plan Updates**: Output from many processes
4. **Lessons Learned Register**: Updated throughout the project

### Key ITTO Relationships
- **Outputs become inputs**: Most outputs from one process become inputs to another
- **Iterative nature**: Many processes are repeated throughout the project
- **Integration**: All processes are integrated and interdependent
- **Feedback loops**: Monitoring processes provide feedback to execution processes

### ITTO Memorization Tips
1. **Think logically**: What do you need to start? What do you produce?
2. **Group by Process Group**: Understand the flow within each group
3. **Focus on unique ITTOs**: Some processes have unique inputs or outputs
4. **Practice application**: Apply ITTOs to project scenarios
5. **Create mnemonics**: Develop memory aids for difficult concepts

## Process Group Flow and Interdependencies

```
Initiating → Planning → Executing → Monitoring & Controlling → Closing
     ↑_______________________↑_________________________↑
                    (Continuous throughout project)
```

### Key Integration Points
1. **Planning-Executing**: Plans guide execution
2. **Executing-Monitoring**: Execution is monitored and controlled
3. **Monitoring-Planning**: Monitoring results inform plan updates
4. **Closing-Monitoring**: Final verification during closure
5. **All Processes**: All processes may occur throughout the project
