# 3.1 – Building and Leading Teams

## Overview

The "People" domain accounts for 42% of the PMP exam (under the 2021 ECO, now 33% under the 2026 ECO), emphasizing the shift from "command and control" to "servant leadership." This section covers the core mechanics of building effective teams.

### Key Concepts

1.  **Team Formation:** Moving from a group of individuals to a high-performing team.
2.  **Roles and Authority:** Defining who does what and how decisions are made.
3.  **Conflict Management:** Turning disagreement into constructive problem-solving.
4.  **Servant Leadership:** The leader's role is to remove blockers and enable the team.

### Structure

*   **3.1a – Team Composition and Development:** Understanding Tuckman's ladder (Forming, Storming, Norming, Performing, Adjourning).
*   **3.1b – Roles and Responsibilities:** Using tools like RACI charts and Team Charters.
*   **3.1c – Influence and Power:** Leading without formal authority.
*   **3.1d – Conflict Resolution:** The five conflict modes (Collaborate, Compromise, Smooth, Force, Withdraw).
*   **3.1e – Motivation:** Intrinsic vs. extrinsic motivation (Maslow, Herzberg, McGregor).
*   **3.1f – Servant Leadership:** Core principles for agile and hybrid environments.

    *   B) Force/Direct
    *   C) Smooth/Accommodate

    *   B) Storming
    *   C) Norming
