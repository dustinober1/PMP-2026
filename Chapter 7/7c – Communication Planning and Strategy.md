# 7c – Communication Planning and Strategy

With stakeholders identified and expectations clarified, Sarah faces the next challenge: *How do I communicate with all these different people, with different needs, interests, and preferences, in a way that keeps everyone informed without overwhelming them?*

She realizes that "sending emails" is not a communication strategy. Emailing 40 people every day with project updates reaches everyone but helps no one. Important information gets lost. People tune out. Stakeholders who need detailed information do not get it. Stakeholders who do not care get pestered.

This section is about designing a **communication strategy**—a deliberate approach to what gets communicated, to whom, when, through what channel, and with what purpose.

---

## 7.1 The Purpose of Communication

Before designing a communication plan, Sarah clarifies *why* she is communicating. Communication in a project serves multiple purposes:

### 7.1.1 Different Purposes for Different Stakeholders

**Keep stakeholders informed**:
- Goal: Stakeholders know what is happening, understand progress, understand risks
- Example: Monthly status updates to executives; weekly updates to core team

**Get stakeholder input and feedback**:
- Goal: Gather information, validate assumptions, get approval for decisions
- Example: Weekly architecture reviews with IT; bi-weekly design reviews with finance team

**Build alignment and commitment**:
- Goal: Stakeholders understand the vision, buy into the approach, commit to supporting it
- Example: Kickoff presentation; transformation roadshow; pilot team alignment sessions

**Manage expectations**:
- Goal: Clarify what is expected, reset expectations if reality changes, prevent surprises
- Example: "This is not in scope"; "Timeline is slipping to May"; "This will require training"

**Build relationships and trust**:
- Goal: Stakeholders feel heard, respected, valued. Trust that you are being honest
- Example: One-on-one conversations; listening sessions; transparent discussions of risks and challenges

**Celebrate progress and maintain morale**:
- Goal: Acknowledge wins, recognize contributions, maintain momentum and energy
- Example: "We launched the beta this week!"; "Thanks to the pilot teams for their feedback"; "We are on track for March delivery"

Sarah learns that each communication should serve a purpose. Generic updates that just convey status information are less valuable than communications that serve one of these deeper purposes.

## 7.2 Communication Planning Process

Sarah develops a structured approach to communication planning:

### 7.2.1 Analyze Information Needs

**For each stakeholder or stakeholder group, ask:**

1. **What do they need to know?**
   - Status and progress (where are we in the project?)
   - Decisions and approvals (what is being decided and why?)
   - Changes and risks (what is changing, what might go wrong?)
   - Impact and implications (how does this affect them?)
   - Calls to action (what do we need from them?)

2. **How much detail do they need?**
   - **Executive summary**: High-level status, key risks, decisions needed (1-2 pages)
   - **Detailed update**: Technical status, progress against plan, issue log (5-10 pages)
   - **Deep dive**: Technical details, analysis, options, recommendations (20+ pages)

3. **How frequently do they need to hear?**
   - Daily (core team, critical path)
   - Weekly (active stakeholders, team leads)
   - Bi-weekly (engaged stakeholders)
   - Monthly (secondary stakeholders, keep-informed group)
   - Quarterly (low-interest stakeholders, monitor group)
   - Ad-hoc (when decisions need to be made, risks materialize, surprises happen)

**Sarah's analysis for the Expense System project**:

| Stakeholder | What | Detail | Frequency |
|---|---|---|---|
| CFO (Product Owner) | Status, scope decisions, risks | Executive summary + decision docs | Weekly (standup) + ad-hoc |
| Finance Manager | Status, requirements, design | Detailed update (specifications, demos) | Weekly (standup) + bi-weekly design review |
| Developers | Requirements, design, integration points, blockers | Detailed technical info | Daily (standup) + technical docs |
| Accounting Team | How it affects their work, timeline for rollout, training | Impact summaries, training plans | Monthly check-ins + pre-launch ramp-up |
| IT Director | Architecture, infrastructure, deployment plan, go-live risks | Technical details, deployment docs | Monthly reviews + pre-launch escalations |
| Department Managers | What it does, when it launches, impact on their teams | Business summary, timeline, training plan | Quarterly updates + 1 month before launch |

### 7.2.2 Design the Communication Strategy

For each information need and audience, decide:

**WHO**: Which stakeholder or stakeholder group?
**WHAT**: What specific message or information?
**WHY**: What is the purpose? (Inform, get input, build alignment, manage expectations, celebrate)
**WHEN**: How often? When in the project lifecycle?
**HOW**: What channel/format? (Meeting, email, document, presentation, one-on-one)
**HOW MUCH**: How much detail/length?
**SUCCESS MEASURE**: How will you know this communication worked? (Stakeholder understood? Responded? Took action?)

---

## 7.3 Communication Channels and Formats

Different channels serve different purposes and reach different audiences.

### 7.3.1 Synchronous Channels (Real-Time Communication)

**In-person meetings**
- **When to use**: Decisions that need discussion, conflicts that need resolving, important news that should come from you directly, relationship-building
- **Strengths**: Rich communication (see reactions, ask follow-up questions, build connection), fast feedback loops
- **Weaknesses**: Expensive (requires everyone to be available at one time), harder to document, not everyone can attend, sometimes less comfortable for people to speak up
- **Examples from Sarah's work**: Weekly project standups, steering committee meetings, one-on-one stakeholder conversations

**Synchronous video (Zoom, Teams, etc.)**
- **When to use**: Distributed teams, people working remotely, need for visual/tone connection but not in-person
- **Strengths**: More accessible than in-person (people can join from anywhere), still provides visual and tone cues
- **Weaknesses**: Zoom fatigue, people multi-tasking, still requires specific time slot
- **Examples**: Weekly team standups, remote stakeholder reviews, all-hands updates

**Phone/quick conversation**
- **When to use**: Quick clarifications, urgent issues, sensitive topics best discussed one-on-one, decisions that need immediate response
- **Strengths**: Fast, synchronous, personal
- **Weaknesses**: No record unless documented after, interrupts workflow, requires availability
- **Examples**: Escalation calls, quick clarifications, important conversations that need human voice

### 7.3.2 Asynchronous Channels (Documented Communication)

**Email**
- **When to use**: Decisions that should be documented, information that people need to have time to digest, updates for people in different time zones
- **Strengths**: Creates a record, people can read when convenient, works across time zones
- **Weaknesses**: Easy to miss, can get lost in inbox, does not allow for immediate feedback or clarification
- **Best practice**: Clear subject line, key points at top, background details if needed, clear call to action
- **Example**: "Decision: We are extending the timeline to May 15. Scope unchanged. Here is why: [explanation]. Questions? Let me know by Friday."

**Written documents and reports**
- **When to use**: Detailed information, technical specifications, project plans, lessons learned, formal approvals
- **Strengths**: Comprehensive, creates a reference document, shows thoroughness, good for audit trail
- **Weaknesses**: Takes time to write and read, easy to make too long, people may not read unless forced to
- **Best practice**: Executive summary at top; detailed sections for people who need them; links to more information if needed
- **Example**: Monthly status report, project plan, risk register, stakeholder analysis

**Portal/dashboard (shared workspace)**
- **When to use**: Ongoing information that people need to reference, status tracking, team collaboration
- **Strengths**: Central place for information, people can check anytime, creates transparency
- **Weaknesses**: Only works if people regularly check it, easy to create information overload
- **Best practice**: Keep it updated; use visual indicators (red/yellow/green status); curate so people can find what they need
- **Example**: Project dashboard in Jira, SharePoint site with key documents, OneNote shared notebook

**Announcements and broadcast (company newsletter, slack channel, etc.)**
- **When to use**: Updates that affect a large audience, celebrating wins, keeping organization informed
- **Strengths**: Reaches many people, creates visibility and awareness
- **Weaknesses**: Not guaranteed anyone reads it, easy to tune out, not good for important decisions that need confirmation of understanding
- **Best practice**: Keep it brief, highlight key points, link to more detailed info, use this to amplify stakeholder announcements
- **Example**: "Expense System launched today! Check #expense-system channel for training and support. FAQ at [link]"

### 7.3.3 Mixed Strategies

Most projects use a combination:

**Sarah's Communication Mix for Expense System**:

| Audience | Information Needs | Channels | Frequency |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Core Team** | Daily progress, blockers, decisions, scope changes | Daily standup (in-person), Slack/Teams chat, shared task board | Daily |
| **CFO** | Status, decisions needed, risks/issues | Weekly standup meeting (video), weekly decision memo (email), monthly steering committee | Weekly + monthly |
| **Finance Manager** | Requirements, design, feedback incorporation | Bi-weekly design review meeting, design docs (email/portal), daily slack for quick Q&A | Bi-weekly review + async |
| **IT Director** | Architecture, infrastructure, deployment | Monthly architecture review meeting, deployment plan doc, pre-launch escalations | Monthly + as-needed |
| **Accounting Team** | Impact on their work, training, timeline | Monthly update email, training sessions (pre-launch), quick reference guide (document) | Monthly + training plan |
| **All Stakeholders** | Go-live announcement, success celebration | Company announcement, email to all, kick-off training | Launch day + 1 week |

---

## 7.4 Communication Plan Documentation

Sarah creates a **Communication Plan**—a document that ensures everyone knows what to expect and what is communicated where.

A simple Communication Plan template includes:

**Section 1: Overview**
- Project name, dates, key stakeholders
- Communication goals (what are we trying to achieve?)
- Communication principles (e.g., "We communicate early, often, and honestly"; "We involve stakeholders in decisions that affect them")

**Section 2: Stakeholder Communication Matrix**

| Stakeholder / Group | What Info | Frequency | Channel(s) | Owner | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CFO | Status, decisions, risks | Weekly | Standup meeting, email memos | PM | Keep satisfied, get approvals |
| Finance Team | Status, requirements, design feedback | Bi-weekly | Meetings, demos | PM + Tech Lead | Get input, build alignment |
| Accounting Team | Go-live plans, training, support | Monthly, then ramp-up | Email, training sessions | PM + Finance Manager | Manage expectations, prepare for change |

**Section 3: Key Messages by Phase**

*Project Kickoff*:
- "We are launching this project to [business case]. Success looks like [outcome]."
- "We will iterate and get feedback. Your input shapes the outcome."
- "Timeline is [date]. That is our commitment."

*Mid-Project*:
- "We are on track / Behind schedule / Encountering challenges"
- "We discovered [thing] and adjusted [aspect]. Here is why: [reasoning]."
- "We need [decision/input/approval] from [stakeholder]"

*Launch Preparation*:
- "We are 2 weeks from launch. Training is [when/how]."
- "Here is what is changing and how it affects you."
- "Support is available at [where/how]."

*Post-Launch*:
- "We successfully launched. Here is what we accomplished."
- "We are monitoring for issues. Report problems to [channel]."
- "Here is what is next based on your feedback."

**Section 4: Crisis/Risk Communication**

If something goes wrong (timeline slip, budget overrun, major issue):
- Who communicates? (Usually the PM or sponsor, depending on severity)
- When? (Immediately for critical issues, within 24 hours for major issues)
- What format? (Usually a direct communication to leadership, then cascading down)
- What to say? (Facts, what we know and do not know, what we are doing about it, timeline for update)

**Example of Sarah's Crisis Communication**:
*Situation*: The General Contractor discovers asbestos in the renovation space. Timeline will slip 4 weeks.

*Communication*:
- **To CFO (Sponsor)**: Phone call within 1 hour. "I am calling to tell you about an issue. During demolition, asbestos was discovered in the wall cavities. We are following all required remediation procedures. This will add 4 weeks to the project, moving completion to April 15. IT is already assessing the impact. We will have more details by tomorrow. I am escalating this because it affects the business case timeline."
- **To Steering Committee**: Email within 4 hours with summary, impact, and next steps.
- **To Project Team**: In-person meeting (or video if distributed). Explain situation, assure everyone safety is priority, outline revised timeline, answer questions.
- **To Facilities Staff**: Email explaining situation, reassuring about safety, explaining revised timeline.
- **To Employees**: Brief announcement about timeline change, no need to explain asbestos (would cause unnecessary alarm), just "construction discovered something that requires additional time."

## 7.5 Tailoring Communication by Project Type

Communication strategies differ based on the project methodology:

### 7.5.1 Predictive Projects

In predictive projects, communication emphasizes:
- **Upfront planning and clarity**: "Here is the complete scope, schedule, and budget. This is what we will deliver."
- **Change management**: "The scope is set. Changes require formal approval and may affect timeline/budget."
- **Milestone-based updates**: "We completed design phase. Moving to development phase."
- **Formal gates and approvals**: "Here is the design. Do you approve? Yes/No."

**Communication frequency**: Less frequent but more formal (monthly rather than weekly; formal documents rather than daily updates)

**Example - Sarah's Renovation**:
- Kickoff presentation: Detailed scope, timeline, budget
- Monthly steering committee: Status report (15 pages), Q&A
- Milestone reviews: "Design complete. Ready to move to construction? [formal approval]"
- Change control: Any scope changes go through formal change request process
- Final report: Lessons learned, final costs, what worked

### 7.5.2 Agile Projects

In agile projects, communication emphasizes:
- **Continuous feedback**: "Here is what we built. What do you think? We will adjust."
- **Iteration and learning**: "We learned X this sprint. We are adjusting direction."
- **Frequent delivery**: "We shipped this feature. Try it and give feedback."
- **Transparency about what we do not know**: "We are learning as we go. Some things will change."

**Communication frequency**: More frequent but often less formal (daily standups, weekly demos, async updates)

**Example - Sarah's Expense System**:
- Sprint kickoff: "This sprint we are focusing on [feature]. It will be ready for demo Friday."
- Daily standup: 15-minute sync on blockers and progress
- Sprint demo: "Here is what we built. Try it. What questions do you have?"
- Sprint retrospective: "Here is what worked, what did not. Here is what we are changing next sprint."
- Continuous feedback: "You said you did not like the button placement. We will adjust it next sprint."

### 7.5.3 Hybrid Projects

In hybrid projects, communication balances structure and flexibility:
- **Phased planning**: "Phase 1 is fixed. Phase 2 will be planned in 2 months based on phase 1 learning."
- **Regular checkpoints**: "Every month we check in. We will adjust if needed."
- **Managed iteration**: "Within this phase, we are flexible. We will try, learn, adjust."
- **Escalation paths**: "Small decisions are made by the team. Big decisions go to steering committee."

**Communication frequency**: Moderate (weekly team updates, monthly stakeholder updates)

**Example - Sarah's Transformation**:
- Program kickoff: "Phase 1 (3 months) is designing the new way of working. Phase 2 will pilot. Phase 3 will be full rollout. Each phase will inform the next."
- Weekly design team: Status, decisions, blockers (internal communication)
- Monthly steering committee: Progress, risks, decisions needed, preliminary learning (external communication)
- Monthly pilots: "Here is the current design. We are testing it with you. What is working? What needs to change?"
- Quarterly organization-wide: "Here is progress. Here is what we are learning. We will adjust."

## 7.6 The Communication Calendar

Sarah creates a **Communication Calendar**—a simple timeline of planned communications:

```
JANUARY
- Jan 3: Project kickoff meeting (all stakeholders)
- Jan 10: Weekly standup #1 (core team)
- Jan 17: Weekly standup #2; Monthly steering committee #1
- Jan 24: Weekly standup #3
- Jan 31: Weekly standup #4; Monthly steering committee #2

FEBRUARY
- Feb 7: Weekly standup #5; Sprint demo #1
- Feb 14: Weekly standup #6
- Feb 21: Weekly standup #7; Monthly steering committee #3
- Feb 28: Weekly standup #8; Sprint demo #2

MARCH
- Mar 7: Weekly standup #9
- Mar 14: Weekly standup #10; Monthly steering committee #4
- Mar 21: Weekly standup #11; Beta launch announcement
- Mar 28: Weekly standup #12; Sprint demo #3

APRIL
- Apr 7: User acceptance testing announcement
- Apr 14: Monthly steering committee #5; UAT results
- Apr 21: Launch readiness review
- Apr 28: Go-live day; Launch announcement; Kick-off support plan
```

This calendar ensures:
- Regular, predictable communication (people know when to expect updates)
- Alignment with project milestones (announcements happen at right time)
- No surprises (important communications are planned ahead)
- Consistent engagement (stakeholders remain informed throughout)

---

## 7.7 The Challenge of Too Much Communication

Sarah learns an important lesson: *More communication is not always better. There is a balance.*

**Too little communication**:
- Stakeholders feel left out
- Assumptions and rumors fill the gap
- Misalignment and surprises
- Loss of trust

**Too much communication**:
- Information overload
- People tune out
- Important information gets lost
- Stakeholder fatigue

**Finding the balance**:

1. **Right amount**: Each stakeholder gets what they need, no more, no less
   - CFO needs status and risks; does not need daily technical details
   - Developer needs daily progress; does not need monthly steering committee slides
   - Accounting team needs training and support; does not need design decisions

2. **Right frequency**: Based on project phase and stakeholder role
   - Kickoff phase: Frequent communication (alignment)
   - Execution phase: Regular communication (steady state)
   - Crisis: Increased communication (more frequent)
   - Wrap-up: Reflection and documentation

3. **Right channel**: Appropriate to the content and audience
   - Decisions go in documented email, not slack messages
   - Quick questions go in chat, not formal meetings
   - Important changes go in meetings, not buried in email

4. **Right depth**: Tailored to the audience
   - Executives: One-page summary with key metrics
   - Teams: Detailed status with technical info
   - Operators: Clear impact statements and procedures

**Sarah's rule of thumb**: "If I get a question I should have already answered in a previous communication, that is a signal my communication is not working."

---

## 7.8 Measuring Communication Effectiveness

Sarah learns to assess whether her communication strategy is working:

**Signals of effective communication**:
- Stakeholders ask informed questions (they understood the previous information)
- Few surprises (stakeholders already knew about upcoming announcements)
- Decisions made efficiently (stakeholders understood the information they needed to decide)
- Stakeholders trust the information (they believe you are being honest about progress and risks)
- Action items completed (stakeholders understood what they needed to do)

**Signals of ineffective communication**:
- Stakeholders ask basic questions already answered ("Wait, we are launching in April? I thought it was May")
- Regular surprises ("I did not know this was happening")
- Decision delays ("I need to understand more before I can decide")
- Skepticism or mistrust ("Is that really on track or are you just saying that?")
- Missed action items ("I did not know I was supposed to do that")

**Ways to check**:
- Ask stakeholders: "Is this communication working for you? Too frequent? Not enough detail? Different channel would work better?"
- Observe attendance and engagement: Do people attend and participate? Or do they send a delegate and multi-task?
- Track responsiveness: Do people respond to requests for input? Do they follow through on action items?
- Conduct pulse surveys: "How informed do you feel about the project? [1-5 scale]. What would improve that?"

## Key Takeaways: Communication Planning and Strategy

1. **Communication has a purpose**: Inform, get input, build alignment, manage expectations, celebrate
2. **Analyze information needs**: Different stakeholders need different information, at different frequencies, in different formats
3. **Choose channels strategically**: Synchronous (meetings) vs. asynchronous (email), based on purpose and audience
4. **Document the plan**: Make sure everyone knows what to expect and where to find information
5. **Tailor to project type**: Predictive, agile, and hybrid projects have different communication cadences
6. **Create a communication calendar**: Planned communications aligned with project phases
7. **Avoid information overload**: Balance frequency and depth for each stakeholder
8. **Measure effectiveness**: Adjust based on stakeholder feedback and behavior

## Practice Scenario

**Context**: You are starting a project to implement new HR software across your organization. You have stakeholders in:
- HR department (20 people) - High interest, medium power
- IT department (15 people) - High interest, high power
- 5 Department heads - Low interest, medium power
- 500 employees - Will be affected, low interest/power

**Design a Communication Plan**:
1. What are the information needs for each stakeholder group?
2. What channels would you use? Why?
3. How frequently would you communicate?
4. What are the key messages for each phase (kickoff, implementation, launch, post-launch)?
5. How would you know if your communication is working?
