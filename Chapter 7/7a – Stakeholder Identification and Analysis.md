# 7a – Stakeholder Identification and Analysis

Sarah sits down with her project notebook and asks a simple question: *Who cares about this project?*

It seems like it should be obvious. But as she starts listing names, she realizes it is harder than she thought. For the office renovation, is the security guard a stakeholder? They will work in the building, but do they have influence over decisions? What about the employee who requested the renovation in the first place—are they still interested now that the project is underway?

This section teaches you how to systematically identify and analyze stakeholders, moving beyond simply listing names to understanding their position, influence, and how they might impact—or be impacted by—your project.

## 7.1 What Is a Stakeholder?

A stakeholder is anyone who is affected by or can affect the project. This includes:
- People who benefit from the project's outcome (end users, customers, beneficiaries)
- People responsible for delivering the project (team members, vendors, partners)
- People with authority to make decisions about the project (sponsors, steering committees, executives)
- People with formal governance over the project (compliance, legal, audit)
- People affected by side effects of the project (facilities staff during renovation, employees during system migration, other departments affected by process change)

**Key insight**: Stakeholders are not just the people who want you to succeed. They include people who might lose something if you succeed (people whose job becomes obsolete, people who benefit from the current way of working, competitors).

**Example from Sarah's projects:**

*Office Renovation*:
- **Clear stakeholders**: CFO (sponsor), Facilities Manager (core team), General Contractor (vendor)
- **Affected stakeholders**: Employees moving to the new space, finance team managing the budget
- **Potential resisters**: Facilities staff currently managing the old space, employees comfortable with current layout
- **Hidden stakeholders**: Regional office directors (who might later want similar renovations), IT (who might need to plan for technology in new space)

*Expense System*:
- **Clear stakeholders**: CFO (product owner), Finance team (end users), Developers (delivery team)
- **Affected stakeholders**: Department managers who will use the system, Accounting team who will process reports, IT who will support it
- **Potential resisters**: People who benefit from current process (workarounds that make them look good), Accounting processors who fear job loss
- **Hidden stakeholders**: Auditors (interested in compliance), Procurement team (if expense tracking affects vendor management)

*Transformation Program*:
- **Clear stakeholders**: Steering Committee (governance), Design Team (delivery), Pilot teams (early adopters)
- **Affected stakeholders**: All employees who will eventually use new practices, Regional offices, Department heads
- **Potential resisters**: People skilled at current practices, supervisors who gained power through current structure
- **Hidden stakeholders**: HR (benefits of new practice for hiring), Legal (compliance implications), Customers (impact of changed processes)

## 7.2 Dimensions for Analyzing Stakeholders

Simply listing stakeholders is not enough. You need to understand them on multiple dimensions so you can prioritize your engagement efforts.

### 7.2.1 Power and Interest Matrix

The most common framework for prioritizing stakeholders is the Power/Interest Matrix. It places stakeholders on two axes:

**Power**: The degree to which the stakeholder can influence or control the project
- High power: Can make decisions, allocate resources, approve scope, require changes
- Low power: Can request things but cannot enforce them

**Interest**: The degree to which the stakeholder is affected by or cares about the project
- High interest: The outcome matters to them; they pay attention
- Low interest: It does not matter much to them; they have other priorities

This creates four quadrants:

**1. Manage Closely (High Power, High Interest)**
- These are your key stakeholders
- They care about the project AND can influence it
- They demand regular, detailed communication
- Involve them in decisions
- Address their concerns immediately
- Examples: Executive sponsor, steering committee members, key decision-makers

**Sarah's example (Expense System)**:
- CFO is high power (controls budget, business strategy) and high interest (benefits from efficiency gain)
- Finance Manager is high power (can set requirements) and high interest (will use the system daily)

**2. Keep Satisfied (High Power, Low Interest)**
- They can influence the project but may not care much about it
- Easy to alienate if you ignore them
- Don't burden with details; keep them informed at high level
- Escalate to them when needed (when only they can help)
- Engage them when you need their power
- Examples: Executive who doesn't use the system but controls budget, board member, senior manager overseeing portfolio

**Sarah's example (Office Renovation)**:
- CFO (sponsor) is here—high power (controls project), lower interest than Facilities Manager (who cares about day-to-day impact)

**3. Keep Informed (Low Power, High Interest)**
- They care about the project but cannot directly influence decisions
- They want to know what is happening and feel heard
- Regular updates make them feel included
- Address their concerns; explain decisions
- Do not expect them to help make final decisions, but do get their input
- Examples: End users, support staff affected by change, employees in pilot teams

**Sarah's example (Transformation)**:
- Front-line employees in pilot teams (high interest—they will have to change their work) but low power (decisions made by steering committee)
- Facilities staff (high interest—renovation affects them daily) but low power (CFO and contractor make decisions)

**4. Monitor (Low Power, Low Interest)**
- They might be affected but do not care much
- Minimal communication; just keep them in the loop
- They might become more interested later
- Do not over-communicate; it wastes time and creates noise
- Examples: Departments not directly affected, occasional stakeholders, people on distribution lists

**Sarah's example (Office Renovation)**:
- Security team (will work in renovated space but not central to decisions)
- Employees in other locations not affected by the renovation
- Support staff not involved in day-to-day operations

### 7.2.2 Using the Matrix in Practice

When Sarah applies this to her office renovation, her stakeholder map looks like this:

| Stakeholder | Power | Interest | Quadrant | Action |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| CFO (Sponsor) | High | Medium | Keep Satisfied | Weekly update, escalate decisions that need approval |
| Facilities Manager | Medium | High | Keep Informed | Bi-weekly working sessions, involve in decisions |
| General Contractor | High | High | Manage Closely | Weekly meetings, collaborative planning |
| Finance (Budget oversight) | Medium | Low | Keep Satisfied | Monthly budget review |
| Facilities Staff | Low | High | Keep Informed | Monthly town halls, feedback sessions |
| Employees (future occupants) | Low | Medium | Monitor | Quarterly updates, announcement of completion |
| Regional Directors | Medium | Low | Monitor/Escalate if needed | Inform of decisions affecting their offices |
| IT (Technology in space) | Medium | Low | Keep Satisfied | Involve in planning for tech infrastructure |

This matrix is not static. As the project progresses, stakeholders move:
- As the renovation gets closer, employees move from Low Interest to High Interest
- If the project faces challenges, finance team might move to High Power, High Interest
- If regional directors need similar work, they might move to High Power, High Interest

**Critical insight**: The Power/Interest Matrix should be updated regularly. Every month or quarter, Sarah revisits her stakeholder map to see if positions have shifted.

## 7.3 Additional Dimensions for Deeper Understanding

Beyond power and interest, deeper analysis considers:

### 7.3.1 Salience: Power, Legitimacy, and Urgency

Some frameworks add three dimensions (Salience model):

**Power**: Can the stakeholder enforce their will?
**Legitimacy**: Do they have a right to be involved? (e.g., legally, ethically, contractually)
**Urgency**: Do they need immediate attention?

A stakeholder who has all three (power + legitimacy + urgency) requires immediate, intensive engagement. Someone with only one might need less attention.

**Example**:
- **Regulatory auditor**: Low power (cannot make project decisions) but high legitimacy (required by law) and potentially high urgency (audit deadline approaching). Action: Coordinate with them early to ensure compliance.
- **Employee worried about job loss**: Low power, high legitimacy (they work here), potentially high urgency (anxious now). Action: Communicate, listen, reassure.

### 7.3.2 Attitude and Sentiment

Understanding how stakeholders *feel* about the project is as important as understanding their power.

**Supporter**: Actively wants the project to succeed; will help remove obstacles
- Action: Involve them, give them visibility, recognize their support

**Neutral**: Does not care one way or another; just wants to do their job
- Action: Keep them informed; they are not a risk unless change affects them

**Skeptical**: Doubts the project will work or is worth the effort; may resist but not openly
- Action: Address their concerns, show evidence, build credibility

**Resistant**: Actively opposes the project; fears negative consequences; will work against it
- Action: Listen to their concerns, involve them early, address root cause of resistance

**Hostile**: Actively works against the project; wants it to fail
- Action: Escalate to leadership; may need to manage this person differently

**Sarah's example**:
In the transformation program, Sarah discovers that one regional director is skeptical. He manages a smaller office and worries the new practices won't scale down. Rather than dismiss him, Sarah involves him in the design process, creates a scaled version for small offices, and gets his endorsement. By month three, he becomes a supporter and champions the program in his region.

Sarah learns: *Skeptical is not the same as hostile. A skeptical stakeholder who sees their concerns addressed often becomes the most credible advocate.*

## 7.4 Mapping Stakeholder Relationships and Influence

Stakeholders do not exist in isolation. They influence each other:

- Decisions by one stakeholder affect another (CFO's budget allocation affects what the contractor can do)
- Stakeholders form coalitions (three regional directors asking similar questions become a more powerful block)
- Stakeholders have hierarchical relationships (managers influence their direct reports)
- Stakeholders have informal influence networks (the respected senior technician influences how the team thinks)

Understanding these relationships helps you:
1. Identify who influences whom (often informal power is more important than formal authority)
2. Predict how information will spread (if you tell person A, who will person A tell?)
3. Find allies (who can help you influence a resistant stakeholder?)
4. Anticipate coalition-building (will certain stakeholders band together?)

**Example from Sarah's Transformation Program**:

Sarah creates a simple influence map:

```
Steering Committee (5 executives)
    ↑ (listen to)
Finance Director ← (influences) → IT Director ← (influences) → HR Director
    ↑                                                               ↑
    |                                                               |
 Finance Team                                                   HR Team
    ↑                                                               ↑
    └─── Design Team (8 people) ───┘
         (Sarah leads)
         ↑
         └─── Pilot Teams (3 teams) ← (influenced by) ← Regional Directors
```

This map reveals:
- The Finance Director has significant influence over the Steering Committee (CFO listens to them)
- Regional Directors have influence over pilot teams (who report to them or work in their region)
- Design Team is the hub—connected to multiple groups

Armed with this insight, Sarah prioritizes her engagement:
1. Get Finance Director's buy-in early (he influences CFO)
2. Involve regional directors early in pilot planning (so they feel ownership)
3. Keep design team communications flowing so they can answer questions from their networks

## 7.5 Identifying Unknown and Hidden Stakeholders

One of Sarah's biggest challenges is discovering stakeholders she did not know existed.

**Unknown stakeholders** are people who are affected by the project but not yet identified. They often emerge when:
- The project scope expands (a renovation uncovers electrical issues affecting other departments)
- Unexpected people show interest (a department manager asks if they can join the pilot)
- Side effects become visible (the new expense system affects the auditing process)

**Hidden stakeholders** are people who deliberately stay under the radar:
- People who benefit from current problems (a workaround that makes someone look productive)
- People who fear change (job loss, reduced influence, disrupted routine)
- People in competitor roles (another department doing similar work who might be consolidate)

**Discovery techniques**:

1. **Ask "Who else cares?"** When someone shows interest, ask them: "Who else in your network will be affected by this decision?"

2. **Follow the money**: Who is affected by budget decisions? Who benefits if costs decrease? Who loses if efficiency increases?

3. **Follow the process**: Who currently does this work? Who will do it differently? Who audits or oversees it?

4. **Follow the change**: Who will have to change how they work? Who teaches them? Who audits compliance?

5. **Invite input**: Post a stakeholder map in a team meeting and ask, "Who did we miss?"

**Sarah's discovery moment**:
For the expense system, Sarah initially missed the Accounting processors. But when she asked finance team, "Who processes these reports?", the Finance Manager said, "The Accounting team—there are 8 of them." Sarah had been focused on Finance's need for better data, but the processors' concern—fear of job loss as the system automates approval workflows—was equally important. By engaging them early and showing that the system would *reduce tedious manual work* rather than eliminate jobs, she turned them from hidden resisters into supporters.

## 7.6 Creating a Stakeholder Register

Once Sarah has identified and analyzed her stakeholders, she documents them in a **Stakeholder Register**—a simple table that tracks:

**Columns**:
1. Stakeholder Name/Role
2. Organization/Department
3. Power (High/Medium/Low)
4. Interest (High/Medium/Low)
5. Attitude (Supporter/Neutral/Skeptical/Resistant/Hostile)
6. Key Concern or Motivation
7. Engagement Strategy
8. Primary Communication Channel
9. Last Engagement Date
10. Notes

**Example - Sarah's Expense System Stakeholder Register**:

| Stakeholder | Org | Power | Interest | Attitude | Key Concern | Engagement | Channel | Last Date | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CFO (PO) | Finance | High | High | Supporter | Cost reduction, control | Weekly standup, bi-weekly demos | Meeting | 12/4 | Reviews all major decisions |
| Finance Manager (BA) | Finance | Medium | High | Supporter | Usability, end-user adoption | Daily standup, user testing | Meeting + Email | 12/5 | Key bridge to Finance team |
| Accounting Manager | Finance | Medium | Medium | Skeptical | Job security, workload change | Monthly working session | Meeting | 12/1 | Worried about automation; show impact |
| IT Director | IT | High | Low | Neutral | System reliability, support load | Monthly architecture review | Meeting | 12/3 | Keep informed of deployments |
| Department Managers (5) | Various | Medium | Low | Neutral | Policy impact on their teams | Quarterly updates | Email + Portal | 11/28 | Monitor sentiment |

This register becomes a working document. Sarah updates it:
- When stakeholder attitude changes (Accounting Manager moved from Resistant to Skeptical after meeting)
- When new stakeholders emerge (Regional Directors inquiring about feature)
- When engagement strategy needs adjustment (IT Director needs monthly reviews not quarterly)

## 7.7 Segmenting Stakeholders for Different Engagement Approaches

Once Sarah has 20+ stakeholders, she realizes she cannot use a one-size-fits-all communication approach. Instead, she segments them:

**By Power/Interest Level**:
- Manage Closely: Detailed updates, involvement in decisions, escalation pathway
- Keep Satisfied: High-level updates, escalation when needed
- Keep Informed: Regular updates, opportunity to ask questions
- Monitor: Occasional communications, monitor for change in interest

**By Attitude**:
- Supporters: Visibility, recognition, opportunities to help
- Neutral: Information and data
- Skeptical: Evidence, involvement, addressing concerns
- Resistant: Listen, understand root cause, involvement in solutions

**By Stakeholder Type**:
- **Executive/Decision-makers**: High-level summaries, trends, decisions needed, risks
- **Team members/operators**: Detailed technical info, how it affects their work, opportunities for input
- **End users**: Benefits, training, support, feedback mechanisms
- **Vendors/partners**: Scope of work, quality expectations, constraints, escalation paths

---

## 7.8 Ethical Considerations in Stakeholder Analysis

As Sarah reflects on stakeholder analysis, she realizes it raises ethical questions:

**Question 1: Is it manipulative to analyze stakeholders' power and influence?**

No, if done openly. Stakeholder analysis is about *understanding* influence so you can *engage appropriately*. If you deliberately hide a project from a high-power stakeholder, that is manipulative. If you analyze power so you can better communicate with that person, that is professional management.

**Question 2: What if a stakeholder's concern is based on fear or misinformation?**

Listen first. Sometimes fear is rational (someone will lose a job). Sometimes it is based on misunderstanding. Either way, the concern is real to them. Address it respectfully. Share information. Involve them in decisions when possible.

**Question 3: What about hidden stakeholders who do not want to be identified?**

Respect privacy and professional boundaries. But do not hide information that affects them. If your change will impact a department, someone in that department should know and have a chance to be involved.

## Key Takeaways: Stakeholder Identification and Analysis

1. **Identify all categories**: Decision-makers, team members, end users, affected people, resisters, hidden stakeholders
2. **Use the Power/Interest Matrix** as a primary tool for prioritization
3. **Understand attitude**: Support, neutrality, skepticism, resistance, hostility are not fixed; they can change
4. **Map relationships**: Understand who influences whom so you can predict how information flows
5. **Discover hidden stakeholders**: Ask questions, follow processes and money, invite input
6. **Create a Stakeholder Register**: Document analysis so you can track changes and engagement
7. **Segment engagement**: Different stakeholders need different communication approaches
8. **Remember the ethical dimension**: Stakeholder analysis is about better engagement, not manipulation

**Sarah's Insight**:
> "I used to think stakeholders were just people I had to 'manage.' But now I see them as people with legitimate interests in the project. Some will benefit, some will be burdened, some will have to change. My job is not to manipulate them into agreement. My job is to understand them, communicate honestly, and involve them in shaping solutions. That is when stakeholders become allies instead of obstacles."

## Practice Scenario

**Context**: You are managing a digital transformation project for an insurance company. The project will move claim processing from a manual system to an AI-assisted system. You have been asked to identify and analyze stakeholders.

**Who should you talk to?** What questions should you ask to discover stakeholders and understand their positions?

**What would you include in your Stakeholder Register?** Create a brief table with at least 8 stakeholders.

**Think about this**: What hidden stakeholders might emerge 3 months into the project? What would prompt you to update your stakeholder map?
