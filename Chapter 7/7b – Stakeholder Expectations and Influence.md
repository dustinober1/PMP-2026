# 7b – Stakeholder Expectations and Influence

Sarah has identified her stakeholders and created a register. But she discovers something important: *knowing who stakeholders are is not the same as understanding what they actually expect.*

Last week, the CFO assumed the renovation would be finished by March 15 for a client visit. The General Contractor had assumed April 15 based on the original contract. The Facilities Manager was planning training for the new space in May. None of these dates were formally documented, but each stakeholder *believed* their date was what had been agreed.

With the expense system team, Sarah found that the Finance Manager expected a fully integrated expense system connected to the general ledger. The CFO wanted a simple, fast replacement for the current system with minimal integration. IT expected they would have six months to build infrastructure. The developers estimated three months if given the right resources.

This section is about understanding stakeholder expectations, uncovering competing interests, and navigating the reality that *not all stakeholders can be satisfied*.

## 7.1 What Do Stakeholders Expect?

Expectations cover multiple dimensions:

### 7.1.1 Project Outcomes and Deliverables

**What will the project produce?**
- The tangible outputs (renovated space, new software, new process)
- Features and functionality
- Quality level (nice-to-have or mission-critical)
- Timing and phasing (all at once or in phases)

**Sarah's example**:
- **Renovation**: CFO expects "move-in ready"—fully finished, furnished, tested. General Contractor expects "shell complete"—building done but clients furnish their own spaces. Who is right? The contract determines the answer. Sarah's job is to make sure everyone *agrees* on the answer before work starts.

### 7.1.2 Timeline and Speed

Different stakeholders care about different timing:
- **Business stakeholders** often want fast delivery (ROI, competitive advantage, solve a problem quickly)
- **Operations stakeholders** care about stability, may prefer slower, more tested delivery
- **End users** care about training time and transition support
- **Finance** cares about when costs hit the budget (front-loaded or spread over time)

**Competing expectations**:
- CFO wants the expense system in 3 months to impact the current fiscal year
- IT wants 6 months to build proper infrastructure
- QA wants 2 months just for testing
- Who decides? This is where stakeholder engagement becomes critical.

### 7.1.3 Involvement and Voice

Some stakeholders expect to be involved in decisions. Others expect to be told what to do:
- **Co-creators**: Want deep involvement, influence on design
- **Collaborators**: Want to be asked for input and have it considered
- **Informed**: Want to know what is happening and understand the reasoning
- **Notified**: Just want a heads-up before something changes
- **Unaware**: Have no expectation; will be surprised when it happens

**Critical insight**: Stakeholders often have different expectations about their level of involvement. A stakeholder expecting co-creator treatment but being given "informed" status will feel excluded.

### 7.1.4 Risk and Consequences

Stakeholders have different stakes in the project:
- **Opportunity**: What do they gain if the project succeeds? (efficiency, competitive advantage, career advancement)
- **Risk**: What do they lose if the project fails? (credibility, budget, job)
- **Change burden**: How much disruption will this create? (learning new system, behavior change, resource commitment)

**Example**:
- **CFO**: Gain = company saves $50K/year on expense processing; Risk = public failure affecting her credibility; Change burden = low (does not use system daily)
- **Expense processors**: Gain = less tedious work; Risk = job loss if automated; Change burden = high (completely new workflow)
- **IT**: Gain = reduced support load; Risk = integration problems; Change burden = medium (new system to support)

Stakeholders with high risk and high change burden are more likely to resist.

## 7.2 Uncovering Hidden Expectations

Sarah learns that *stated expectations* (what people say they want) often differ from *real expectations* (what they actually care about). Hidden expectations often emerge from:

### 7.2.1 Fear and Personal Consequences

People worry about things they often do not say openly:
- Fear of job loss or role diminishment
- Fear of looking incompetent (having to learn something new)
- Fear of losing influence or authority
- Fear of increased workload or responsibility
- Fear that their expertise will become irrelevant

**Sarah's example (Expense System)**:
One Accounting processor was labeled "resistant" in the stakeholder analysis. In conversation, Sarah assumed it was about job security. But when she asked directly, "What concerns you most about the new system?", the processor said: "I am 58 years old. I have done this job for 15 years the same way. Learning new software is intimidating. What if I cannot keep up?"

The real concern was not "I will lose my job" but "I will look stupid." Sarah's response: involve the processor in testing, provide early training, set up a mentor relationship with a younger team member who is excited about the new system. Within a month, the processor went from skeptical to championing the system.

### 7.2.2 Unspoken Agendas

Stakeholders often have personal or departmental agendas:
- **Career advancement**: "If I deliver this project on time, I will be promoted"
- **Budget protection**: "If I can stretch this project longer, my team stays fully staffed"
- **Territory protection**: "If this system works, my department's role might be consolidated with another"
- **Political positioning**: "I need to be seen as the voice of our region"
- **Personal priorities**: "I care about this feature because it solves my biggest pain point"

These are not necessarily bad. But they influence how a stakeholder responds to decisions.

**Sarah's example (Transformation)**:
One regional director enthusiastically supported the transformation program. Sarah assumed it was because he believed in the vision. But over time, she realized he saw it as an opportunity: "If I champion this and it succeeds, the executives will see me as an innovator. That helps my case for the VP role."

Was the regional director being dishonest? No. He believed in the program *and* he saw a personal benefit. His enthusiasm was real. But understanding his agenda helped Sarah work with him effectively—she gave him opportunities to present to the steering committee, recognized his contribution, and created visible success metrics he could claim credit for.

### 7.2.3 Organizational and Cultural Factors

Hidden expectations emerge from organizational context:
- **"That is how we do things here"**: Unspoken norms about decision-making, risk tolerance, change pace
- **Power dynamics**: Who actually makes decisions (formal authority vs. real influence)
- **Trust history**: Have past projects delivered? Do people believe promises?
- **Organizational politics**: Conflicts between departments, silos, historical tensions

**Sarah's example**:
In her company, Finance and Operations have a history of conflict. Finance pushes for cost reduction; Operations pushes for reliability. In the expense system project, the CFO wanted to minimize the IT infrastructure investment (cost), and the IT Director wanted to build with redundancy and scalability (reliability). Sarah had to understand this historical tension to help them find a middle ground.

## 7.3 How to Uncover Expectations

Sarah learns several techniques for discovering what stakeholders really expect:

### 7.3.1 One-on-One Conversations

The most direct approach is to ask.

**Questions that uncover expectations**:
1. "What does success look like for you on this project?"
2. "What concerns you most about this project?"
3. "How will this project affect your work / your team / your responsibilities?"
4. "What would surprise or upset you if it happened differently than you expected?"
5. "If this project fails, what is at stake for you?"
6. "Who in your network needs to know about this project? What do they care about?"
7. "What have we not talked about that matters to you?"

The last question is particularly powerful. It opens space for people to raise concerns or expectations they think are obvious but may not have been mentioned.

**Sarah's approach**:
With each key stakeholder, Sarah blocks 30-60 minutes for a one-on-one conversation. She goes in with no agenda except to listen. She asks questions, takes notes, and then thanks them for their time. The conversation is not about selling the project—it is about understanding the stakeholder.

### 7.3.2 Observation and Pattern Recognition

What people *do* reveals their real expectations sometimes more than what they *say*.

**Patterns to notice**:
- Who attends every meeting? Who sends a delegate? Who does not show up?
- Who speaks up and who stays quiet? Whose questions are dismissed?
- Who seems anxious, skeptical, or enthusiastic?
- Whose work seems affected? Who is working extra hours?

**Sarah's example (Transformation)**:
Sarah notices that one design team member is quiet in meetings but sends detailed emails afterward. She realizes this person prefers asynchronous communication. When she starts sharing design options via email and giving 48 hours for feedback before discussing in meetings, this person becomes a major contributor—not because expectations changed, but because the *communication style* matched their preference.

### 7.3.3 Document Review and Analysis

Formal documents often reveal expectations:
- **Project charter**: What does it say about scope, timeline, success criteria?
- **Contracts**: What does the vendor expect to deliver?
- **Email trails**: What commitments were made? What assumptions underlie them?
- **Meeting notes**: What was decided? What was left ambiguous?
- **Budgets**: How much investment is committed? What does that reveal about priority?

Sarah learns to look not just for what is *written* but what is *missing* or *ambiguous*. When the project charter says "Q1 delivery" but does not specify "March 31 by 5 PM," there is room for different expectations.

## 7.4 Managing Competing Expectations

Sarah's biggest realization is this: *You cannot satisfy all stakeholder expectations if they conflict. Your job is to help them agree on trade-offs.*

### 7.4.1 The Reality of Trade-offs

In project management, the fundamental constraint is the "Iron Triangle":
- **Scope**: What you are building
- **Timeline**: When you deliver
- **Resources** (or Cost): What you spend

You cannot maximize all three. Every stakeholder wants something different:
- **Finance**: "Keep costs down"
- **Business**: "Deliver by March"
- **Operations**: "Make it perfect; do not rush"
- **End users**: "Include all these features"

Sarah learns to reframe these conversations: *The question is not "Can we do everything?" The question is "Given constraints, what are we optimizing for?"*

### 7.4.2 Surfacing Assumptions and Constraints

Before you can manage trade-offs, everyone needs to understand the constraints:

**Financial constraints**:
- "We have $250K in the budget. That is what we have."
- "If we want more features, we either spend more or extend the timeline."

**Timeline constraints**:
- "The business opportunity exists until December 31. After that, the market shifts."
- "If we slip to Q2, we miss the strategic deadline."

**Resource constraints**:
- "We have 5 developers available. They are not available after June."
- "The senior architect can only dedicate 20% of their time."

When constraints are clear, stakeholders usually accept them. When constraints are hidden or ambiguous, stakeholders assume they can have everything.

**Sarah's example (Renovation)**:
Early in the project, there was confusion about timeline. Sarah called a meeting and laid out the timeline constraint: "The board approved a $500K budget and a March 15 completion date. The General Contractor needs to break ground by January 2 to finish by March 15. That is not flexible. If we want more features, we either increase budget, extend timeline, or reduce scope. What are we optimizing for?"

With that clarity, stakeholders stopped assuming they could have it all. They focused on what mattered most.

### 7.4.3 Making Explicit Trade-off Decisions

Sarah uses a structured approach when stakeholders have conflicting expectations:

**Step 1: Surface the conflict**
- "I am hearing two different expectations. Finance wants to keep costs down, and Operations wants to build with redundancy, which costs more. Is that right?"
- Make sure everyone agrees on what the conflict is.

**Step 2: Understand the reasoning**
- "Finance, tell us why cost control is critical."
- "Operations, tell us why redundancy matters."
- Listen for the underlying concern (fear of failure, competitive pressure, technical risk).

**Step 3: Explore trade-offs**
- "If we go with Operations' approach, costs increase by 30%. But reliability increases. What is the business value of that extra reliability?"
- "If we go with Finance's approach, we save 30%. What risks does that create, and can we accept those risks?"

**Step 4: Make a decision**
- Usually, the decision-maker (sponsor) chooses the trade-off.
- But they should choose based on clear information about what they are gaining and losing.
- Document the decision: "We are prioritizing cost over redundancy because [reason]. We accept the risk of [specific risk]. Here is how we will mitigate that risk: [actions]."

**Sarah's decision on the Expense System**:
- **Conflict**: Finance Manager wants full integration (complex, expensive). CFO wants fast delivery (simpler, cheaper).
- **Sarah's decision**: "We will deliver a simple system in 3 months (CFO priority). We will build a phased integration plan in months 4-6 (Finance Manager's need addressed, but not in the first release)."
- **Result**: Both stakeholders feel heard. Scope is clear. Timeline is met. Integration happens later.

## 7.5 How Expectations Differ Across Ways of Working

Stakeholder expectations are deeply influenced by how the project is being managed.

### 7.5.1 Predictive (Waterfall) Expectations

In predictive projects, stakeholders expect:
- **Fixed scope**: "We will decide what to build upfront and then build it"
- **Single delivery date**: "We will deliver everything on March 15"
- **Limited changes**: "Changes disrupt the plan; we avoid them"
- **Formal approvals**: "The scope is reviewed and approved before work starts"
- **Minimal surprises**: "We plan thoroughly so there are no surprises"

**Sarah's renovation example**:
Stakeholders expect to see detailed plans before construction starts. They expect the building is completed as promised. They do not expect the scope to expand mid-project. If it does, they expect change orders and cost increases.

**Challenge**: Predictive projects lock in assumptions early. If assumptions change or new information emerges, stakeholders may resist changes.

### 7.5.2 Agile Expectations

In agile projects, stakeholders expect:
- **Evolving scope**: "We will discover what to build as we go"
- **Frequent delivery**: "We will deliver working features every 2-4 weeks (each sprint)"
- **Change is normal**: "The world changes; we adapt"
- **Regular feedback loops**: "You will see working software and can adjust direction"
- **Surprises are expected**: "We do not know everything upfront; we will learn together"

**Sarah's expense system example**:
Stakeholders see a working system after 2 weeks. In week 4, the CFO says, "I do not like how you are displaying the expense categories. Can we change it?" In predictive, this would be a change order. In agile, it is a normal adjustment. The team adjusts and shows the new version in 2 weeks.

**Challenge**: Agile projects require stakeholders to stay engaged and make frequent decisions. If a stakeholder says, "Just build it and show me when it is done," agile breaks down because feedback is essential.

### 7.5.3 Hybrid Expectations

In hybrid projects, stakeholders expect:
- **Some structure, some flexibility**: "We will fix the critical requirements but be flexible on nice-to-haves"
- **Phased delivery**: "Critical features in phase 1 (May), nice-to-haves in phase 2 (August)"
- **Managed change**: "We have a change process; not all changes get approved, but some will be"
- **Periodic (not continuous) feedback**: "We check in monthly; that is enough"

**Sarah's transformation example**:
The steering committee expects the program to deliver a core new process (fixed scope) but be flexible about regional adaptations (variable scope). They expect pilots to test and feed back (engagement), but not daily involvement (too much overhead).

---

## 7.6 Setting and Managing Expectations Over Time

A critical insight Sarah learns: *Setting expectations once is not enough. Expectations drift over time.*

### 7.6.1 The Expectation Drift

As a project progresses:
- Early priorities may shift (business context changes)
- Assumptions may prove wrong (technical challenges discovered)
- Stakeholder understanding evolves (they see working features and change their mind)
- New people join and bring different expectations

**Example**:
Month 1 of renovation: CFO expects move-in by March 15.
Month 2: Asbestos is discovered. Timeline slips to April 15. CFO's expectations change.
Month 3: Project is on track for April 15. CFO starts asking, "Can we do the second floor in this phase?" (scope creep).
Month 4: Facilities Manager is transferred. New person has not lived through the original discussions; they assume things can still change.

### 7.6.2 Periodic Reset Conversations

Sarah institutionalizes "expectation reset" conversations:

**Every sprint or iteration** (agile):
- "Here is what we delivered. Here is what we learned. Here is what we are discovering about the next phase. Does this match your expectations?"

**Every major milestone** (predictive):
- "We completed the design phase. Everyone still aligned on scope, timeline, and approach?"

**Every quarter** (hybrid/program):
- "We are at the end of Q3. Let's review: Are you getting what you expected from this program? Has anything changed about your priorities or concerns?"

These conversations are not to ask permission—it is to *verify alignment*. Often, a stakeholder's expectation has shifted and they have not mentioned it.

## 7.7 Navigating Difficult Stakeholder Situations

Sarah encounters several challenging stakeholder situations and learns how to handle them:

### 7.7.1 The Stakeholder Who Always Wants More

**Situation**: A stakeholder keeps asking for additional features, expanded scope, faster delivery, or more resources.

**Root causes**:
- Their original expectations were not clear (so they keep adding)
- They see the project working and keep thinking of new uses
- They are trying to build influence or political capital by showing ambition
- They genuinely do not understand the constraints

**Sarah's approach**:
1. Listen and acknowledge: "I hear that you want X. That would be valuable. Let me understand the impact."
2. Clarify the constraint: "Right now, we are scoped for Y and have Z resources. To add X, one of three things happens: we increase budget, extend timeline, or reduce other scope. Which would you like?"
3. Escalate if needed: "This is a decision for the sponsor because it affects the overall project. Let me bring this to the steering committee."
4. Document and follow up: "We documented your request. Here is when we will decide on it."

**Key insight**: Often, when stakeholders understand that more means trade-offs, they become more thoughtful. They prioritize better.

### 7.7.2 The Absent Stakeholder

**Situation**: A key stakeholder does not engage. They are not in meetings, do not provide input, do not seem to care.

**Root causes**:
- They are truly low-interest (it is not a priority for them)
- They do not understand their role or why their input matters
- They are too busy
- They do not trust the project will work (so why invest time?)
- They are observing from the sidelines before committing

**Sarah's approach**:
1. Clarify their role: "Your perspective on [topic] is critical because [reason]. Here is how we need your input: [specific asks]."
2. Make it easy: If the stakeholder is busy, do not ask them to sit in long meetings. Instead: "Send me your input via email by Friday; I will present your view in the meeting."
3. Get them early wins: Show working features or progress that demonstrates the project is viable.
4. Do not wait for them: Do not let one absent stakeholder hold up decisions. But make sure they understand what happened when they rejoin.

### 7.7.3 The Surprised Stakeholder

**Situation**: A stakeholder learns about a decision or change and says, "Wait, I did not know about this. I would have disagreed!"

**Root causes**:
- Hidden stakeholder you did not identify
- Assumption that someone else was communicating (but they were not)
- Stakeholder was informed but did not engage, now they are paying attention
- Change happened at a different organizational level and did not cascade down

**Sarah's response**:
1. Apologize: "I should have made sure you knew about this. I am sorry for the oversight."
2. Understand their concern: "What is your issue with this decision? What would you have wanted to happen differently?"
3. Assess if the decision can be revisited: Sometimes yes, sometimes no. Be honest.
4. Include them going forward: "I am putting you on the stakeholder list. You will get updates before decisions like this are made."
5. Document: Update the Stakeholder Register and communication plan.

### 7.7.4 The Stakeholder Conflict

**Situation**: Two or more stakeholders want fundamentally different things and cannot agree.

**Example**:
- CFO wants fast delivery (agile, small team, quick wins)
- IT wants proper planning (predictive, all requirements upfront, proper testing)
- They both have valid points but are on opposite sides

**Sarah's approach**:
1. Help them understand each other: "Let me make sure I understand your concerns. CFO, you are worried about [risk]. IT, you are worried about [risk]. Is that right?"
2. Find common ground: "It sounds like you both want a system that works well and launches successfully. You just disagree on the path. That is a legit disagreement that needs to be decided."
3. Escalate to decision-maker: "This is a decision about approach that goes above my pay grade. I am bringing this to the Sponsor/Steering Committee with both perspectives clearly explained."
4. Execute the decision: Once a decision is made, help both parties understand how it addresses their concerns: "The sponsor decided on a hybrid approach: we will do 2 weeks of requirements planning upfront, then iterate. That gives IT some of the structure you wanted and gives Finance some of the speed you wanted."

**Key insight**: Sometimes stakeholders are in genuine conflict and need a higher authority to decide. Your job is not to resolve the conflict through negotiation—it is to *escalate clearly* so the decision-maker can choose wisely.

## 7.8 Stakeholder Influence and Power Dynamics

Understanding stakeholder expectations also means understanding how stakeholders influence each other.

### 7.8.1 Informal vs. Formal Power

Often, formal authority (your job title, your role) matters less than informal influence:
- **Formal power**: CFO controls the budget. They decide which projects get funded.
- **Informal power**: A respected senior technician who everyone trusts influences which tool the team uses. They do not decide, but their opinion shapes the decision.

**Sarah's example**:
In the transformation program, one regional director has no formal authority on the Steering Committee. But he has managed his region successfully, is trusted by his peers, and when he speaks, people listen. When he endorses the transformation, it helps. When he was skeptical, it created doubt. His informal power is real.

### 7.8.2 Coalition Building and Alignment

Stakeholders often form coalitions:
- Several department heads who share a concern
- A group of end users worried about the change
- A group of executives aligned on a strategic priority

**How to work with coalitions**:
1. **Identify them**: Who naturally aligns with whom? Who do they talk to?
2. **Understand their shared concern**: What is the common thread?
3. **Engage the coalition leader**: The person who speaks first or whose opinion others defer to
4. **Make space for the group voice**: "I hear that several regions have a shared concern about scalability. Let's address that together."
5. **Do not ignore or dismiss**: "I understand this is important to multiple people. Let me explain my thinking and understand your perspective."

---

## Key Takeaways: Stakeholder Expectations and Influence

1. **Expectations are multi-dimensional**: Outcomes, timeline, involvement, risk, consequences
2. **Hidden expectations matter as much as stated ones**: Listen for fears, agendas, organizational factors
3. **Uncover expectations through conversation**: Direct questions are most effective
4. **Trade-offs are inevitable**: Be clear about constraints and let stakeholders choose what to prioritize
5. **Expectations drift**: Reset conversations periodically to maintain alignment
6. **Different ways of working have different expectations**: Agile, predictive, and hybrid projects trigger different stakeholder behaviors
7. **Manage difficult situations through clarity, escalation, and documentation**
8. **Understand informal power**: Title matters less than influence and trust

---

## Practice Scenario

**Context**: You are managing a software migration project. The CIO (your sponsor) wants speed—12 months. The VP of Operations wants quality—18 months with extensive testing. Your team estimates 15 months with acceptable risk.

**What are the competing expectations here?**
**What constraints or assumptions might be hidden?**
**How would you help the CIO and VP of Operations reach alignment?**
**If they cannot agree, what would you do?**
