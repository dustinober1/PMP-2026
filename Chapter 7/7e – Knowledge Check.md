# 7e – Knowledge Check: Stakeholder and Communication Mastery

This section provides scenario-based practice questions to test your understanding of stakeholder management and communication strategies. These questions reflect the types of scenarios you will encounter on the PMP exam—situations requiring you to apply stakeholder and communication concepts to real-world project challenges.

---

## Instructions

For each scenario, read the situation carefully and select the **best answer** based on the concepts covered in Chapter 7. The best answer aligns with PMI's approach to stakeholder engagement and communication.

Answers and detailed explanations follow the questions.

## Scenario 1: Stakeholder Analysis and Prioritization

You are managing a marketing technology platform upgrade for a mid-size SaaS company. The platform currently has 800 active users across 12 different departments. You have been asked to identify and engage stakeholders for the 6-month project.

As you begin stakeholder analysis, you identify the following people:
- **CEO**: Wants the upgrade to increase competitive advantage; has approved the $500K budget
- **Marketing Director**: Will use the new platform daily; has existing requirements that she is passionate about
- **IT Director**: Must ensure infrastructure is ready; concerned about implementation complexity
- **Product Manager**: Interested but oversee other products; moderate involvement
- **Sales Representatives** (15 people): Will use reporting features but have competing priorities
- **Support team**: Will answer user questions; low awareness of project currently
- **Accounting Manager**: Monitors budget; low interest in feature details
- **Individual Contributors** (400+ users): Will eventually use the platform; currently unaware

**Question 1.1**: Using the Power/Interest Matrix, where should you place the IT Director in your stakeholder prioritization?

A) Manage Closely (High Power, High Interest)
B) Keep Satisfied (High Power, Low Interest)
C) Keep Informed (Low Power, High Interest)
D) Monitor (Low Power, Low Interest)

**Answer: A) Manage Closely (High Power, High Interest)**

**Explanation**: The IT Director has high power because they control infrastructure decisions and can block or enable implementation. They have high interest because the implementation complexity affects their team and organization. This is a "Manage Closely" stakeholder. You should involve them in technical decisions, provide regular updates, and escalate concerns to them quickly.

Why other options are less correct:
- B) Would be appropriate if IT had high power but were not concerned about the project. IT is clearly interested in implementation complexity.
- C) Would be appropriate if IT could not influence decisions (e.g., a power user), but IT controls infrastructure.
- D) Would be appropriate if IT had neither power nor interest, which is not the case here.

---

**Question 1.2**: You identify the 400+ individual contributors (end users) in the "Monitor" quadrant (Low Power, Low Interest) for now. As the project moves toward launch (month 5), you expect them to move to a different quadrant. Which is most likely?

A) Manage Closely (High Power, High Interest)
B) Keep Satisfied (High Power, Low Interest)
C) Keep Informed (Low Power, High Interest)
D) Monitor (Low Power, Low Interest)

**Answer: C) Keep Informed (Low Power, High Interest)**

**Explanation**: As launch approaches, individual contributors' interest increases because the platform will directly affect their work. However, they retain low power—they do not make implementation decisions or control project scope. This is the "Keep Informed" quadrant. You should provide training, updates about launch, how the platform affects them, and feedback mechanisms.

Why other options are less correct:
- A) End users have high interest approaching launch, but they do not have high power over the implementation.
- B) Power does not increase for individual contributors.
- D) Interest will increase as they realize the platform affects their daily work.

This illustrates an important principle: **Stakeholder positions are not static. Update your analysis as the project progresses.**

---

**Question 1.3**: You discover a potential hidden stakeholder: the Customer Success team (12 people). They currently view help desk calls for the old platform. After launch, they will use the new platform's reporting to identify at-risk customers. Currently, you have not included them in the stakeholder analysis.

What should you do?

A) Continue without including them; they are support staff, not decision-makers
B) Add them to the Stakeholder Register with appropriate engagement strategy; understand how the project affects them
C) Wait until after launch to involve them; you are already in month 2 of a 6-month project
D) Have IT tell them about the platform change; IT is their manager

**Answer: B) Add them to the Stakeholder Register with appropriate engagement strategy; understand how the project affects them**

**Explanation**: The Customer Success team is a legitimate stakeholder because they are significantly affected by the platform change. Understanding how the project impacts them and involving them appropriately is critical. They might:
- Have insights into current pain points that the new platform should address
- Need training on the new platform before launch
- Be anxious about how changes affect their role

Adding them to the Stakeholder Register and determining how to engage them (likely "Keep Informed" or even "Manage Closely") ensures they feel valued and reduces risk of resistance later.

Why other options are less correct:
- A) Non-decision-makers can still be significantly affected and should be included in stakeholder analysis.
- C) Waiting until after launch means they are surprised by changes and may resist. Early engagement is better.
- D) While IT is their manager, your job as PM is to ensure all affected stakeholders are engaged appropriately.

**This illustrates**: Hidden stakeholders often emerge when you ask "Who else will this affect?" Discovery is ongoing, not one-time.

## Scenario 2: Stakeholder Expectations and Trade-offs

You are managing a business process improvement project. The scope is to redesign the order fulfillment process to reduce cycle time from 7 days to 3 days. The project has a 4-month timeline and a $200K budget.

Three months in, you discover a trade-off:
- To achieve the 3-day cycle time, you need to automate parts of the process that currently require manual quality checks by a specialist
- This change will eliminate 2 of 8 fulltime quality check positions

You have four key stakeholders:
- **Finance Director** (Sponsor): Primary stakeholder in cost reduction; originally approved project for efficiency gains
- **Operations Manager**: Manages the quality check team; concerned about changes affecting her team
- **HR Manager**: Has not been involved but will be affected (job transitions, retraining)
- **Quality Assurance Lead**: Expert in current quality process; will design new automated quality controls

**Question 2.1**: The Finance Director says, "This automation is exactly what we wanted. It is a cost savings win." The Operations Manager says, "I cannot support this. It eliminates jobs on my team."

This is a competing stakeholder expectation. What is the best first step to resolve this?

A) As PM, decide that the Finance Director is right (cost savings is the primary goal) and implement the automation
B) Abandon automation; keep the manual process to preserve the Operations Manager's jobs
C) Surface the conflict explicitly, help stakeholders understand each other's concerns, and escalate to the sponsor for a decision on priorities
D) Find a compromise: automate some tasks but keep both quality check positions

**Answer: C) Surface the conflict explicitly, help stakeholders understand each other's concerns, and escalate to the sponsor for a decision on priorities**

**Explanation**: This is a genuine stakeholder conflict where different legitimate interests clash. Your job is not to decide (that is the sponsor's job) but to:
1. Make the conflict visible: "I see Finance wants cost reduction through automation, and Operations is concerned about job loss. These are both legitimate concerns."
2. Help them understand each other: "Finance, help Operations understand why cost reduction is critical. Operations, help Finance understand the impact on your team."
3. Escalate: "This is a decision about project priorities that affects human resources. The Finance Director (Sponsor) needs to decide: Do we prioritize cost reduction, or do we prioritize preserving jobs, or do we find another approach?"
4. Execute the decision: Once the sponsor decides, both stakeholders understand the reasoning, even if they do not fully agree.

Why other options are less correct:
- A) Assumes one stakeholder is "right" without exploring the conflict. This ignores a legitimate concern and may cause resistance later.
- B) Abandons a core project objective (cost reduction) without exploring trade-offs.
- D) Sounds like a good compromise, but you should not create your own compromises for conflicts between stakeholders; that is the decision-maker's role. Your role is to surface the conflict with clear information.

**This illustrates**: Not all stakeholder conflicts can be resolved through negotiation. Some require decision-maker authority.

---

**Question 2.2**: The Finance Director has decided: "Proceed with automation. Cost reduction is the strategic priority. We will work with HR to manage job transitions."

Now you need to manage the Operations Manager's expectation. She is disappointed but accepts the decision. However, she asks, "When will this happen? It affects how I plan staffing."

What is the most important next step?

A) Tell her, "We will implement automation in month 4, so plan for transitions then"
B) Involve her in designing the transition plan so she understands the timeline and can plan accordingly
C) Escalate to the Finance Director; this is a business decision, not a PM decision
D) Rush implementation to get it over with quickly

**Answer: B) Involve her in designing the transition plan so she understands the timeline and can plan accordingly**

**Explanation**: You have made a difficult decision that affects the Operations Manager. Now you need to:
1. Mitigate the impact by involving her in how the transition happens
2. Give her clarity on timeline (essential for her planning)
3. Show respect for her role by treating her as a key stakeholder in the transition
4. Build back trust after the disappointing decision

Involving her in designing the transition plan does all of these things. It also likely yields a better transition plan because she understands the operational constraints.

Why other options are less correct:
- A) Gives timeline but does not involve her in planning; misses opportunity to build alignment.
- C) This is not just a business decision; operations is also affected and should be involved in transition planning.
- D) Rushing does not resolve the underlying concern and may create a poor transition plan.

**This illustrates**: After a difficult decision, involve affected stakeholders in implementation planning to mitigate impact and rebuild trust.

## Scenario 3: Communication Planning and Channels

You are managing a digital transformation initiative across a global company. You have stakeholders in 6 countries with time zones spanning 14 hours. Key stakeholders include:
- **Steering Committee** (6 executives): Make decisions and allocate resources
- **Design Team** (12 people): Designing the new processes and technologies
- **Pilot Teams** (3 teams of 8 people each in different regions): Testing the design in their local context
- **IT Operations** (20 people): Will implement and support the final solution
- **Employees** (2,000+ people): Will eventually use the new processes

You are asked to develop a communication plan.

**Question 3.1**: For the Steering Committee, what is the most appropriate communication frequency and format?

A) Weekly email updates with detailed status of all activities
B) Monthly in-person meetings with detailed status reports (15+ pages)
C) Daily Slack updates so they are always informed
D) Monthly high-level summaries with weekly escalations for critical issues; meetings quarterly or as decisions are needed

**Answer: D) Monthly high-level summaries with weekly escalations for critical issues; meetings quarterly or as decisions are needed**

**Explanation**: Steering committees are typically "Keep Satisfied" stakeholders (high power, moderate/low interest in day-to-day details). They need:
- **Frequency**: Regular enough to stay informed (monthly), but not so frequent that you waste their time (not daily or weekly for routine updates)
- **Format**: High-level summaries (one-page or executive summary), not detailed status reports they do not have time to read
- **Escalation path**: When critical decisions or issues arise, you escalate immediately (weekly escalations, not waiting until monthly meeting)
- **In-person meetings**: Quarterly or as-needed for decisions; do not schedule unnecessary meetings

Why other options are less correct:
- A) Weekly email updates for executives exceeds their information needs and creates noise.
- B) Monthly in-person meetings are too frequent and 15+ page reports are too detailed for executives.
- C) Daily updates create information overload and would damage credibility (too much noise).

**This illustrates**: Communication frequency and detail should match stakeholder role and needs, not be one-size-fits-all.

**ECO Connection**: People Domain – Task 2: Develop a communication approach to support the project and achieve organizational objectives

---

**Question 3.2**: For the 2,000+ employees who will eventually use the new processes, when should communication about the transformation begin?

A) During pilot phase (month 4), when design is proven
B) At launch (month 6), when the new process goes live
C) During design phase (month 1-2), at a high level explaining the vision and seeking feedback
D) After launch (month 7+), during training and support phase

**Answer: C) During design phase (month 1-2), at a high level explaining the vision and seeking feedback**

**Explanation**: Early communication about transformation serves multiple purposes:
1. **Reduces anxiety**: Employees hear about changes from official sources, not rumors
2. **Gathers input**: Early employees can provide perspective on what is working/not working with current process
3. **Builds support**: Employees who understand the "why" are more likely to support the change
4. **Provides lead time**: People can mentally prepare for change

The communication at the design phase is high-level (vision, business case, timeline) not detailed (they do not need implementation details yet). It invites feedback ("What do you think we should prioritize?") and sets expectations ("We are testing in pilots before full rollout").

Why other options are less correct:
- A) Waiting until pilot phase means employees are surprised by the transformation; less time to prepare.
- B) Waiting until launch means no advance notice; maximum surprise and resistance.
- D) Focusing communication only on training/support misses the opportunity for early engagement.

**This illustrates**: Effective change communication starts early, with vision and reasoning, then progresses to detailed how-to later.

**ECO Connection**: People Domain – Task 2: Manage stakeholder expectations; develop a communication approach to achieve organizational objectives

---

**Question 3.3**: You have team members in 6 time zones (e.g., Sydney is 14 hours ahead of San Francisco). For the Design Team daily standup, what is the best approach?

A) Schedule a single time that works for everyone (e.g., 3 AM for Sydney, 1 PM for San Francisco)
B) Rotate the meeting time so no one is always at an inconvenient hour
C) Hold synchronous standups in regional groups (Sydney region at 9 AM Sydney time, San Francisco region at 9 AM PT), then have designated people share across regions
D) Eliminate synchronous meetings; use asynchronous updates via email or shared document

**Answer: C) Hold synchronous standups in regional groups (Sydney region at 9 AM Sydney time, San Francisco region at 9 AM PT), then have designated people share across regions**

**Explanation**: You need daily coordination (synchronous communication is best for quick feedback and blockers), but forcing everyone into one meeting at an impossible time:
- Creates fatigue and resentment
- Reduces participation (people multi-task when it is inconvenient)
- May violate work-life balance expectations

Regional synchronous standups respect local time zones while maintaining daily communication. Having designated people share outcomes across regions (asynchronous handoff) keeps everyone informed.

Example: Sydney team meets 9 AM Sydney time and documents key blockers. San Francisco team meets 9 AM PT and gets an overnight summary of Sydney's blockers and progress. This creates a "relay" of communication that works globally.

Why other options are less correct:
- A) 3 AM participation destroys morale and effectiveness.
- B) Rotating times spreads inconvenience but does not eliminate it; people in Asia always get middle-of-night meetings.
- D) Asynchronous only misses real-time problem-solving that agile teams need.

**This illustrates**: In global teams, match communication to working hours and use hybrid synchronous/asynchronous approaches.

## Scenario 4: Adapting Communication Style and Culture

You are implementing a financial reporting system across three regional offices:
- **Headquarters** (North America): Formal, hierarchical, data-driven, English-speaking
- **Europe Office** (France, Germany, UK): More relationship-oriented, moderate hierarchy, direct communication
- **Asia Office** (Singapore, Japan, India): Relationship-first, high respect for hierarchy, indirect communication preference

The system will change how regional offices report to headquarters. There is some resistance in Asia office to "new requirements from headquarters."

**Question 4.1**: You have a key message: "The new system standardizes reporting so headquarters can make faster decisions, which benefits everyone."

How should you adapt this message for the Asia office?

A) Keep the message the same; standardization is the business case everywhere
B) Emphasize that headquarters is requiring this (use your authority/hierarchy to justify it)
C) Frame it as an opportunity for Asia office to influence how reporting works and to strengthen relationships with headquarters through better communication
D) Avoid mentioning the system change to Asia office until it is mandatory; they will eventually accept it

**Answer: C) Frame it as an opportunity for Asia office to influence how reporting works and to strengthen relationships with headquarters through better communication**

**Explanation**: The Asia office context (relationship-first, indirect, high respect for hierarchy) requires adaptation:

**Wrong approach (A)**: "Standardization" is a headquarters priority, not necessarily an Asia office priority. It may sound like imposition.

**Wrong approach (B)**: "Headquarters requires this" uses hierarchy as justification. While Asia respects hierarchy, this framing sounds top-down and authoritarian, not collaborative.

**Right approach (C)**: Frames the system as:
- A relationship opportunity ("strengthen relationships with HQ through better communication")
- Giving voice ("influence how reporting works" - their input matters)
- Respectful of hierarchy but collaborative (not "you must do this" but "let us work together")

This reframes the same system change in culturally appropriate language.

Why option D is completely wrong:
- Avoiding communication creates distrust, rumors, and much stronger resistance later.

**This illustrates**: The same project can be framed very differently based on cultural context. Adapt messaging, not just delivering it.

**ECO Connection**: People Domain – Task 2: Communicate project information to meet stakeholder expectations; take into account organizational, cultural, and environmental considerations

---

**Question 4.2**: You are explaining the new reporting system to three different groups. What is the best approach?

A) Create one standardized presentation and deliver it to all groups
B) Create presentations tailored to each region's communication preference and cultural context
C) Translate the English presentation to French and Japanese
D) Have each regional office leader present to their own team; you just provide the content

**Answer: B) Create presentations tailored to each region's communication preference and cultural context**

**Explanation**: While translation (C) is helpful, it is not sufficient. Communication adaptation goes deeper:

**Headquarters version**:
- Focus: Business case, metrics (faster decision-making), implementation timeline
- Format: Efficient, data-focused
- Structure: "Here is what, here is why, here are the metrics"
- Interaction: Q&A, challenge the assumptions

**Europe version**:
- Focus: Business case, process details, how they are involved
- Format: Professional but relationship-aware ("we are doing this together")
- Structure: "Here is the context, here is what we are asking, here is how you shape it"
- Interaction: Discussion and input gathering

**Asia version**:
- Focus: Vision, relationship opportunity, respect for their expertise, how they will contribute
- Format: Formal, respectful, high-context
- Structure: "Here is the broader picture, we value your perspective, let us discuss"
- Interaction: Listening more than presenting; asking for input

One standardized presentation misses these nuances. Having regional leaders present is good, but you should provide them tailored guidance, not just generic content.

Why option A is incorrect:
- One-size-fits-all presentations miss cultural nuances and are less effective.

**This illustrates**: Effective communication adapts to audience, not just language.

**ECO Connection**: People Domain – Task 2: Communicate project information by choosing the most effective format and media to suit the audience

---

**Question 4.3**: During the Asia office rollout meeting, a senior manager says (indirectly, through questions): "I am not sure this new system respects our regional processes. How can HQ understand our unique needs?"

This is resistance, but expressed indirectly. How should you respond?

A) "Our processes are becoming standardized across all regions. Your regional processes will need to adjust."
B) "The system is required by headquarters. You will need to implement it."
C) Listen to the underlying concern ("You worry the system will not work for your region"), acknowledge it, and invite detailed discussion of how regional needs can be addressed within the standardized system
D) "I understand your concern. Let me take this to headquarters and see if we can make exceptions for your region."

**Answer: C) Listen to the underlying concern ("You worry the system will not work for your region"), acknowledge it, and invite detailed discussion of how regional needs can be addressed within the standardized system**

**Explanation**: In indirect communication cultures, resistance is expressed through questions, not direct statements. The question "How can HQ understand our unique needs?" really means "I am worried HQ does not understand our unique needs and this system will not work for us."

Your response should:
1. **Listen and acknowledge**: "I hear your concern that the new system might not work for your regional processes. That is important."
2. **Invite dialogue**: "Tell me more about your regional processes and where you see potential conflicts with the standardized system."
3. **Show problem-solving approach**: "Let us work together to see how we can meet the standardized requirements while respecting your regional needs."

This response:
- Respects the indirect communication style (you read the real meaning from the question)
- Shows respect for their expertise ("your regional processes matter")
- Provides a path forward without dismissing their concern

Why other options are incorrect:
- A) Dismisses their concern; may increase resistance
- B) Uses authority without understanding their concern; likely to entrench resistance
- D) Makes promises you cannot keep and undermines standardization

**This illustrates**: In indirect communication cultures, listen for the underlying concern in the question, then address it respectfully.

## Scenario 5: Integrating Multiple Stakeholder Challenges

You are managing a 12-month software modernization project. You have multiple, interconnected stakeholder challenges:

**Current situation (month 2)**:
- The project is on track technically
- The Architecture Team (high power, high interest) believes the team needs 18 months, not 12, to build properly
- The Finance Director (sponsor, high power) is committed to 12 months for budget reasons
- The Product Manager (high interest) is excited but wants to add features (scope creep)
- Regional users (low power, not yet engaged) have not been told about changes coming in their workflows

**Question 5.1**: You have three competing demands:
1. Architecture Team wants realistic timeline (18 months)
2. Finance Director committed timeline is 12 months
3. Product Manager wants more features

As PM, what is your primary responsibility?

A) Choose the most technically correct option (Architecture Team) and convince Finance Director to accept 18 months
B) Choose the sponsor's option (Finance Director, 12 months) because sponsors have ultimate authority
C) Find a compromise (e.g., 15 months, reduced features) that satisfies everyone
D) Surface the trade-offs clearly, help stakeholders understand the consequences of each choice, and escalate to the sponsor for a decision with full information

**Answer: D) Surface the trade-offs clearly, help stakeholders understand the consequences of each choice, and escalate to the sponsor for a decision with full information**

**Explanation**: Your role as PM is not to choose (that is the sponsor's job) but to ensure the decision is made with full information.

You should surface:
- **Architecture Team's view**: 18 months allows proper technical foundation. Risk of 12-month timeline: [specific technical risks]
- **Finance Director's view**: 12 months aligns with budget and business case. If extended, impact: [cost increase, delayed ROI]
- **Product Manager's view**: More features increase value. If timeline compresses, which features are cut?

Then ask the Sponsor:
- "Given these trade-offs, which is the priority: timeline, technical quality, or scope?"
- "If 12 months is mandatory, what features do we cut and what risks do we accept?"

This approach:
- Ensures the decision is informed, not based on politics or assumption
- Makes trade-offs visible
- Distributes accountability (the sponsor chose with full knowledge)
- Allows you to execute confidently

Why other options are incorrect:
- A) One team's view, even if technically correct, should not override decision-maker authority
- B) Blindly following the sponsor without surfacing trade-offs means you execute a decision made without full information; you may encounter bigger problems later
- C) Compromises that no one owns often fail; it is better to have the decision-maker choose clearly

**This illustrates**: Your job is not to make hard decisions; it is to surface options and trade-offs so decision-makers can choose wisely.

**ECO Connection**: People Domain – Task 3: Analyze and document stakeholder needs; determine, confirm, or update project success criteria

---

**Question 5.2**: The Finance Director decides: "Keep the 12-month timeline. I trust the team to find a way. Product Manager, we will add features in phase 2 if we have time. Architecture Team, you are creative; work with the approach that is realistic."

The Architecture Team is frustrated. The Product Manager is somewhat disappointed. How should you now communicate this decision to maintain engagement?

A) "The sponsor decided on 12 months. That is the decision. Let's move forward."
B) "The sponsor decided on 12 months for business reasons. To succeed, we will need to [specific approach: e.g., use agile iteration, defer non-essential features, build a scalable foundation now for phase 2]. Here is my confidence level and what could go wrong: [risks]. You have a role in this solution: [specific asks]."
C) Revisit the decision in 3 months after gathering more information
D) Send a written decision memo without discussion; let the teams work it out

**Answer: B) "The sponsor decided on 12 months for business reasons. To succeed, we will need to [specific approach: e.g., use agile iteration, defer non-essential features, build a scalable foundation now for phase 2]. Here is my confidence level and what could go wrong: [risks]. You have a role in this solution: [specific asks]."**

**Explanation**: The decision is made, but now you need to bring stakeholders along. This response:

1. **Acknowledges the decision**: No ambiguity; the timeline is set.
2. **Explains the business why**: Helps people understand it is not arbitrary.
3. **Outlines the approach**: Shows how you will solve the problem (not just saying "figure it out").
4. **Acknowledges reality**: "Here is my confidence level and here is what could go wrong" (shows you are not in denial about risks).
5. **Involves them in solution**: Gives them a role to play in making the timeline work.

This maintains engagement because:
- Architecture Team sees you have thought through how to build a scalable foundation in 12 months
- Product Manager sees that features will be considered (phase 2 pathway)
- Both teams feel heard and part of the solution

Why other options are incorrect:
- A) "Shut up and move forward" language kills engagement and increases risk of low commitment
- C) Revisiting the decision after committing creates instability and confusion
- D) Not discussing allows people to stay frustrated and disengage

**This illustrates**: After a decision, own it, explain it, outline the approach, and involve people in making it work.

---

**Question 5.3**: You realize you have not yet communicated the project changes to regional users (low power, not yet interested). When should you communicate and what should you say?

A) Wait until month 10 (two months before go-live) to start training; that is soon enough
B) Communicate now at a high level about the vision and the change coming; explain what it means for them; ask for early input
C) Have regional managers communicate the change to their teams; this is their responsibility
D) Include the change in the standard all-hands meeting; that is efficient

**Answer: B) Communicate now at a high level about the vision and the change coming; explain what it means for them; ask for early input**

**Explanation**: Early communication with end users (those affected but not driving the project):
- Reduces surprise and rumor
- Gives people time to mentally prepare for change
- Allows you to gather input from people who know the current workflow ("What is painful about the current system?" "What should we preserve?")
- Builds support before launch

The communication at this stage should be:
- **High-level**: Vision and business case, not technical details ("We are modernizing our systems to be faster and easier to use")
- **Impact-focused**: How it affects them ("Here is what will change in your workflow")
- **Invitational**: "We want to hear from you" (ask for input on current pain points)

Why other options are incorrect:
- A) Waiting until month 10 gives little time for people to adjust mentally and causes resistance at launch
- C) Having managers communicate is good (cascading communication), but you (as PM) should still communicate the vision and ensure consistent messaging
- D) All-hands meeting is efficient but misses the opportunity for focused conversation about impact and input gathering

**This illustrates**: Communicate changes early to affected people, explain the impact, and invite input. Do not wait until launch to tell people about disruption.

## Final Reflection Questions

These questions require you to reflect on concepts from Chapter 7 as a whole:

**Reflection 1**: You are managing a project in a culture where decisions are made hierarchically (top-down) and communication is indirect. What is the most important adaptation you must make to your stakeholder engagement approach?

Answer: You must respect hierarchy and invest in relationships with decision-makers early. You must learn to read indirect communication (questions, suggestions) and respond respectfully without requiring direct confrontation. You should present information in formal, high-context ways, not quick conversations.

---

**Reflection 2**: A stakeholder complains, "I did not know this was happening. I would have objected." You realize they are right—you assumed someone else was communicating and did not verify. What should you do?

Answer: Apologize for the oversight. Acknowledge their concern. Explain what happened and why (e.g., "I assumed the finance team would tell you, but I should have verified"). Update your stakeholder register and communication plan to ensure they are directly included going forward. Ask if you can address their objection now or if it is too late.

---

**Reflection 3**: You have a stakeholder who is very skeptical about your project. Their influence is significant. What is your priority?

Answer: Listen to their skepticism without defensiveness. Understand what is driving it (fear, past experience, legitimate concerns). Do not try to convince them quickly. Involve them in solutions and show (through action, not words) that you are competent, honest, and addressing their concerns. Skeptical people often become the strongest advocates once trust is built.
