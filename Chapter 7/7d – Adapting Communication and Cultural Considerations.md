# 7d – Adapting Communication and Cultural Considerations

Sarah has a solid communication plan. But she quickly discovers that one-size-fits-all communication does not work. The same message presented differently to different people yields wildly different results.

She sends a detailed 15-page technical specification to the CFO, who reads only the executive summary. She sends an email with high-level status to the development team, who need specific technical details. She presents the renovation timeline in a linear schedule to the Finance Manager, who understands it best through a Gantt chart with budget burn-down.

Later, when working with her transformation program across three regions, she notices that the communication style that resonates in the headquarters does not land the same way in regional offices. Regional directors are skeptical of the same message that the steering committee embraced.

This section is about **adapting communication** to the person, the context, and the culture. It is the art of saying the same message in different ways so that it reaches people where they are.

## 7.1 Communication Styles and Preferences

People have different communication preferences. Some are extroverted and thrive in group discussion. Others are introverted and prefer written communication to process ideas before responding. Some are detail-oriented and need information laid out systematically. Others are big-picture thinkers and want to know the why before diving into the what.

### 7.1.1 The DISC Model of Communication Styles

One useful framework is DISC (Dominance, Influence, Steadiness, Conscientiousness), which describes four broad communication preferences:

**D – Dominance (Direct, Results-Oriented)**
- Wants to know: "What is the bottom line? What is the decision or action?"
- Prefers: Direct communication, quick decisions, focus on results
- Does not like: Long explanations, small talk, delays, lack of clarity
- How to communicate: Get to the point fast. Lead with the decision or outcome. "Here is what I recommend and why" rather than "Here are 5 options let me walk you through the pros and cons of each"
- Example: The CFO (D) wants a 1-page summary, not 15 pages. The core message: "This will cost X and save us Y. Should we do it? Yes or no?"

**I – Influence (Engaging, People-Oriented)**
- Wants to know: "How does this affect people? What is the team saying? Are people excited?"
- Prefers: Conversations, inclusion, storytelling, recognition
- Does not like: Isolation, conflict, being ignored, loss of relationships
- How to communicate: Tell stories. Involve them in discussions. Emphasize team and people aspects. "The team is really excited about this; they see how it will make their lives better."
- Example: A senior team member (I) cares about how the transformation affects the team culture. Lead with "This will help us work together more effectively" rather than "This will reduce processing time from 3 days to 1 day."

**S – Steadiness (Stable, Process-Oriented)**
- Wants to know: "How will this work? What is the step-by-step plan? How will we avoid disruption?"
- Prefers: Detailed processes, advance warning, stability, clear procedures
- Does not like: Surprises, rapid change, ambiguity, instability
- How to communicate: Provide detailed plans and timelines. Walk through the process step by step. "Here is how we will transition. Here is the training plan. You will not be left hanging."
- Example: Operations Manager (S) needs a detailed transition plan, not just "We are changing the process." Step by step: "Week 1 we do X, week 2 we do Y, by week 3 the new process is live. You will be trained on all steps."

**C – Conscientiousness (Careful, Detail-Oriented)**
- Wants to know: "What are the details? What is the quality standard? What could go wrong?"
- Prefers: Data, accuracy, systematic analysis, evidence
- Does not like: Oversimplification, errors, lack of rigor, insufficient information
- How to communicate: Provide data and evidence. "Here is our analysis showing this is the right approach." Include details. Acknowledge limitations. "We do not know X, here is how we will handle uncertainty."
- Example: IT Director (C) wants the architecture documented, the trade-offs analyzed, risk mitigation planned. Not just "Here is what we will build."

**Example from Sarah's Projects**:

The Renovation Project Kickoff:
- CFO (D): "We have $500K and March 15. The contractor has a solid track record. We are proceeding." [Decision, not details]
- Facilities Manager (S): Here is the timeline—weeks 1-4 demolition, weeks 5-10 construction, weeks 11-12 finishing. You will be kept informed of milestones." [Process, step by step]
- Project Coordinator (I): "This is a great opportunity for our team to work with an excellent contractor. We will learn a lot and deliver something we are proud of." [People and relationships]
- Finance Oversight (C): Here are the budget projections month by month, the risks we identified, and our mitigation plans. We will have contingency for [specific risks]." [Data and analysis]

All four communications convey the same project. But each person receives it in their language, with the information they care about most.

### 7.1.2 Identifying Communication Preferences

How do you know someone's communication preference? You can:
1. **Ask directly**: "How do you prefer to get information? Do you like detail or high-level summary? Meetings or written? Big picture or step-by-step?"
2. **Observe**: Watch how people communicate with you. How they prefer to receive information often mirrors how they prefer to give it.
3. **Ask colleagues**: "What is the best way to communicate with [person]? What matters to them?"
4. **Use a framework like DISC**: There are assessments, but most importantly, you can recognize the patterns.

### 7.1.3 Adapting to Individual Preferences

Once Sarah knows someone's preference, she adjusts:

**For CFO (D)**:
- Lead meetings with "Here is the decision we need to make"
- Provide a one-page summary, not a 15-page report
- Highlight the business impact (revenue, cost, risk) not the process
- Move to decision faster

**For Finance Manager (S)**:
- Provide a detailed process/timeline
- Communicate changes in advance when possible
- Walk through step-by-step how the system will work
- Provide training and certainty

**For Team Lead (I)**:
- Involve them in discussions and decisions
- Recognize their contributions publicly
- Focus on how it affects the team and relationships
- Create opportunities for them to be advocates

**For Architect (C)**:
- Provide thorough documentation and analysis
- Anticipate detailed questions and answer them upfront
- Acknowledge what you do not know and how you will find out
- Show the rigor and thinking behind decisions

**Key insight**: You are not changing what you say; you are adapting *how* you say it and *what* you emphasize.

## 7.2 Organizational Culture and Communication Norms

Beyond individual preferences, every organization has a culture with unspoken norms about how communication works.

### 7.2.1 Understanding Organizational Culture Dimensions

**Formal vs. Informal**:
- **Formal culture** (e.g., financial institutions, government agencies): Communication is structured, documented, formal. You write "re: Project Status Q3" not "Project update—check it out!"
- **Informal culture** (e.g., startups, creative agencies): Communication is casual, conversational, less documented. Slack messages are more common than formal emails.
- How to adapt: If your organization is formal, document decisions and use structured formats. If it is informal, be conversational and flexible.

**Hierarchical vs. Flat**:
- **Hierarchical culture**: Communication flows up and down through levels. You tell your manager, who tells their manager, etc. Decision authority is clear. You respect levels.
- **Flat culture**: Communication is across silos. Anyone can talk to anyone. Decision-making is more collaborative.
- How to adapt: In hierarchical organizations, loop the right managers in before communicating down. In flat organizations, communicate widely and early.

**Change-Averse vs. Innovation-Oriented**:
- **Change-averse**: Organizations that like stability and proven approaches. New initiatives are questioned; you need evidence and a clear plan.
- **Innovation-oriented**: Organizations that embrace change and experimentation. Detailed plans are less important than speed and learning.
- How to adapt: In change-averse organizations, present thorough plans and risk mitigation. In innovation-oriented organizations, emphasize learning and iteration.

**Data-Driven vs. Intuition-Driven**:
- **Data-driven**: Organizations that want metrics, analysis, evidence. Decisions are justified with data.
- **Intuition-driven**: Organizations that trust judgment and relationships. "The data shows X but we feel Y" can override data.
- How to adapt: In data-driven organizations, lead with metrics and analysis. In intuition-driven organizations, lead with vision and relationships, and use data to support.

**Risk-Averse vs. Risk-Tolerant**:
- **Risk-averse**: Organizations that highlight potential problems and plan for worst-case scenarios.
- **Risk-tolerant**: Organizations that emphasize opportunities and are comfortable with uncertainty.
- How to adapt: In risk-averse organizations, detail risks and mitigation. In risk-tolerant organizations, emphasize opportunity and keep risk discussion focused on critical issues.

### 7.2.2 Sarah's Organizational Culture Assessment

Sarah works in a moderately large financial services company. The culture is:
- **Moderately formal**: Documentation matters; meeting notes are expected; emails should be professional. But conversations can be casual if the relationship allows.
- **Hierarchical**: There are clear reporting lines. People respect authority, but innovation is valued.
- **Moderately change-averse**: Change requires justification, but it is happening (digital transformation is a priority).
- **Data-driven**: Finance people (which is her stakeholder base) want metrics and evidence.
- **Risk-averse**: Risk is discussed; contingencies are planned; failures are not celebrated.

Armed with this understanding, Sarah adjusts her communication:
- Written updates are professional and documented (not casual)
- She includes her manager in key discussions (hierarchical)
- She leads with business case and risk mitigation (change-averse, risk-averse)
- She includes metrics and data (data-driven)
- She celebrates learning from failures, not failures themselves (risk-averse)

## 7.3 Cross-Cultural Communication

If Sarah's organization spans multiple geographies or cultural backgrounds, cultural differences affect communication.

### 7.3.1 Key Cultural Dimensions

**Direct vs. Indirect Communication**:
- **Direct**: Say what you mean directly. "This is not working. We need to change it." (e.g., German, Dutch, Israeli cultures)
- **Indirect**: Suggest carefully, read between the lines. "This approach has some interesting aspects. Have we considered alternatives?" (e.g., Japanese, Thai, Arabic cultures)
- How to adapt: Know your audience. In a direct culture, be straightforward. In an indirect culture, soften suggestions and ask questions rather than state problems.

**Relationship-First vs. Task-First**:
- **Relationship-first**: Build relationships before diving into work. Small talk, getting to know people, trust-building matters. (e.g., Latin American, Middle Eastern, Southern European cultures)
- **Task-first**: Get to the point quickly. Time is limited; let's focus on the work. (e.g., Northern European, North American cultures)
- How to adapt: In relationship-first cultures, invest time in getting to know people before jumping into business. In task-first cultures, be efficient with time and focused on outcomes.

**Time Orientation** (Monochronic vs. Polychronic):
- **Monochronic**: Time is linear and limited. Meetings start on time and end on time. One thing at a time. (e.g., Northern Europe, North America)
- **Polychronic**: Time is flexible. Relationships and context matter more than clock time. Multiple things can happen at once. (e.g., Middle East, Latin America, Southern Europe, Africa)
- How to adapt: In monochronic cultures, start on time and manage time tightly. In polychronic cultures, allow flexibility and do not be offended if side conversations happen during meetings.

**Hierarchy and Authority**:
- **High power distance**: Clear hierarchy is respected and expected. You respect authority; you do not question your manager publicly. (e.g., Asian, Middle Eastern, Latin American cultures)
- **Low power distance**: Hierarchy is minimized. You can question authority; people are equal regardless of title. (e.g., Nordic, Northern European, North American cultures)
- How to adapt: In high power distance cultures, respect hierarchy and use formal titles. In low power distance cultures, be more egalitarian and open to challenges.

### 7.3.2 Sarah's Cross-Cultural Challenge

Sarah's transformation program spans three regions with different cultural norms:
- **Headquarters** (North American, task-first, low power distance, monochronic): Direct, efficient, egalitarian
- **Europe office** (Western European, direct but relationship-conscious, moderate power distance, monochronic): Professional but relationship-aware
- **Asia office** (Asian, indirect, high power distance, polychronic): Hierarchical, relationship-first, flexible with time

Sarah's adapted communication strategy:

**To Headquarters**:
- Direct, focused on business case and metrics
- Meetings start on time, end on time
- "Here is what we decided and why"
- Open to questions and challenges

**To Europe**:
- Professional and structured, but with acknowledgment of relationships
- "We have worked together well; I trust your perspective"
- Thorough explanation but still efficient
- Formal but collegial tone

**To Asia**:
- More formal, respectful of hierarchy
- Relationship-building before business
- Use intermediaries (local managers) for some communications
- More flexibility with timing
- More indirect: "We are considering several approaches. What do you think would work best in your context?"

## 7.4 Communication for Different Organizational Levels

Communication also adapts by organizational level:

### 7.4.1 Communicating to Executives

Executives are busy, focused on strategy and enterprise impact. They have limited time.

**What executives care about**:
- Business impact (revenue, cost, risk, strategic alignment)
- Top risks and mitigation
- Key decisions and approvals needed
- Bottom-line status (on track, at risk, off track)

**How to communicate with executives**:
- **Lead with the business case**: "This initiative will save $2M annually and improve customer satisfaction by 30%"
- **One-page summary**: You might have a 50-page plan, but the executive summary is one page
- **Visual presentation**: Executives often prefer charts and metrics over narrative text
- **Decision clarity**: "Here is what we decided and why" not "Here are 5 options, what do you think?"
- **Risk focus**: "These are the three biggest risks. Here is how we are managing them."

**Frequency**: Monthly or quarterly, plus ad-hoc for critical decisions

### 7.4.2 Communicating to Team Members

Team members need detailed information to do their work. They care about tasks, deadlines, expectations, and support.

**What team members care about**:
- What they are responsible for (task clarity)
- When it is due (deadlines)
- Who they work with (dependencies)
- What they need from others (blockers, requests)
- How they are doing (feedback)

**How to communicate with team members**:
- **Detailed and specific**: "Your task is to [specific task]. It is due [date]. It depends on [who], so confirm with them by [date]. Here is what success looks like: [criteria]"
- **Regular check-ins**: Daily standups or weekly one-on-ones
- **Support and feedback**: "How are you doing? What do you need? Here is what I see working well."
- **Clear expectations**: No ambiguity about what is expected

**Frequency**: Daily (standups) or at least weekly

### 7.4.3 Communicating to End Users

End users are affected by the project but not driving it. They care about how it affects them and what support they will get.

**What end users care about**:
- How does this change affect my work? (Impact)
- When does it happen? (Timeline)
- Will I get support? (Training, help desk)
- What is in it for me? (Benefit)

**How to communicate with end users**:
- **Use their language**: Not technical jargon, but clear explanation of impact and benefit
- **Practical**: "Here is how to do [new process]" with step-by-step instructions
- **Reassurance**: "You will not be left hanging; here is the training and support plan"
- **Multiple channels**: Email, videos, in-person training, help desk
- **Feedback loop**: "Try it and let us know what is working or not"

**Frequency**: Pre-launch training and kickoff, then ongoing support

## 7.5 Managing Sensitive and Difficult Communications

Some communications are inherently difficult—delivering bad news, addressing conflicts, discussing layoffs, admitting mistakes.

### 7.5.1 Delivering Bad News

When the timeline is slipping, costs are exceeding budget, or something is not working as planned, you have to communicate honestly while maintaining credibility.

**The framework for bad news**:

1. **Tell the truth, clearly**: "We are not going to make the March 15 deadline. It is now April 15."
   - Do not soften language to avoid the news
   - Do not bury the bad news in other information

2. **Explain why, honestly**: "During demolition, we discovered asbestos. Remediation takes 4 weeks. That is the additional time."
   - Give the real reason, not a manufactured excuse
   - If you made a mistake, acknowledge it

3. **Explain what you are doing about it**: "We are following all EPA procedures. We have engaged a certified abatement contractor. We are fast-tracking inspection and clearance."
   - Show that you have a plan
   - Demonstrate competence and action

4. **Set new expectations**: "New completion date is April 15. We are notifying all stakeholders today. Here is our new timeline and plan."
   - Be clear about the new expectation
   - Do not leave ambiguity

5. **Commit to communication**: "I will update the steering committee weekly until we are back on track. You will have visibility into progress."
   - Stakeholders trust you more if you over-communicate during crisis than if you go silent

**What NOT to do**:
- Do not blame others (even if true, it sounds like excuse-making)
- Do not minimize ("It is just a 4-week slip, not a big deal") unless you are confident the stakeholder will agree
- Do not over-apologize (unless you made a major error; otherwise it erodes confidence)
- Do not go silent while you figure out what to do; communicate what you know and when you will update

### 7.5.2 Addressing Conflict or Criticism

When a stakeholder is unhappy or critical, how you respond matters.

**The framework for addressing criticism**:

1. **Listen first**: Let them say what they think without interrupting. Their concern is real to them, regardless of whether you think it is justified.
   - "Help me understand your concern."
   - "Tell me more about that."

2. **Acknowledge their perspective**: Not necessarily agree, but acknowledge that you heard them.
   - "I hear that you are concerned about the timeline slipping affecting your budget."
   - Not: "That is not a real concern" or "You are wrong"

3. **Provide your perspective**: Explain your view, with evidence if available.
   - "I understand the concern. The asbestos discovery was unexpected. Here is how we are managing the timeline to minimize further slip."

4. **Find a path forward**: Either agree to change direction, or explain why you are not changing, and what you are doing to address the concern.
   - "Based on your feedback, we are going to split the project into two phases so critical functions go live by March 15."
   - Or: "I understand your concern, but we believe the current approach is better because [reason]. Here is how we will monitor and adjust if it is not working."

5. **Follow up**: Circle back to confirm whether the concern is addressed.
   - "I wanted to check—does the phased approach address your concerns about the March deadline?"

### 7.5.3 Difficult Personal Conversations

Sometimes you have to have hard conversations about performance, role changes, job loss, or interpersonal issues.

**General principles**:
- **Private**: These conversations should be one-on-one, not in groups
- **Prepared**: Know what you want to say ahead of time
- **Honest**: Say what needs to be said, even if it is difficult
- **Respectful**: Maintain dignity and respect for the person
- **Clear**: Leave no ambiguity about expectations or next steps
- **Documented**: If it is serious (performance, job loss), document afterward

**Example**: One team member is struggling with the new system. You need to address it.

*Opening*: "I wanted to talk with you about how things are going on the project. I have noticed [specific observations]. I am concerned about [impact]. What is going on from your perspective?"

*Listen*: Let them explain. Maybe they are overwhelmed, maybe they do not understand expectations, maybe they are dealing with personal challenges.

*Clarify*: "Here is what I need to see moving forward: [specific expectations]. I am going to support you by [specific support]. Let's check in weekly to see how it is going."

*Follow through*: Actually provide the support and check in regularly.

## 7.6 When Communication Fails and How to Recover

Despite best efforts, communication sometimes fails.

### 7.6.1 Types of Communication Failures

**Miscommunication**: You said X, they heard Y
- Example: "In a few weeks" (you meant 3-4 weeks, they understood 10-12 weeks)

**Non-communication**: You thought someone knew, but they did not
- Example: You announced a decision in a steering committee meeting; the operations person did not attend and did not find out from anyone else

**Misunderstanding**: The words were communicated, but the meaning was not understood
- Example: You explained a technical change; the end user did not understand how it affects their work

**Loss of trust**: The words were understood, but the stakeholder no longer believes them
- Example: You said "On track" twice, then it slipped. Now they assume you are not being honest.

### 7.6.2 Recovery from Communication Failure

When you realize communication has failed:

1. **Acknowledge quickly**: Do not wait, hoping it goes away. Address it as soon as you realize.
2. **Apologize for the failure**: "I should have communicated this better. I am sorry you were surprised."
3. **Clarify the correct information**: "Here is what actually happened and what it means."
4. **Explain what you are doing differently**: "Going forward, I am going to [change to prevent this]."
5. **Rebuild trust through consistency**: Follow through on the new approach repeatedly.

**Example**:
Sarah realizes that the operations team felt blindsided by a decision made in steering committee without their input.

*Immediate response*: "I realize I did not involve you in that decision the way I should have. I apologize. Let me explain what the decision was and why. What are your concerns?"

*Clarification*: Explain the decision, the reasoning, and how it affects operations.

*Going forward*: "Going forward, I am going to loop in operations earlier in decisions that affect you. I should have done that here."

*Consistency*: In the next decision, actually loop in operations early. Keep doing it. Trust rebuilds through repeated good behavior.

---

## 7.7 Integrating Communication Across Dimensions

The best communicators integrate all these dimensions simultaneously:
- **Individual preferences** (DISC style)
- **Organizational culture** (formal/informal, hierarchical/flat, etc.)
- **Cultural context** (direct/indirect, relationship/task, etc.)
- **Organizational level** (executive/team/user)
- **Sensitivity of the message** (routine update vs. bad news)

**Sarah's example integrating dimensions**:

*Stakeholder*: Regional Director (Asia-based, hierarchy-conscious, prefers indirect communication, S-style/steadiness)

*Message*: We need regional input on pilot design changes

*Sarah's approach*:
- **Individual preference** (S): Provide detailed context and proposed changes, not just a big-picture idea
- **Organizational level**: Involve him as peer, respectful of his expertise (not directive)
- **Cultural context** (indirect, relationship-first, hierarchy): Use formal respectful language, build in relationship elements, frame as question not directive, use his local manager as intermediary
- **Sensitivity** (moderate—it is a design change but affects his region): Explain the why clearly, acknowledge his perspective will inform the decision, provide clear timeline for input
- **Communication style**: Written summary with detailed information, followed by phone call to discuss (not a surprise meeting)

Result: Regional director feels respected, has time to think and consult his team, understands the rationale, and provides thoughtful input. That is effective communication across multiple dimensions.

## Key Takeaways: Adapting Communication and Cultural Considerations

1. **People have different communication preferences**: Use DISC or similar frameworks to recognize and adapt to them
2. **Organizations have communication cultures**: Understand whether your org is formal/informal, hierarchical/flat, etc., and adapt accordingly
3. **Cultural context affects communication**: Direct vs. indirect, relationship-first vs. task-first, time orientation, hierarchy all matter
4. **Different levels need different communication**: Executives, teams, and end users care about different things
5. **Sensitive communications require extra care**: Bad news, conflict, difficult conversations all have frameworks for managing them well
6. **Communication failures happen**: Recovery is possible through acknowledgment, clarity, and consistent follow-through
7. **Effective communication integrates all dimensions**: Individual preference + organizational culture + cultural context + level + sensitivity

---

## Practice Scenario

**Context**: Your organization (financial services, moderately formal, hierarchical, data-driven, risk-averse) is implementing a new agile process. You have to communicate this to:
- CFO (D-style, executive): Finance person, data-driven, wants business case
- Operations Manager (S-style, team): Process-oriented, needs detailed plan, risk-averse
- IT Team Lead (I-style, team): People-focused, wants to know how it affects team dynamics
- New graduate developers (C-style, team): Detail-oriented, want to understand methodology thoroughly
- Regional office staff (relationship-first culture): Less tech-savvy, needs reassurance

**Design communications for each audience**:
1. What is the core message?
2. What dimension (preference/culture/level/sensitivity) guides your approach?
3. What channel and format would you use?
4. What would you emphasize to each audience?
