# 9e – Knowledge Check: Coaching, Mentoring, and Servant Leadership

This section provides scenario-based practice questions to test your understanding of leadership styles, coaching, mentoring, and servant leadership. These questions reflect the types of leadership challenges you will encounter on the PMP exam—situations requiring you to develop people and lead with purpose.

---

## Instructions

For each scenario, read the situation carefully and select the **best answer** based on the concepts covered in Chapter 9. The best answer aligns with PMI's approach to developing teams and servant leadership.

Answers and detailed explanations follow the questions.

## Scenario 1: Leadership Styles and Development Levels

You are managing a new project. You have three team members with different backgrounds:
- **Elena**: 10 years of experience, senior level, highly skilled in her domain, confident, has managed people before
- **Jordan**: 3 years of experience, solid technical skills, building confidence, wants to grow but sometimes unsure of decisions
- **Sam**: New graduate, first professional job, enthusiastic but inexperienced, needs clear direction

You need to lead each of them effectively over a 12-month project where they will all grow and develop.

**Question 1.1**: For each person, what leadership style would be most appropriate initially?

**Elena**:
A) Directive (high direction, low support)
B) Coaching (high direction + high support)
C) Participative (low direction, high support)
D) Delegating (low direction, low support)

**Answer: D) Delegating**

**Explanation**: Elena is highly experienced, confident, and has shown she can manage herself. She needs autonomy and trust, not direction or support. She will feel micromanaged if you are directive. She will be bored if you coach too much. She wants to lead her part of the project and needs you to get out of the way (while remaining available).

---

**Jordan**:
A) Directive (high direction, low support)
B) Coaching (high direction + high support)
C) Participative (low direction, high support)
D) Delegating (low direction, low support)

**Answer: B) Coaching**

**Explanation**: Jordan has skills and is building confidence. Jordan needs both direction (clarity on what you want) and support (encouragement that they can do it). Coaching is the right balance: "Here is what I want you to work on. I believe you can do this. I will help you. We will check in regularly."

---

**Sam**:
A) Directive (high direction, low support)
B) Coaching (high direction + high support)
C) Participative (low direction, high support)
D) Delegating (low direction, low support)

**Answer: A) Directive**

**Explanation**: Sam is new and uncertain. Sam needs clear direction (here is what you do) and support comes through clear expectations and frequent feedback, not ambiguity. Later, as Sam develops skills and confidence, you will move to coaching, then participative.

---

**Question 1.2**: Over 12 months, how would your leadership approach to each person evolve?

A) Elena stays delegating; Jordan stays coaching; Sam stays directive
B) Elena stays delegating; Jordan moves to participative; Sam moves to coaching, then participative
C) All three eventually move to participative (equal treatment)
D) All three eventually move to delegating (you get out of the way)

**Answer: B) Elena stays delegating; Jordan moves to participative; Sam moves to coaching, then participative**

**Explanation**:
- **Elena**: She is already at delegating level. Over 12 months, you might move to peer relationship, but the leadership approach stays delegating (high autonomy).
- **Jordan**: Starts at coaching, but as Jordan's confidence builds (months 4-6), moves to participative (you are partners; decisions are collaborative). By month 12, Jordan might be ready for delegating on some things.
- **Sam**: Starts at directive (clear tasks, expectations). By month 3-4, moves to coaching (you provide direction + support as Sam's confidence grows). By month 6-9, moves to participative (Sam starts making more decisions). By month 12, Sam is more self-directed.

This illustrates: **Development level changes over time. Your leadership style should adjust as people develop.**

Why other options are less correct:
- A) Assumes development is static; people do grow
- C) Treating everyone the same ignores their individual development levels
- D) Some people should never move to full delegating; they are still learning

**ECO Connection**: People Domain – Task 1: Build and develop the project team

## Scenario 2: Servant Leadership in Action

You are managing a critical infrastructure project with a tight deadline (6 months). Your technical team of 6 people is working hard. Two months in, you notice burnout: people are working late, stress is high, some quality issues are emerging.

One team member, Maya, comes to you and says: "I am exhausted. I do not know if I can keep this pace for four more months. I am thinking about quitting."

You need the team to hit the deadline. What do you do?

**Question 2.1**: What would a traditional command-and-control leader do?

A) "We need you. The deadline is non-negotiable. Here is what you have to do to keep up."
B) "I understand you are tired. But this is what the business needs. Can you push through?"
C) "If you cannot handle this, maybe you are not a fit for this team."
D) "Take it up with your manager if you need to step back."

**Answer: A) "We need you. The deadline is non-negotiable. Here is what you have to do to keep up."**

**Explanation**: Traditional command-and-control leadership prioritizes the goal (deadline) over the person. It uses authority to require compliance. It does not address Maya's underlying concern.

This approach may get short-term results (Maya stays out of fear), but it damages trust and increases turnover risk.

---

**Question 2.2**: What would a servant leader do?

A) "You are right; this pace is unsustainable. Let me renegotiate the deadline with the sponsor."
B) "Let me understand what is exhausting you most. What would help? How can I support you?"
C) "Take a week off to recover. We will cover your work."
D) "Let's figure out together how to make this sustainable. What can I do?"

**Best answer: D) "Let's figure out together how to make this sustainable. What can I do?"**

(B is also a good response; D is slightly better because it invites problem-solving.)

**Explanation**: A servant leader:
1. **Listens**: Understands Maya's exhaustion
2. **Partners**: "Let's figure this out together" not "I will solve this for you"
3. **Serves the person**: "How can I support you?"
4. **Takes responsibility**: "What can I do?" (recognizes that the pace/stress is something leadership can influence)

This response:
- Validates Maya's concern
- Invites her thinking
- Shows you are committed to helping
- Treats her as a partner, not a problem

From there, the conversation might reveal: Maya is most stressed by the quality issues (feels responsible for bugs). Or: Maya is overwhelmed by the late hours (family needs). Or: Maya does not have skills to complete work efficiently.

Whatever the issue, the servant leader problem-solves together, not just commands.

Why other options are less correct:
- A) May not be realistic; might sacrifice deadline; but if done, it shows you prioritize people
- B) Good response, but stops at support; does not invite partnership
- C) Addressing symptom (tiredness) not cause (unsustainability)

This illustrates: **Servant leadership is about serving the person's success, not just the project's success.**

**ECO Connection**: People Domain – Task 1: Build and develop the project team; engage and support team performance

## Scenario 3: Coaching

Your quality lead, Chris, proposes a new approach to testing that is quite different from what you have been doing. You have concerns:
- It might take longer to test
- It has not been tried before (risk)
- You are not sure if it will work

Chris seems enthusiastic about the idea, but you sense some uncertainty too.

**Question 3.1**: How would you respond to coach Chris through this decision?

A) "That is an interesting idea, but I am concerned about time and risk. Stick with the proven approach. We need speed more than innovation."
B) "I like your thinking. Let's try it. If it does not work, we will adjust."
C) "Tell me more about your idea. What problem are you trying to solve? What are the benefits? What are the risks you see?"
D) "Before you propose changes, you need to understand our current process better."

**Answer: C) "Tell me more about your idea. What problem are you trying to solve? What are the benefits? What are the risks you see?"**

**Explanation**: This response:
1. **Shows genuine interest**: "Tell me more"
2. **Helps them think deeply**: Questions about problem, benefits, risks make them examine their idea
3. **Does not dismiss**: You are not saying "No"
4. **Does not just approve**: You are not blindly saying "Yes"
5. **Builds capability**: Chris thinks through their own idea, not just sells it to you

By asking these questions, you:
- Understand Chris's thinking
- Help Chris identify risks (they might, or might not, be comfortable with them)
- Give Chris a chance to build confidence in the idea
- Create dialogue, not direction

If Chris's answers are solid, you might say: "You have thought this through. Let's try it for the first sprint and see how it goes."

If Chris's answers reveal risks Chris is not comfortable with, Chris might say: "Actually, the time risk is too high. Let me refine the approach."

Either way, Chris has grown capability in thinking through ideas.

Why other options are less correct:
- A) Directive: you are deciding without understanding Chris's thinking
- B) Delegating without understanding the idea or risks
- D) Dismissive: shuts down innovation and Chris's thinking

This illustrates: **Coaching helps people think through their own ideas and builds capability.**

---

**Question 3.2**: Over time, how would your approach to Chris change?

A) Stay the same; always coach to help them think
B) As Chris becomes more experienced and confident, move toward delegating (let Chris decide and run with it)
C) As Chris's ideas get better, approve more quickly
D) Gradually move from coaching to mentoring (relationship-based development)

**Best answer: B and D (both are true)**

**Explanation**: As Chris develops:
- **Early on**: Coach through individual decisions (help them think)
- **Months 3-6**: Start delegating some decisions (Chris decides without your approval)
- **Months 6+**: Develop a mentoring relationship (broader career/growth conversation)
- **Long-term**: Peer relationship (you both learn from each other)

This illustrates: **Your leadership approach should evolve as the person develops.**

## Scenario 4: Servant Leadership and Accountability

You are implementing servant leadership: you are trying to support your team, empower decisions, remove obstacles. But now you face a problem:

One team member, Alex, has missed deadlines for three consecutive sprints. The work quality is mediocre. Other team members are frustrated because they depend on Alex's work.

Your boss asks: "Why is Alex still on the team? Why have you not fixed this?"

How do you balance servant leadership with accountability?

**Question 4.1**: What is the right approach?

A) "Servant leadership means supporting people. I cannot hold Alex accountable; that would undermine our trust relationship."
B) "I have been coaching and supporting Alex. The issue is not clear yet. Let me give Alex more time and support."
C) "I have supported Alex. I have also been clear about the standard (on-time delivery, acceptable quality). This is not meeting the standard. I need to have a direct conversation with Alex about this."
D) "I am moving Alex to a different role where the expectations are lower."

**Answer: C) "I have supported Alex. I have also been clear about the standard (on-time delivery, acceptable quality). This is not meeting the standard. I need to have a direct conversation with Alex about this."**

**Explanation**: Servant leadership and accountability are not opposites. A servant leader:
1. **Is clear about expectations**: "Here is the standard" (on-time, quality)
2. **Provides support**: "What do you need from me?"
3. **Checks in**: "How is it going?"
4. **Addresses issues directly**: "This is not meeting the standard. Here is what I am observing. What is going on?"
5. **Supports problem-solving**: "What would help you meet the standard? What can I do?"
6. **Escalates if needed**: "If this does not improve, we will need to have a different conversation"

Servant leadership is not permissive. It is supportive with clear expectations.

Why other options are less correct:
- A) Misunderstands servant leadership as lack of accountability
- B) Soft-pedals the problem; does not address the standard
- D) Avoids the issue rather than addressing it; abdication of leadership

This illustrates: **Servant leadership + clear accountability = effective leadership.**

## Scenario 5: Mentoring for Development

You have been mentoring Jordan for six months. Jordan is a mid-level developer who shows promise but lacks confidence in making architectural decisions. You have been:
- Meeting monthly
- Discussing Jordan's goals
- Introducing Jordan to the architect (for learning)
- Asking about growth

Jordan just came to you and said: "I have an opportunity to lead the architecture for the next component. But I am not sure I am ready. Should I take it?"

How do you mentor Jordan through this?

**Question 5.1**: What would NOT be a good mentoring response?

A) "You are ready. You should definitely take it. It is a great opportunity."
B) "Only take it if you feel completely confident and ready."
C) "What would readiness look like to you? Are you close? What skills do you need?"
D) "Let me think about this and advise you next week."

**Answer: A) "You are ready. You should definitely take it. It is a great opportunity."**

**Explanation**: This response:
- Dismisses Jordan's valid concern (I am not sure I am ready)
- Gives direction instead of helping Jordan think
- Does not address the real question: "How do I know if I am ready?"

Better approaches (like C) help Jordan:
- Define what readiness means
- Self-assess where they are
- Identify gaps
- Make their own decision

Question B is not great either (it is too cautious). But C is the best mentoring response.

---

**Question 5.2**: Jordan decides to take the architecture lead role. One month into the architecture design, Jordan seems overwhelmed. Jordan says: "I am in over my head. Everyone has opinions. I cannot make a decision. I am not the person for this."

How do you mentor through the challenge?

A) "I told you to be careful. You took on too much. Let me take over the architecture."
B) "This is normal. Everyone feels overwhelmed when they step into something new. You will get through it."
C) "Tell me what is most challenging right now. What decisions are you stuck on? Let's walk through your thinking."
D) "You just need more confidence. Keep going. You will figure it out."

**Answer: C) "Tell me what is most challenging right now. What decisions are you stuck on? Let's walk through your thinking."**

**Explanation**: This response:
- Takes the overwhelm seriously (validates the feeling)
- Helps Jordan articulate the real issue
- Offers to think through it together (coaching within mentoring)
- Does not solve it for Jordan (they need to build capability)
- Stays involved and supportive

Why other options are less correct:
- A) Fails to support; withdraws mentoring when Jordan needs it most
- B) Dismisses feelings; does not offer concrete support
- D) Gives generic encouragement; does not address the real issues

This illustrates: **Mentoring includes supporting people through challenges, not just celebrating successes.**

## Scenario 6: Creating a Learning Culture

You are managing a team where several people have made mistakes in recent weeks:
- A developer shipped buggy code that had to be rolled back
- A tester missed critical test cases
- An analyst misunderstood requirements
- A designer proposed a solution that would not work with the architecture

These are real issues affecting the project. But you also want to create a learning culture where people feel safe to fail and learn.

**Question 6.1**: How would you handle this in team meetings?

A) "These mistakes are unacceptable. We need to be more careful. Each person needs to improve their process."
B) "We have had some challenges. Let's use these as learning opportunities. What did we each learn? How will we improve?"
C) "Everyone makes mistakes. Do not worry about it. Let's move on."
D) "I am documenting these issues. If it happens again, we will need to make changes to the team."

**Answer: B) "We have had some challenges. Let's use these as learning opportunities. What did we each learn? How will we improve?"**

**Explanation**: This response:
- **Acknowledges the issues**: Not dismissing them (response C)
- **Reframes failure as learning**: "Learning opportunity" not "Unacceptable mistake"
- **Invites reflection**: "What did we learn?" builds capability
- **Focuses on improvement**: "How will we improve?" is forward-looking
- **Does not blame or shame**: Safe enough for people to be honest

This approach:
- Addresses the problems (they are real)
- Builds learning culture (failure is information)
- Increases psychological safety (people admit problems early)
- Develops capability (people think about how to improve)

Why other options are less correct:
- A) Shaming response; creates fear; people hide problems later
- C) Ignores the issues; does not address real problems
- D) Threatening response; reduces safety

This illustrates: **Learning cultures are built by treating failures as learning, not shame.**

## Final Reflection Questions

**Reflection 1**: You are mentoring a talented person who is getting promoted to a role where you will no longer be their mentor. How do you hand off the mentoring relationship?

Answer: "Congratulations on your promotion. This is well-deserved. As your mentor, I want to help you prepare for this role. Let's talk about the key challenges you might face. I am also going to introduce you to [person] who has been in that role. I will always be available if you need me, but you will not need me the way you did. I am proud of how you have grown."

---

**Reflection 2**: You realize you have been overusing one leadership style (e.g., always being directive). What do you do?

Answer: First, acknowledge it to yourself and maybe your team: "I realize I have been directive. I want to be more collaborative. I might not always do it well, but I am going to work on adjusting my style." Then practice other styles. Ask for feedback. Be willing to be uncomfortable as you stretch.

---

**Reflection 3**: Someone you mentored has left your team or company. How do you feel about that?

Answer: Mixed. Proud that they developed and moved on to bigger opportunities (that is the point of mentoring). Sad to lose them. Secure in knowing that you developed someone who will do great things. The impact of good mentoring lasts beyond the project or job.
