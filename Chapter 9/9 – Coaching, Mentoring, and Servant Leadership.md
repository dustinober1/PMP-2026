# Chapter 9 – Coaching, Mentoring, and Servant Leadership

By month eight, Sarah notices something fundamental has shifted. **She is no longer trying to manage projects or even manage people. She is trying to develop people.**

One of her junior developers, Marcus, was hesitant and relied heavily on Sarah for direction. Sarah could have continued directing him ("Do this, then do that"). Instead, she started asking questions. "What do you think the issue is? What approach would you try? What would success look like?" Over six weeks, Marcus went from needing direction to proposing solutions. He was thinking like a senior developer.

Sarah's agile coach pulled her aside and said, "You shifted something. You went from telling people what to do to helping them figure it out. People are more engaged now."

Sarah realizes that **the highest-impact leadership is not about control or authority. It is about developing the people around you so they become more capable, more confident, and more engaged.**

This chapter focuses on the fourth pillar of the People Domain: how to **lead through coaching, mentoring, and servant leadership**. It is about using your position of authority to develop others rather than just to command them.

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:

- Recognize different leadership styles and their impact on teams
- Understand servant leadership and how it differs from command-and-control
- Coach team members toward their own solutions instead of giving directives
- Mentor people for long-term development, not just project needs
- Create psychological safety so people feel empowered to grow
- Recognize how different ways of working (predictive, agile, hybrid) require different leadership approaches
- Foster continuous learning and improvement in yourself and your team
- Develop high-performing teams by developing individuals

Unlike Chapters 6, 7, and 8, which focused on *team dynamics, stakeholder engagement, and conflict resolution*, this chapter is about *developing the people* who make projects possible.

## ECO Alignment

This chapter addresses the following task from the PMP Certification Exam Content Outline (ECO):

| Domain | Task | Coverage |
|--------|------|----------|
| People | Task 7: Help Ensure Knowledge Transfer | Primary |

**How This Chapter Covers the ECO Task:**

People Task 7 (Help Ensure Knowledge Transfer) requires you to:
- Identify knowledge critical to the project and organization
- Gather knowledge throughout the project lifecycle (not just at the end)
- Foster an environment where knowledge is actively shared, documented, and transferred

**Coverage in This Chapter:**
- **9a**: Leadership styles that encourage knowledge-sharing vs. styles that hoard information
- **9b**: Servant leadership creates psychological safety that enables people to share knowledge without fear
- **9c**: Coaching and mentoring techniques that transfer knowledge through dialogue and guided discovery
- **9d**: Explicit mentoring and continuous learning practices that capture and spread organizational knowledge
- **9e**: Building a culture where knowledge transfer is not a one-time exit activity but an ongoing practice

This chapter emphasizes that knowledge transfer is not just about documentation. It is about developing people—helping them learn, grow, and eventually transfer what they know to others. Your ability to create an environment where people share knowledge freely determines whether your organization learns from projects or repeats the same mistakes.

## Integration: Sarah's Leadership Evolution

As Sarah's three projects progress, her approach to leadership matures:

**Office Renovation Team** (Predictive, ~30 people on contractor staff):
- **Phase 1**: Sarah acted as a coordinator, directing her core team (Facilities Manager, Project Coordinator) and managing the contractor relationship contractually
- **Phase 2 (months 6-12)**: Sarah shifted to coaching her core team. "Here is the situation. What do you think we should do?" The Facilities Manager started making more decisions. Sarah provided guidance, not directives.
- **Challenge**: How do you develop people when the project has a fixed timeline and external constraints? How do you help them grow within a predictive project?

**Expense System Team** (Agile, ~5 core team members):
- **Phase 1**: Sarah was the facilitator/agile coach, helping the team self-organize
- **Phase 2 (months 3-6)**: Sarah shifted to developing individual team members. She mentored the junior developer, coached the QA lead on test strategy, and helped the designer develop leadership skills
- **Challenge**: In a fast-moving agile environment, how do you create space for development? How do you balance sprint velocity with team growth?

**Transformation Program** (Hybrid, ~15-20 people across program):
- **Phase 1**: Sarah was the design lead, driving decisions and direction
- **Phase 2 (months 4-12)**: Sarah shifted to developing the design team and pilot team leaders. She coached them to make decisions, mentor them on change management, and helped them see how their work connects to the bigger vision.
- **Challenge**: How do you develop people across organizational boundaries? How do you build leadership capacity at all levels?

By the end of Chapter 9, Sarah understands that **the legacy of a good project manager is not the project itself. It is the people who became more capable because they worked on the project.**
