# 9b – Servant Leadership in Practice

Sarah's agile coach used a phrase that shifted her thinking: **"Leadership is not about them serving you. It is about you serving them."**

Sarah had always thought leadership was about authority. You tell people what to do, and they do it. But the agile coach—and later, her team—showed Sarah something different.

When Sarah shifted from "I am in charge; I will decide" to "How can I help you succeed?" the entire team dynamic changed. Team members took more initiative. They solved problems without escalating. They told her when something was not working instead of just complaining to each other.

This section teaches you **servant leadership**—a way of thinking about your role as leader that is fundamentally about serving the people on your team.

## 9.1 What Is Servant Leadership?

Servant leadership starts with a simple question: **What can I do to help my team succeed?**

In traditional leadership, the hierarchy goes: leader → followers. The leader's authority flows down. People serve the leader's goals.

In servant leadership, the hierarchy is inverted: the leader serves the team. The team's success is the leader's goal.

### 9.1.1 Core Principles of Servant Leadership

**1. Put the team's success first**
- Your goal is for the team to succeed and develop, not just to complete the project
- You remove obstacles that block them
- You advocate for their needs

**2. Develop people, not just get work done**
- Every task is a development opportunity
- You help people grow and become more capable
- You create stretch opportunities

**3. Listen deeply**
- You try to understand what people really care about
- You ask for their input before deciding
- You are genuinely curious about their perspective

**4. Build trust through consistency**
- You do what you say you will do
- You are transparent about what you know and do not know
- You admit mistakes

**5. Empower decision-making**
- You push decisions down, not hoard them at the top
- You create safety for people to make decisions
- You coach people through decisions, not make decisions for them

**6. Advocate for your team**
- You fight for their needs with leadership
- You shield them from unnecessary chaos from above
- You represent them authentically

**7. Be willing to roll up your sleeves**
- You do not just command; you contribute
- You model the behavior you expect
- You are available and engaged

### 9.1.2 Servant Leadership vs. Traditional Leadership

| Dimension | Traditional Leadership | Servant Leadership |
|---|---|---|
| **Power source** | Position and authority | Influence and trust |
| **Goal** | Get the work done | Develop people while getting work done |
| **Decision-making** | Leader decides | Leader facilitates team decision-making |
| **Problem-solving** | Leader solves problems | Leader helps team solve problems |
| **Conflict** | Leader resolves | Leader helps parties resolve together |
| **Team failures** | Blame the team | Learn and improve together |
| **Communication** | Tell people what to do | Listen and collaborate |
| **Development** | Not a priority | Core priority |
| **Risks** | Managed by leader | Identified and mitigated by team |

## 9.2 Servant Leadership in Action: Sarah's Examples

### Example 1: Removing Obstacles (Office Renovation)

**Traditional approach**: "Here is the project plan. Stick to it."

**Servant approach**: Sarah noticed that the Facilities Manager was spending two hours a day in meetings (status updates, steering committee, vendor calls) and could only spend three hours actually managing facilities. Sarah said: "This is too much overhead. What if I take the steering committee meetings and vendor calls? You focus on facilities management."

Sarah took on more work so the Facilities Manager could do their job well. That is servant leadership.

**Result**: The Facilities Manager could focus on quality and could actually manage daily decisions. Sarah was more useful filtering information than managing the calendar.

### Example 2: Developing People (Expense System)

**Traditional approach**: "You are QA. Test the software."

**Servant approach**: Sarah noticed the QA person was executing test cases but not thinking strategically about test coverage. Sarah said: "I want to develop your test strategy skills. Here is how we approach test planning. Let's work through it together."

Sarah invested time teaching, not just assigning. She was serving the QA person's development.

**Result**: Six months later, the QA person was developing test strategies independently. She stayed on the team (would have left in a directive environment). She could take on higher-level work.

### Example 3: Advocating for the Team (Transformation)

**Traditional approach**: "The steering committee wants a big-bang implementation. Make it happen."

**Servant approach**: The design team felt that phased implementation was better for learning and adoption. Instead of just delivering what the steering committee wanted, Sarah said: "Let me advocate for what you think is right."

Sarah went to the steering committee with data: "The design team is recommending phased implementation because [reasons]. This allows learning and increases adoption risk. The steering committee wants big-bang because [reasons]. Here is my analysis: phased is better for outcomes. I recommend phased."

Sarah advocated for her team's perspective.

**Result**: The steering committee shifted to phased. The team felt heard. Buy-in increased because the team recommended this approach.

### Example 4: Pushing Decisions Down (Expense System)

**Traditional approach**: "The sprint list is decided. Here is what we build."

**Servant approach**: Sarah said to the agile team: "Here is the business need. You decide the features. You are closer to the constraints (time, resources). What would you build first?"

The team decided to build expense routing first, then approval workflows. They felt ownership because they decided.

**Result**: The team executed better because they owned the decision. They were more creative because they had decision authority.

## 9.3 Servant Leadership in Different Contexts

### 9.3.1 Servant Leadership in Agile

Agile is built on servant leadership principles:
- **Scrum Master role**: Serve the team by removing obstacles, protecting from distractions, facilitating self-organization
- **Retrospectives**: "What can we improve? How can I help?"
- **Empowerment**: The team decides how to do the work, not the leader

**Sarah's agile team experience**:
Sarah attended the daily standup but did not run it. The team ran it. If someone was blocked, Sarah said: "What do you need from me?" Then she moved heaven and earth to get it.

If the CFO (product owner) had a last-minute request, Sarah said to the team: "Here is what the business is asking. Does it fit in the sprint? If not, what do we defer?" The team decided, not Sarah.

### 9.3.2 Servant Leadership in Predictive

Predictive projects have more structure and authority. But servant leadership still applies:
- **Planning**: You facilitate; you do not just command
- **Execution**: You remove obstacles, not just monitor progress
- **Escalation**: You advocate for the team's needs, not just report status
- **Development**: You find growth opportunities within the structured project

**Sarah's renovation experience**:
Sarah did not just monitor the Facilities Manager. She said: "What is making this hard? What do you need from me?" She took on vendor management and steering committee management so the Facilities Manager could focus.

When the asbestos issue emerged, Sarah did not just communicate the problem up. She said: "How do we solve this? What do you need?" She worked with the Facilities Manager and contractor to find the solution, not just report the problem.

### 9.3.3 Servant Leadership in Hybrid

Hybrid projects need both structure and flexibility. Servant leadership supports both:
- **Phase 1 planning**: You facilitate (structured but collaborative)
- **Iteration**: You support learning and adjustment
- **Across groups**: You facilitate collaboration between different teams

**Sarah's transformation experience**:
Sarah structured the program (phases, milestones, governance) but facilitated decision-making. The design team decided the process (structure, servant approach). Regional pilot teams decided implementation details (flexibility, servant approach).

## 9.4 Building a Servant Leadership Culture

Servant leadership is contagious. When you model it, others adopt it.

### How to model servant leadership:

**1. Ask before deciding**
- "What do you think?"
- "Help me understand your perspective"
- "What would you do if you were in my shoes?"

**2. Listen fully**
- Do not interrupt or plan your response while they are talking
- Reflect back what you heard
- Verify understanding

**3. Develop deliberately**
- "What skill do you want to develop?"
- "Here is a stretch opportunity. I will support you."
- "You handled that well. Here is what I saw..."

**4. Advocate openly**
- "I went to leadership and argued for this because you recommended it"
- "Here is what I am fighting for with your time constraints"
- "I blocked that request because you told me you were overloaded"

**5. Be transparent**
- "I do not have the answer. Here is what I know. Here is what I will find out."
- "I made a mistake. Here is what I learned. Here is what I will do differently."
- "I do not agree with this decision, but here is what I am committing to"

**6. Roll up your sleeves**
- If the team is crunching, you are crunching
- If someone needs help, you help
- You do not ask people to do things you would not do yourself

**7. Celebrate and recognize**
- "That was excellent work. Specifically, I saw [behavior] and it made [difference]"
- "You handled that conflict really well"
- "I am proud of how this team works together"

### What breaks servant leadership:

**Do NOT**:
- Use authority to override people without explanation
- Ask for input but ignore it (destroys trust)
- Say you develop people but do not invest time
- Advocate for yourself over your team
- Hide information or be dishonest
- Ask people to do things you would not do
- Treat people as means to an end (their development is a side benefit, not a goal)

## 9.5 The Impact of Servant Leadership

**On individuals**:
- Increased confidence and capability
- Higher engagement and motivation
- More likely to stay (loyalty)
- Greater willingness to take on challenges
- Higher satisfaction with work

**On teams**:
- Better collaboration and trust
- Higher quality of decision-making
- More resilience (people solve problems together)
- Better retention
- More innovation (people feel safe proposing ideas)

**On projects**:
- Higher quality outcomes (because people care)
- Better risk management (people surface issues early)
- Higher morale and lower burnout
- Faster problem-solving

**On you as a leader**:
- Higher respect and influence
- Less drama and conflict
- More time (because people self-manage more)
- Greater satisfaction from your work

**Sarah's observation**:
By the end of the projects, Sarah's teams were performing exceptionally well. Not because Sarah was working harder (she was working differently). Not because she was a better technical expert (she was not). But because she had created teams where people felt developed, valued, and trusted. That is powerful.

## 9.6 Servant Leadership and Accountability

A common question: "Doesn't servant leadership let people off the hook? How do you hold people accountable?"

**The answer**: Servant leadership and accountability are not opposites. In fact, servant leaders hold people to higher standards because they invest in their development.

**How to combine servant leadership with accountability**:

1. **Be clear about expectations**
   - "Here is what success looks like"
   - "This is the standard we are holding ourselves to"

2. **Check in on progress**
   - "How is it going? What challenges are you facing?"
   - "Do you have what you need?"

3. **Provide feedback**
   - Positive: "This is what is working well..."
   - Developmental: "Here is where I see an opportunity to grow..."

4. **Address problems directly**
   - "This is not meeting the standard. Here is what needs to change."
   - "What is in the way? How can I help?"

5. **Escalate if needed**
   - "If this does not improve by [date], we will need to have a different conversation"
   - Hold the line, but always offer support

**Sarah's example**:
When the junior developer was missing deadlines, Sarah did not just accept it. She said: "You have missed the last two deadlines. This is affecting the team. What is going on? What do you need from me?"

Turns out the developer was unclear on requirements. Sarah spent an hour explaining and worked with him to set realistic timelines. That is servant leadership + accountability.

## Practice Scenario

**Context**: You manage a team of 8 people. Two months into the project, you notice:
- Two people are highly engaged and delivering excellent work
- Two people seem disengaged, doing the minimum
- Four people are adequate performers but not excited

One of the disengaged people, James, comes to you and says: "I am thinking about leaving. The work is boring. I do not see how I am growing."

**Questions**:
1. How would a traditional leader respond? How would a servant leader respond?
2. What questions would you ask James?
3. What might you do differently to develop him?
4. How would you approach the other four people to increase engagement?
5. What would you do differently across the team to foster a servant leadership culture?
