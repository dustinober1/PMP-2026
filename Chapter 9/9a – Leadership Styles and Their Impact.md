# 9a – Leadership Styles and Their Impact

Sarah realizes that **leadership is not one-size-fits-all. The most effective leaders adapt their style to the person, the situation, and the goal.**

When Marcus was new and overwhelmed, Sarah would direct him: "Here is what I want you to work on today." That was what he needed. But as Marcus grew in confidence and competence, Sarah shifted to coaching: "What would you work on next? How would you approach this?" Marcus responded to this differently. The same directive approach that helped him early would have made him feel micromanaged later.

This section teaches you different leadership styles and how to recognize when to use each.

## 9.1 Core Leadership Styles

Research on leadership identifies several core styles. The most common framework is based on the amount of **direction** (telling people what to do) and the amount of **support** (encouraging and empowering).

### 9.1.1 Directive / Commanding Style (High Direction, Low Support)

**What it is**: You tell people what to do and expect them to do it. You are in control. You make decisions. You give clear instructions.

**How it sounds**:
- "Here is what I need you to do..."
- "Do it this way because I said so"
- "I need this by Friday. Make it happen."
- "Here is the decision. Execute."

**When to use it**:
- **Crisis**: When there is no time for discussion. "The server is down. Everyone work on recovery NOW."
- **New, inexperienced person**: When someone is new and needs clear direction to succeed. "Here are the first three tasks to learn the system."
- **Urgent, simple task**: "Ship this fix by end of day."
- **Clear expert/novice gap**: "I have done this 100 times. I am telling you the proven approach."
- **Safety-critical**: "This is how we handle security. No variations."

**When NOT to use it**:
- With experienced people (they will feel disrespected)
- When you want buy-in or commitment (people comply but do not commit)
- When the person needs to develop decision-making skills
- Long-term (erodes motivation and trust)

**Risks**:
- People become dependent on you
- Creative ideas are missed because you are giving all the directions
- Engagement drops (people are following orders, not thinking)
- When you leave, things fall apart (they do not know how to decide)

**Sarah's example**:
Early on, Sarah directed her Project Coordinator: "Please send a status update to Finance every Friday with budget spend, timeline variance, and risks." The coordinator did it exactly as instructed, every Friday, never thinking about whether the format was useful to Finance. Later, Sarah switched approaches and asked, "What should we be telling Finance? What matters to them?" The coordinator realized Finance only cared about timeline and budget risks, not status details.

### 9.1.2 Coaching / Supportive Style (High Direction + High Support)

**What it is**: You provide direction AND encouragement. You tell people what to do, but you also support them, recognize their effort, and help them understand the why.

**How it sounds**:
- "I want you to take on this task. Here is why it matters..."
- "I know this is challenging. I believe you can do it. Here is how I will support you..."
- "Great effort on that report. Here is what I see that is working well..."
- "You seem unsure about the approach. Let me walk through my thinking..."

**When to use it**:
- **Developing someone**: When someone has potential but lacks confidence or experience. "You are ready for more responsibility. Here is the task. I will support you."
- **Transition to new skill**: "You have been QA for three years. I want to develop your testing strategy skills. Here is what I will teach you. I will be with you while you do it."
- **Maintaining engagement**: "I notice you are bored. Let's talk about what would stretch you and keep you engaged."

**When NOT to use it**:
- With very experienced people (you are micromanaging if you direct them too much)
- When time is critical (less time for explanation and support)

**Strengths**:
- People feel supported and develop confidence
- You transfer knowledge while providing safety
- People understand the why, so they can adapt when situations change
- Engagement stays high

**Risks**:
- Takes more time than pure directive
- Some people may feel you are hovering or checking on them

**Sarah's example**:
Sarah wanted to develop the junior QA person. Instead of just assigning test cases, Sarah said: "I want to develop your test strategy skills. Here is a complex module. What would you test? Why? What risks concern you?" Then Sarah reviewed the strategy, explained her thinking, and the QA person executed it. Over three months, the QA person went from executing test cases to developing test strategies.

### 9.1.3 Participative / Collaborative Style (Low Direction, High Support)

**What it is**: You do not tell people what to do. Instead, you facilitate their thinking, ask questions, and support them in deciding. You are a partner, not a commander.

**How it sounds**:
- "What do you think the issue is?"
- "Here are a few options. What makes sense to you?"
- "I trust your judgment on this. You decide."
- "Help me understand your thinking..."

**When to use it**:
- **Experienced, capable person**: "You know this domain better than I do. I trust your decision."
- **Developing decision-making**: "I want you to make this decision. Here is what I know. What would you do?"
- **Building ownership**: "You proposed this approach. I think it is solid. Go ahead."
- **Complex problem**: "We do not have a clear answer. Let's figure it out together."

**When NOT to use it**:
- With inexperienced people (they need more direction)
- When time is critical (less discussion)
- When clear expertise exists (you should direct)

**Strengths**:
- People develop confidence and decision-making skills
- Ownership and engagement are high
- Creative solutions emerge
- Self-direction increases

**Risks**:
- Takes more time (discussion before decision)
- Inexperienced people may make mistakes
- If the person is not capable, the result may be poor quality

**Sarah's example**:
Sarah shifted the architect's authority. Instead of reviewing his decisions, Sarah said: "You are the technical architect. Here is the vision and business constraint. You decide the technical approach. I trust your judgment." The architect felt trusted and stepped up into full ownership. She made better decisions because she owned them fully.

### 9.1.4 Delegating / Empowering Style (Low Direction, Low Support)

**What it is**: You give someone a task and let them run with it. They have autonomy. You are not heavily involved. You are available if they need you, but you are not hovering.

**How it sounds**:
- "This is your project. Make it happen. I am here if you need me."
- "You own this. Bring me updates when you hit decisions that need my input."
- "I trust you. Go build the team and deliver."

**When to use it**:
- **Very capable, experienced person**: "You know what to do. I do not need to be involved."
- **Mature team**: "You all understand what we are trying to achieve. Run with it."
- **When you are overloaded**: "I cannot be hands-on. I need you to take full ownership."

**When NOT to use it**:
- With someone new or unsure
- When the task is critical and you need to ensure quality
- When the person has not clearly agreed to or understood the task

**Strengths**:
- High autonomy and ownership
- Frees you up for other priorities
- Capable people thrive with this approach

**Risks**:
- If the person is not truly ready, they may fail
- Less guidance means higher chance of misalignment
- If they make mistakes, you share the responsibility

**Sarah's example**:
The Facilities Manager was very experienced and had been managing facilities for years. Sarah said: "This renovation is your project. I am PM, but the facilities plan is yours. I will support at the steering committee level. Make the decisions." The Facilities Manager stepped up fully. Sarah was freed to focus on the sponsor relationship and vendor management.

## 9.2 Situational Leadership: Matching Style to the Person

The key insight is this: **Different people, at different times, need different styles.**

**Situational Leadership** (Hersey & Blanchard) suggests matching your style to the person's development level:

### Level 1: Enthusiastic Beginner (High Task Need, Low Skill, High Motivation)

**Who they are**: New person. Excited about the opportunity. Does not know how to do the work, but wants to learn.

**What they need**: **Direction and Encouragement** (Coaching Style)
- Clear, specific instruction: "Here is what to do"
- Enthusiasm and support: "You can do this!"
- Frequent feedback and check-ins
- Celebrate progress

**What NOT to do**:
- Assume they know how to do the work
- Leave them alone to figure it out
- Give only negative feedback

**Example**: Marcus when he joined the expense system project. He was excited but inexperienced. Sarah gave him clear tasks, explained the why, checked in daily, and recognized his progress.

### Level 2: Disillusioned Learner (Still Building Skills, Enthusiasm Dropping, Facing Reality)

**Who they are**: They have been at the task a while. The initial excitement has worn off. They are discovering it is harder than they thought. Confidence is dropping.

**What they need**: **Continued Direction + More Support** (Still Coaching, or Coaching moving toward Participative)
- Continue clear guidance: "Here is how to approach this"
- Increase support and encouragement: "I know this is hard. You are doing well."
- Acknowledge the difficulty: "This is a challenging skill. Most people struggle here too."
- Check in on confidence and morale

**What NOT to do**:
- Withdraw support (they need more, not less)
- Blame them ("You are not a good developer")
- Leave them to struggle alone

**Example**: The Facilities Manager was two months in and realizing the renovation was more complex than expected (asbestos discovery, budget constraints, timeline pressure). Sarah increased check-ins, acknowledged the difficulty, and provided more support. She said, "You are navigating a lot of complexity. Here is how I am thinking about it. What do you need from me?"

### Level 3: Capable but Cautious (Skilled, Variable Confidence)

**Who they are**: They can do the work. They have demonstrated competence. But they are not fully confident. They may be taking on something new.

**What they need**: **Participation + Encouragement** (Participative/Collaborative Style)
- Less direction, more dialogue: "What would you do here?"
- Continued support and recognition: "I see how you are stepping up. I trust you."
- Involve them in decisions: "This is your call. Here is what I think, but what do you think?"
- Expand responsibility gradually

**What NOT to do**:
- Micromanage (they know how; you are insulting their competence)
- Withdraw support (they still need encouragement)
- Give directive only (they need to build confidence by deciding)

**Example**: One developer had solid technical skills but was hesitant in architecture discussions. Sarah shifted to: "You have a good eye for clean design. What do you see as the risks in this approach?" The developer contributed more because Sarah invited their thinking.

### Level 4: Self-Directed Expert (Highly Skilled, Fully Confident)

**Who they are**: They know their domain. They are confident. They can work independently. They care about the work deeply.

**What they need**: **Autonomy and Minimal Direction** (Delegating/Empowering Style)
- High autonomy: "This is yours. Make it happen."
- Recognition and trust: "I trust your judgment."
- Availability if needed: "I am here if you need me, but I do not need to be involved"
- Opportunity to lead others

**What NOT to do**:
- Micromanage (they will feel disrespected and may leave)
- Direct them (they do not need direction)
- Prevent them from leading (they want to develop others)

**Example**: The Technical Architect was highly skilled and confident. Sarah gave him full authority: "Architecture is yours. You decide. I trust you." He stepped into that role fully and started mentoring others.

## 9.3 Why Leadership Style Matters

**When you match your style to the person's development level**:
- Engagement and motivation increase
- Learning happens faster
- Confidence builds
- Mistakes decrease
- They step into bigger roles

**When you mismatch your style**:
- Directive with experienced people → They feel disrespected, disengage, or leave
- Participative with inexperienced people → They become confused or make mistakes
- Delegation too early → They fail and blame you
- Coaching too long → They become dependent; they do not develop independence

## 9.4 Your Default Style and Flexibility

Most people have a default style—the way they naturally lead. Common defaults:

- **Directive default**: "I am directive because I care about getting it right"
  - Risk: You may over-direct capable people
  - Development: Learn to trust others and delegate more

- **Collaborative default**: "I believe in involving everyone"
  - Risk: You may under-direct inexperienced people; they may feel unsupported
  - Development: Learn to be more directive when needed

- **Empowering default**: "I trust people to figure it out"
  - Risk: You may under-support people who need guidance
  - Development: Learn to coach and direct more

**Sarah's development**:
Sarah's default was Directive (she liked to be in control and ensure quality). Over the project, she stretched to Coaching and Participative. She would have stayed Directive forever if she had not intentionally worked on flexibility. The result was a better team and more people developing skills.

## 9.5 Flex Your Style for Different Situations

Even with the same person, you adjust based on the situation:

**Emergency, high-stakes**: More Directive
- "We have 2 hours to fix this. Here is what you do."

**Routine, lower-stakes**: Less Directive
- "What do you think the approach should be?"

**New skill or role**: More Directive initially
- "I want to teach you this. Here is how..."

**Familiar skill or role**: Less Directive
- "You have this. Go ahead."

**One-on-one conversation about development**: Participative
- "What are your strengths? What do you want to develop?"

**Public, team meeting**: Sometimes more Directive
- Model decisiveness; do not create confusion with too many questions

---

## Key Takeaways: Leadership Styles and Their Impact

1. **Multiple leadership styles exist**: Directive, Coaching, Participative, Delegating
2. **No single style is always right**: Match your style to the person and situation
3. **Situational Leadership framework**: Match to their competence and confidence level
4. **Development level matters**: Beginners need direction; experts need autonomy
5. **Mismatched style creates problems**: Over-directing experts, under-directing beginners
6. **Know your default style**: Most people have a natural approach; work to flex it
7. **Same person, different situations**: Adjust based on stakes, familiarity, context
8. **Flexibility is a leadership skill**: The best leaders adapt; they do not use one style for everyone

## Practice Scenario

**Context**: You have three team members:
1. **Alice**: Senior architect, 15 years experience, highly skilled, fully confident
2. **Bob**: Mid-level developer, 5 years experience, solid skills, building confidence
3. **Charlie**: Junior developer, 1 year experience, learning, enthusiastic but uncertain

All three will work on the expense system project. How should you lead each?

**For each person**:
1. What is their development level? (Enthusiastic Beginner, Disillusioned Learner, Capable but Cautious, Self-Directed Expert)
2. What leadership style should you use with them?
3. What might you say to set expectations for how you will work together?
4. How would you adjust as they grow?
