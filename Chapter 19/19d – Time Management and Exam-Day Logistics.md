## Time Allocation: The Numbers

Let's start with the math:

- **Total time**: 230 minutes
- **Total questions**: 180
- **Average time per question**: 76 seconds

**But this is misleading.** You won't spend 76 seconds on every question. Some will take 30 seconds; others will take 2–3 minutes. The key is balancing.

### Where Time Goes

Here's a realistic breakdown:

| Activity | Time | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|
| **Section 1 startup & tutorial** | 5–10 min | Proctor instructions, interface tutorial |
| **Section 1: 60 questions** | 60–65 min | ~60–65 seconds per question average |
| **Break 1** | 10 min | Use strategically (see below) |
| **Section 2: 60 questions** | 60–65 min | ~60–65 seconds per question average |
| **Break 2** | 10 min | Rest and recover |
| **Section 3: 60 questions** | 60–70 min | May be slower due to fatigue |
| **Review time** | 10–15 min | If you paced well, use this to revisit marked questions |
| **Total** | 230 min | Roughly on budget |

### The Time Budget: What Does 76 Seconds Buy You?

If every question takes 76 seconds, you can complete all 180 questions with 2 minutes to spare. But in reality:

**Fast questions (straightforward, 1–2 concepts tested)**: 45–60 seconds
- Definition-based: "What is a risk response strategy?"
- Procedural: "In what order do you execute these steps?"
- Simple scenario: Clear problem, obvious solution

**Medium questions (1–2 concepts, some decision-making required)**: 60–90 seconds
- Most PMP questions fall here
- Some scenario complexity, but you can identify the core problem relatively quickly
- Multiple options to evaluate, but one is clearly better

**Hard questions (multiple concepts integrated, complex scenario)**: 120–180 seconds
- Multi-part scenarios
- Integration across domains
- Subtle distinctions between remaining options
- Require careful deliberation

**Your strategy**:
- Spend less time on fast questions (get them right in 45–60 seconds)
- Spend your "saved" time on hard questions (use 150+ seconds where needed)
- **Total time still averages ~76 seconds per question**

## Pacing Strategies: How to Stay on Track

### Strategy 1: The Checkpoint Approach

Set mental checkpoints to ensure you're on pace:

| Checkpoint | Questions Answered | Time Elapsed | Expected | Pace Check |
|------------|-------------------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| **After Q20** | 20 | 20 min | 19–20 min | Right on pace |
| **After Q40** | 40 | 40 min | 38–40 min | Right on pace |
| **After Break** (Section 2) | 60 | 75 min | 72–75 min | You're fine; take break |
| **After Q100** | 100 | 115 min | 110–115 min | Right on pace |
| **After Q120** | 120 | 140 min | 135–140 min | Right on pace |
| **After Break** (Section 3) | 120 | 155 min | 150–155 min | You're fine; take break |
| **After Q150** | 150 | 185 min | 180–185 min | Slightly behind, pick up pace |
| **After Q170** | 170 | 215 min | 210–215 min | Finish by 225 min; 5 min buffer |

**How to use checkpoints**:
- Glance at the question timer to see your progress
- If you're ahead of pace at Q40, you're doing well; continue at comfortable speed
- If you're behind pace at Q100, you've spent too long on some questions; pick up speed (but don't sacrifice accuracy)
- If you're behind pace at Q150, you need to move faster on the last 30 questions; allocate 60–75 seconds max per question

### Strategy 2: The Question Navigation Trick

The exam interface shows your progress. Use it strategically:

**Early in each section** (Q1–20):
- Take your time to warm up
- These are often easier questions; use them to build confidence
- Accuracy matters more than speed here

**Middle of each section** (Q21–50):
- Hit your stride
- You're warmed up; now maintain pace
- This is where you spend your time budget efficiently

**End of each section** (Q51–60):
- Questions might be harder (adaptive algorithm), but stay focused
- Don't panic if you're hitting harder questions; it means you've done well
- Maintain your systematic approach

### Strategy 3: Mark and Move

One of the biggest time killers is deliberating too long on a single question.

**When to mark for review**:
- You're genuinely uncertain between two options (not just hesitant)
- You've spent 90+ seconds and haven't narrowed it down
- Your gut tells you to move on

**When to mark for review, DON'T**:
- Re-read the entire scenario
- Try different thinking approaches
- Attempt to predict what PMI "really" wants
- Hope that the rest of the exam will give you context to answer this

**How to mark**:
- Use the exam's "Mark for Review" button
- Move to the next question
- Trust that if you finish the 180 questions with time to spare, you'll have a chance to revisit

**Reality check**: Most test-takers who revisit marked questions change their answer 30–40% of the time. Some changes are correct; some are wrong. If you're unsure, your first instinct is often your best.

**Time saved by using "Mark and Move"**: 5–10 minutes per 180 questions (huge difference)

## Managing Energy and Mental Focus

The PMP exam is 3 hours 50 minutes of intensive mental work. Your brain will tire. Here's how to manage it:

### The Energy Curve

**Minutes 0–20**: Fresh, focused, confident
- You'll likely answer questions correctly
- You're reading carefully
- You feel good about your preparation

**Minutes 20–80**: Peak performance
- Still fresh, but into the groove
- You're working efficiently
- Accuracy is high

**Minutes 80–95**: First fatigue point
- You've answered ~60 questions
- Your brain is getting tired
- Accuracy might dip slightly
- **This is Break 1 — take it**

**After Break 1 (Minutes 105–160)**: Recovery
- The 10-minute break helps significantly
- You've rested; you're somewhat refreshed
- You're back in the groove

**Minutes 160–175**: Second fatigue point
- You've answered ~120 questions
- You're in the home stretch, but fatigue is real
- Accuracy dips again
- **This is Break 2 — take it**

**After Break 2 (Minutes 195–230)**: Final push
- You've had two breaks; this is your last stretch
- You have maybe 35 questions left
- You might feel fatigued, but you can push through

### How to Manage Energy

**During the exam**:

1. **Drink water** (if allowed in the testing area)
   - Dehydration reduces mental performance
   - Even small amounts help

2. **Use breaks strategically**
   - Don't skip breaks to "save time" — the time you gain is usually lost in reduced mental performance
   - Use breaks to rest, stretch, and reset
   - Don't study during breaks; your brain needs rest, not input

3. **Maintain posture**
   - Slouching reduces oxygen to your brain
   - Sit upright; it helps mental performance

4. **Manage self-talk**
   - Negative thoughts ("I'm running out of time," "I don't know this one") drain energy
   - Replace with neutral or positive: "I've studied well," "I can work through this," "Next question"

5. **Accept fatigue as normal**
   - You will feel tired by hour 3. This is normal.
   - Fatigue doesn't mean you're failing; it means you're working hard
   - Power through

### Mental Resilience: Handling Difficult Moments

**You get stuck on a question**:
- Don't panic. You've marked it for review.
- Move on confidently. You have 179 other questions.

**You hit a section of very hard questions**:
- Don't panic. The exam is adaptive; hard questions mean you've been doing well.
- Remember: You don't need to get all of them right.
- Keep your pace; don't slow down and overthink.

**You notice you're behind pace**:
- Stay calm. You can recover.
- Increase your pace to 60 seconds per question for the next 10–20 questions.
- If you're at Q100 and 5 minutes behind, you can make it up.

**You second-guess your earlier answers**:
- Don't go back and change answers unless you marked the question for review.
- Your first instinct is usually correct.
- Moving on is better than dwelling.

## Exam-Day Logistics

### Before You Arrive

**Day before**:
- Review your test center location and parking
- Get adequate sleep (7–9 hours)
- Avoid last-minute studying
- Lay out your ID and other required documents

**Morning of the exam**:
- Eat a good breakfast (protein + carbs, not too heavy)
- Hydrate well
- Arrive 15 minutes early (gives buffer for traffic, parking, check-in)

### What to Bring

**Required**:
- Government-issued photo ID (driver's license, passport, etc.)
- Proof of registration (confirmation email from testing center)

**Leave at home**:
- Phone (absolutely must be stored; bringing it into the exam room disqualifies you)
- Smart watch
- Headphones
- Notetaking materials (pencils, paper provided by test center)
- Study guides
- Anything you think will "help" you remember things

### What to Expect

**Check-in process** (10–15 minutes):
- Proctor verifies your ID and registration
- You'll be patted down or scanned for electronic devices
- Your belongings go into a locker
- You'll receive a locker key and notepad/pencil

**Before the exam starts** (5–10 minutes):
- You'll be seated at your workstation
- The proctor will review the exam rules
  - No talking
  - No electronic devices
  - No leaving the testing area except during scheduled breaks
  - No water at your desk (available outside exam room)
  - Bathroom breaks are allowed but count toward your exam time
- You'll receive a brief tutorial on the exam interface (how to navigate, mark questions, etc.)

**During the exam**:
- The proctor monitors you (some via camera; some in the room)
- If you need to leave (bathroom, water), raise your hand
- The timer runs during your break time, so use it wisely but not anxiously

**After the exam**:
- You'll get an immediate pass/fail notification
- You can request a detailed score report (shows performance by domain)
- Return your notepad and key
- Get your locker and belongings

### Managing Breaks Strategically

**Break 1** (after Section 1):
- **Time**: 10 minutes
- **What to do**: Stand up, stretch, walk if possible
- **What to avoid**: Don't think about how you did on Section 1
- **Mental reset**: Tell yourself, "Section 1 is over; I'm moving to Section 2 fresh"
- **Bathroom**: Use if needed, but don't spend more than 2–3 minutes
- **Water**: Drink some if you need to refresh

**Break 2** (after Section 2):
- **Time**: 10 minutes
- **What to do**: More of the same—stretch, walk, reset
- **Motivation**: You're two-thirds done; you're in the home stretch
- **Don't think about**: Specific questions you struggled with or domains you might be weak in

### Handling Unexpected Issues

**The computer crashes**:
- This is rare, but it happens
- Raise your hand immediately
- The proctor will pause your exam and restart
- You lose no time (the timer pauses)
- Stay calm; the exam will resume

**You run out of time**:
- If you have 10 questions left and 1 minute, you'll be forced to submit unanswered
- This is bad, but not catastrophic (one unanswered question = one wrong)
- This is why pacing matters

**You desperately need a bathroom break**:
- Raise your hand; the proctor will escort you
- **The timer does NOT pause**
- The 2–3 minutes you're gone counts toward your exam time
- Use the bathroom before the exam if possible; minimize during-exam breaks

## Sample Pacing Plans for Different Scenarios

### Conservative Plan: Play It Safe

- Q1–60 (Section 1): 70 minutes (~70 seconds per question)
  - Take your time, build confidence
  - Accuracy over speed
- Break 1: 10 minutes
- Q61–120 (Section 2): 65 minutes (~65 seconds per question)
  - Settling into pace
  - Confidence building
- Break 2: 10 minutes
- Q121–180 (Section 3): 60 minutes (~60 seconds per question)
  - Fatigue creeping in, but you've built a buffer
  - Maintain pace
- Review time: 15 minutes
  - Revisit marked questions with fresh perspective

**Result**: You finish with 15 minutes to spare. You can revisit 5–10 marked questions, potentially improving your score.

### Aggressive Plan: Maximize Review Time

- Q1–60 (Section 1): 60 minutes (~60 seconds per question)
  - Efficient pacing
  - Trust your preparation
- Break 1: 10 minutes
- Q61–120 (Section 2): 60 minutes (~60 seconds per question)
  - Maintain pace
  - Use "Mark and Move"
- Break 2: 10 minutes
- Q121–180 (Section 3): 55 minutes (~55 seconds per question)
  - You're warmed up; move efficiently
  - Fatigued but experienced
- Review time: 25 minutes
  - Revisit 10–15 marked questions
  - Potentially improve score on 2–3

**Result**: You finish with 25 minutes to spare. You have significant time to revisit uncertain answers.

### Middle-Ground Plan: Balanced Approach

- Q1–60 (Section 1): 65 minutes (~65 seconds per question)
- Break 1: 10 minutes
- Q61–120 (Section 2): 65 minutes (~65 seconds per question)
- Break 2: 10 minutes
- Q121–180 (Section 3): 60 minutes (~60 seconds per question)
- Review time: 15 minutes

**Result**: Sustainable pace, reasonable buffer, time to revisit a few questions.

## The 30-Question Problem: You're Behind Pace

This actually happens. Let's say you're at Q150 with 30 questions left, but you've only got 35 minutes (5 minutes behind).

**Don't panic. You can recover.**

- The last 30 questions have an average of 60 seconds each
- You have 35 minutes = 2,100 seconds = 70 seconds per question
- You can do this

**What to do**:
1. **Don't speed up recklessly** (you'll make mistakes)
2. **Be willing to mark more questions for later review** (you might not get back to them, but that's ok)
3. **Trust the basic elimination process** (4 steps: eliminate wrong, eliminate symptoms, eliminate wrong sequence, choose best)
4. **Don't second-guess** (your first read is usually right)
5. **Accept that review time might be minimal** (but you're still on pace to finish)

**If you finish all 180 questions and still have 10+ minutes left**, then you can go back and revisit marked questions with time to think more carefully.

---

## The Five-Minute Buffer Rule

Always try to finish with at least 5 minutes to spare. This buffer:
- Prevents you from feeling rushed at the end
- Gives you a chance to revisit 1–2 questions if needed
- Provides peace of mind that you completed the full exam

If you're on pace to finish with only 2–3 minutes to spare, you might want to pick up the pace slightly (60 seconds per question instead of 70), which compounds over 20 questions.

---

## Connection to Practice and Preparation

Pacing is a skill. You can't learn it on exam day; you must practice it during your mock exams (see section 19e).

When you take practice exams:
- **Use real time limits** (don't give yourself extra time)
- **Track your pace** (note when you finish sections)
- **Practice the "Mark and Move" technique** (get comfortable with it)
- **Identify where you slow down** (technical vs. people domain? Complex scenarios?)
- **Build a pacing plan** that works for you

By exam day, pacing should feel automatic. You'll know your comfortable rhythm, and you'll be able to apply the techniques from sections 19b and 19c without constantly checking the clock.
