## Introduction

A project can deliver a perfect product—on time, on budget, with zero bugs—and still be a failure. Why? Because if no one uses it, or if they use it incorrectly, **no value is created**.

Project Management delivers the "output" (the thing). Organizational Change Management (OCM) delivers the "outcome" (the behavior change). In the modern PMP exam, you are expected to understand that your job doesn't end at "deployment." You must facilitate the **adoption** of your deliverables.

In this chapter, we explore the "people side" of change. It’s not just about training; it’s about psychology, culture, and winning hearts and minds.

## Chapter Structure

*   **18a – Change Impact Analysis and Readiness**: Diagnosing who is changing and how ready they are.
*   **18b – Change Management Strategies and Frameworks**: Using models like ADKAR and Kotter to structure the change.
*   **18c – Communication and Training for Change**: The tactical tools of enabling change.
*   **18d – Managing Adoption and Resistance**: Handling the "Valley of Despair" and turning detractors into champions.
*   **18e – Transitioning Ownership and Sustaining Change**: Ensuring the change sticks after the project team leaves.
*   **18f – Knowledge Check**: Scenario-based questions to test your mastery.

## The Learning Loop

As you study this chapter, ask yourself:
1.  **Who**: Who is actually impacted by this project? (It's often more people than you think).
2.  **Why**: Why would they resist? (Fear, lack of skill, lack of trust).
3.  **How**: How do we bridge the gap between "current state" and "future state"?

### Recurring Themes in Our Scenarios

*   **Transformation Program (Hybrid)**: This is the "heavy lifter" for this chapter. Implementing a global HR system changes the daily workflow of every manager in the company. The technical rollout is easy; getting 5,000 managers to follow the new hiring process is hard.
*   **Office Renovation (Predictive)**: Moving from private offices to an "open plan" layout triggers deep emotional resistance. The project isn't just about moving desks; it's about shifting company culture.
*   **Expense System (Agile)**: The new app is faster, but older employees prefer paper forms. The team must use "Training" and "Gamification" to drive adoption.
