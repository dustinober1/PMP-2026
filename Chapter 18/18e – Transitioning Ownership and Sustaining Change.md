# 18e – Transitioning Ownership and Sustaining Change

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
*   Plan the transition from "Project" (temporary) to "Operations" (permanent).
*   Define "Sustainment" strategies to prevent backsliding.
*   Close the project with a focus on long-term value.

## Core Concepts

### The "Go-Live" vs. "Done" Fallacy
"Go-Live" is the start of value, not the end of the work.
If the project team disbands the day after launch, the change often collapses.

### Transition Plan
A formal document (or backlog items) that details:
*   **Ownership**: Who owns the system now? (The "Business Owner").
*   **Support**: Who fixes bugs? (Help Desk / DevOps).
*   **Maintenance**: Who updates the content?
*   **Knowledge Transfer**: Has the project team taught the operations team how to fish?

### Sustainment: Preventing "Snap-Back"
People tend to snap back to old habits (using the old spreadsheets) if not watched.
*   **Burn the Bridges**: Turn off the old system (Read-only mode).
*   **Measurement**: Track adoption KPIs for 3-6 months post-launch.
*   **Celebration**: Reward the new behavior.

## Practical Examples

### Scenario 1: The Expense System (Agile)
**Context**: The project is ending. The "Dev Team" is moving to a new project.
**Transition**:
*   **DevOps**: The team hands over the CI/CD pipeline and monitoring alerts to the SRE (Site Reliability Engineering) team.
*   **Documentation**: They update the internal wiki with "Troubleshooting Runbooks."
*   **Warranty**: The team agrees to a 2-week "Hyper-care" period where they remain on standby for critical bugs.

### Scenario 2: The Transformation Program (Hybrid)
**Context**: The HR transformation is "live."
**Sustainment**:
*   **Governance**: A "Process Council" is formed, meeting quarterly to review the hiring process.
*   **KPIs**: They track "Time to Hire" and "Manager Satisfaction."
*   **Feedback**: If metrics dip, the Council investigates—ensuring the change is sustained long after the project team is gone.

## Knowledge Check Scenario
**Scenario**: Your project delivered a new inventory software. Three months later, you hear that the warehouse staff is keeping a "secret" paper logbook because they don't trust the software's count.

**Question**: What has failed here?

A) Project Execution
B) Sustainment and Adoption
C) Software Quality
D) Risk Management

**Solution**: **B**
*   **Why**: The software might work perfectly (Execution/Quality), but the *behavior* didn't stick. The trust gap wasn't closed, and the "old way" (paper) wasn't effectively removed or the new way wasn't reinforced. The change was not sustained.
