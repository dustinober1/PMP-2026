# 18c – Communication and Training for Change

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
*   Develop a Communication Plan specifically for OCM (Organizational Change Management).
*   Select appropriate training methods (Job Aids, Classroom, Just-in-Time).
*   Differentiate between "Project Communication" (Status) and "Change Communication" (Adoption).

## Core Concepts

### Communication: The Oxygen of Change
Project communication reports *progress* (timeline, budget). Change communication reports *value* and *impact* (WIIFM, process changes).
*   **Sender-Receiver Models**: Ensure the message sent is the message received.
*   **Feedback Loops**: Change communication must be two-way. You need to hear the concerns (listening tours, surveys).

### The 5 T's of Change Communication
1.  **Targeting**: Right message to the right audience.
2.  **Timing**: Don't communicate too early (anxiety) or too late (rumors).
3.  **Tone**: Empathy and honesty.
4.  **Transmission**: Multiple channels (Email, Video, Town Hall, 1:1).
5.  **Tracking**: Measuring engagement (Open rates, attendance).

### Training Strategy
Training is not "one size fits all."
*   **Classroom/Workshop**: Best for deep skills and culture building.
*   **E-Learning/Video**: Best for simple procedural knowledge (scale).
*   **Job Aids/Cheat Sheets**: Best for "in the moment" support (e.g., a laminated card next to the machine).
*   **Super Users / Champions**: Train a few experts deeply, and let them train their peers (Train-the-Trainer).

## Practical Examples

### Scenario 1: The Expense System (Agile)
**Context**: The app is intuitive, but the accounting rules are complex.
**Strategy**:
*   **Communication**: Weekly "Tip of the Week" emails from the Product Owner.
*   **Training**: Instead of a 4-hour webinar (which everyone hates), they use **Just-in-Time** training. When a user clicks "Foreign Expense," a 30-second video pops up explaining the rule.
*   **Outcome**: Learning happens in the flow of work.

### Scenario 2: The Transformation Program (Hybrid)
**Context**: Changing the entire Supply Chain methodology.
**Strategy**:
*   **Train-the-Trainer**: Sarah identifies 50 "Change Champions" across the global offices.
*   **Bootcamp**: These 50 champions fly to HQ for a 3-day deep dive.
*   **Cascade**: They return to their regions and hold local workshops in the local language.
*   **Benefit**: Peers trust peers more than they trust "HQ Consultants."

## Knowledge Check Scenario
**Scenario**: You are managing a global rollout. You send a detailed email explaining the new process to all 10,000 employees. Two weeks later, adoption is 5%.

**Question**: What was the likely communication failure?

A) The email was too long.
B) You relied on a single channel (Email) for a complex change ("Spray and Pray").
C) The employees are lazy.
D) You should have sent the email on a Tuesday, not a Monday.

**Solution**: **B**
*   **Why**: "Spray and Pray" (sending one mass email and praying people read it) never works for change. Effective change requires multiple channels (Video, Manager cascading, Town Halls) and repetition. The "Rule of 7" states people need to hear a message 7 times in different ways to internalize it.
