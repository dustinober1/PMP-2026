# 18a – Change Impact Analysis and Readiness

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
*   Conduct a Change Impact Analysis to identify *who* is affected and *how*.
*   Assess organizational readiness for change (Culture, Capacity, Competency).
*   Identify the gap between Current State and Future State.

## Core Concepts

### The "Change Gap"
Every project moves an organization from **Current State** (A) to **Future State** (B). The distance between them is the "Impact."

### Change Impact Analysis
This is a structured assessment, usually done early in the project (and revisited often). It asks:
1.  **Process**: What workflows are changing?
2.  **Technology**: What tools are changing?
3.  **Organization**: Are job roles, reporting lines, or teams changing?
4.  **Mindset**: What beliefs or values need to shift?

### Assessing Readiness
Before you launch, you must know if the ground is fertile.
*   **Cultural Readiness**: Does the organization trust leadership? Do they have "change fatigue" from too many recent projects?
*   **Competency Readiness**: Do they have the skills to operate in the new way?

## Practical Examples

### Scenario 1: The Office Renovation (Predictive)
**Context**: The company is moving to "hot-desking" (unassigned seating).
**Impact Analysis**:
*   **Process**: High impact. No longer can you leave photos on your desk. You must book a desk every morning app.
*   **Mindset**: High impact. Employees feel they are losing their "home" and status.
**Readiness Assessment**: Surveys show 60% of staff are "Highly Resistant."
**Action**: Sarah realizes this is not a construction project; it's a culture project. She increases the OCM budget to include "Town Halls" and "Pilot Zones" to acclimate users.

### Scenario 2: The Transformation Program (Hybrid)
**Context**: A new automated supply chain system.
**Impact Analysis**:
*   **Role Impact**: The "Inventory Clerk" role is being eliminated. Those staff will be retrained as "Logistics Analysts."
*   **Gap**: The current clerks do not have the data analysis skills required for the new role.
**Action**: The project identifies a **Skill Gap**. The project scope must expand to include a massive "Reskilling/Upskilling Program" 6 months before go-live.

## Knowledge Check Scenario
**Scenario**: You are rolling out a new CRM to the sales team. You send out a survey and find that the sales team believes the current system is "fine" and the new system is "just management trying to spy on us."

**Question**: How would you classify the readiness of this stakeholder group?

A) High Readiness, Low Urgency
B) Low Readiness, High Resistance
C) Technical Readiness, Cultural Gap
D) Operationally Ready

**Solution**: **B**
*   **Why**: They don't see the need for change ("current is fine") and they actively distrust the motive ("spying"). This is the definition of Low Readiness and High Resistance. You cannot just "train" them; you must address the "Why" (WIIFM - What's In It For Me).
