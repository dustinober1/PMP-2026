# 18b – Change Management Strategies and Frameworks

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this section, you will be able to:
*   Apply the ADKAR model to individual change.
*   Apply Kotter's 8 Steps to organizational change.
*   Integrate these models into your project plan.

## Core Concepts

### ADKAR Model (Prosci)
This model focuses on how *individuals* change. You cannot change a company; you change one person at a time.
1.  **A - Awareness**: Do I understand *why* the change is needed?
2.  **D - Desire**: Do I *want* to support the change? (WIIFM)
3.  **K - Knowledge**: Do I know *how* to change? (Training)
4.  **A - Ability**: Can I demonstrate the new skill/behavior? (Practice)
5.  **R - Reinforcement**: Does the change stick? (Rewards, habits)

*PM Insight*: Most projects jump straight to **Knowledge** (Training) without establishing **Awareness** or **Desire**. This leads to failure.

### Kotter’s 8 Steps
This model focuses on the *organization*.
1.  Create Urgency.
2.  Form a Guiding Coalition.
3.  Create a Vision for Change.
4.  Communicate the Vision.
5.  Remove Obstacles.
6.  Create Short-Term Wins.
7.  Build on the Change.
8.  Anchor the Change in Corporate Culture.

## Practical Examples

### Scenario 1: The Expense System (Agile)
**Context**: Moving sales reps from Excel spreadsheets to a mobile app.
**Applying ADKAR**:
*   **Awareness**: The Sponsor sends a video explaining that Excel errors are costing the company $1M/year (the "Why").
*   **Desire**: The PM highlights that the App creates reimbursement deposits in 2 days vs. 30 days for Excel (The "WIIFM").
*   **Knowledge**: Short tutorial videos.
*   **Ability**: A sandbox version of the app to practice in.
*   **Reinforcement**: First 50 users get a coffee gift card.

### Scenario 2: The Transformation Program (Hybrid)
**Context**: Merging two acquired companies.
**Applying Kotter**:
*   **Urgency**: "We are losing market share; we must merge operations to survive."
*   **Guiding Coalition**: Sarah recruits influential managers from *both* legacy companies to lead the change (not just her own team).
*   **Short-Term Wins**: Instead of waiting 2 years for full integration, they integrate the email systems in Month 1 so everyone has the same "@company.com" address. This builds momentum.

## Knowledge Check Scenario
**Scenario**: You have provided extensive training manuals (Knowledge) to your team for the new process, but they are still not using it. When asked, they say, "We understand how to do it, we just don't see why it's better than the old way."

**Question**: According to the ADKAR model, where is the blockage?

A) Awareness / Desire
B) Knowledge
C) Ability
D) Reinforcement

**Solution**: **A** (specifically Desire)
*   **Why**: They have the **Knowledge** ("we understand how"). They lack the **Desire** ("don't see why it's better"). Sending them to more training will not fix this. You need to go back to the "Why" and the value proposition.
