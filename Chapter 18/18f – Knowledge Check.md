# 18f – Knowledge Check

## Instructions
Answer the following questions to test your understanding of Organizational Change and Readiness.

---

### Question 1
**Scenario**: You are planning a project that will automate 30% of the tasks currently done by the Customer Service team. You anticipate high anxiety and resistance regarding job security.
**Question**: Which action should you prioritize in the Initiating Phase?

A) Create a detailed training plan for the new software.
B) Ignore the rumors until the software is ready to demonstrate.
C) Conduct a Change Impact Analysis and Stakeholder Assessment to understand the specific fears and needs.
D) Ask the Sponsor to send an email promising no layoffs.

**Solution**: **C**
*   **Explanation**: You cannot manage what you don't understand. A Change Impact Analysis (C) gives you the data to build the right strategy.
*   **Why not D?**: Promises might be premature or outside your authority.
*   **Why not A?**: Training is the solution to a knowledge gap, not an anxiety gap (ADKAR: Awareness/Desire comes before Knowledge).

### Question 2
**Scenario**: Using Kotter’s 8 Steps, you have successfully "Created Urgency" and "Formed a Guiding Coalition."
**Question**: What is the immediate next step?

A) Anchor the change in culture.
B) Create a Vision for Change.
C) Generate short-term wins.
D) Train the staff.

**Solution**: **B**
*   **Explanation**: The sequence is 1. Urgency -> 2. Coalition -> 3. Vision. You need a clear picture of the future (Vision) before you can communicate it or generate wins.

### Question 3
**Scenario**: The project is technically complete. The system is installed. However, the "Transition to Operations" activity has not been signed off by the Operations Manager because they claim the documentation is insufficient. The Project Sponsor wants to declare "Success" and close the project to release the budget.
**Question**: What should the PM do?

A) Close the project as "Complete" since the system is working.
B) Hand over the documentation "as is" and let Operations fix it.
C) Refuse to close the project until the Transition criteria are met and signed off by Operations.
D) Escalate to the CEO.

**Solution**: **C**
*   **Explanation**: "Project Closure" requires formal acceptance. If the Operations Manager (the receiver of the product) rejects the handover due to missing criteria (documentation), the project is *not* done. Closing it prematurely creates technical debt and operational failure.

### Question 4
**Scenario**: A stakeholder tells you, "I know we need this new tool, and I know how to use it, but honestly, I'm just too busy to change my workflow right now."
**Question**: Which component of ADKAR is missing?

A) Awareness
B) Knowledge
C) Ability
D) Reinforcement

**Solution**: **C** (Ability) or arguably **D** (Priority/Reinforcement) - *Self-Correction*: In strict ADKAR, "too busy/can't fit it in" is often an **Ability** barrier (psychological or physical barrier to acting) or a **Desire** barrier (prioritization). However, PMI context often frames "Time/Capacity" as an **Ability** constraint.
*   **Refined Explanation**: If they have Knowledge ("I know how") and Awareness/Desire ("I know we need it"), the barrier is the capacity to execute. This falls under **Ability** (Capability/Capacity) or necessitates **Reinforcement** (management making it a priority). *Best fit is Ability (Capacity).*

### Question 5
**Scenario**: Your Agile team is deploying code to production every 2 weeks. The training department complains they cannot update the manuals fast enough to keep up with the changes.
**Question**: How should you resolve this conflict?

A) Slow down the release cadence to once a quarter.
B) Embed a training specialist into the Agile team to update support materials in real-time (as part of the Definition of Done).
C) Tell the training department to work harder.
D) Stop producing manuals; code is the only documentation needed.

**Solution**: **B**
*   **Explanation**: In Agile, we don't slow down value delivery (A) for documentation. We adapt the documentation process. Embedding the change/training work *into* the sprint (B) ensures that the "whole product" (code + enablement) is ready at the same time.
