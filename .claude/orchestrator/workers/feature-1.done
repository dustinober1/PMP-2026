# Feature 1: Review and expand index.md - COMPLETED

## Summary
Successfully expanded guide/08-execution/index.md to create a comprehensive execution overview for PMP students.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. PMP Exam Context (Lines 5-11)
- Added exam weight percentage: **31% of PMP exam** (~55-60 questions)
- Clarified what the exam tests in execution scenarios

### 2. Execution Process Groups Overview (Lines 15-47)
- Listed all 10 executing processes organized by knowledge area
- Added process purpose table showing:
  - Core Integration Processes (2)
  - Resource & Team Processes (4)
  - Communication & Stakeholder Processes (2)
  - Procurement & Risk Processes (2)
- Clarified relationship between Executing and Monitoring & Controlling

### 3. Process Relationships and Integration (Lines 51-93)
- Created visual execution flow diagram showing process sequence
- Documented critical interdependencies between processes
- Added exam trap warning about logical dependency chains

### 4. Key Execution Concepts (Lines 97-147)
- **Data → Information → Reports transformation chain** with examples
- **Approved change requests flow** through change control
- **Deliverables vs. Outcomes vs. Value** distinctions
- **Servant Leadership principles** for execution
- **Progressive Elaboration** in execution context
- Predictive vs. Adaptive execution comparison

### 5. Predictive vs. Adaptive Execution Comparison (Lines 207-249)
- Comprehensive comparison table across 11 dimensions
- Execution cadence comparison (daily, review, retro, planning, reporting)
- **Best first moves** table with scenario-based responses for predictive/adaptive/hybrid
- Exam strategy tip for matching approach to context

### 6. Integration with Other Process Groups (Lines 253-344)
- **Initiating → Executing**: How charter and stakeholder register guide execution
- **Planning → Executing**: How plans and baselines inform execution
- **Executing ↔ Monitoring & Controlling**: Continuous loop with visual diagram
  - Detailed table mapping 11 M&C processes to execution responses
- **Executing → Closing**: How execution outputs enable closure
- **Cross-process group integration scenario**: Real example showing flow through all groups
- Exam pattern tip about stopping to update plans when discovering issues

## Key Enhancements Made

1. **Exam-Ready Reference**: Added exam weight, question distribution, and testing patterns
2. **Complete Process Catalog**: All 10 executing processes with clear purposes
3. **Integration Clarity**: Visual diagrams showing how processes connect
4. **Practical Guidance**: Scenario-based "best first moves" tables
5. **Predictive/Adaptive/Hybrid Coverage**: Comprehensive comparison for all approaches
6. **Cross-Process Understanding**: Clear connections between process groups

## Files Modified
- guide/08-execution/index.md (expanded from 130 lines to ~390 lines)

## Status
✅ COMPLETE - The index.md file is now a comprehensive one-stop reference for PMP students studying execution, covering exam context, all processes, relationships, key concepts, execution approaches, and cross-process group integration.

## Next Steps (for orchestrator)
- Review other files in guide/08-execution/ for similar expansion opportunities
- Ensure consistency across all execution content
- Verify knowledge-check.md covers all new content
