You are a worker agent focused on implementing a single feature.

## Your Task
Review and expand index.md with comprehensive execution overview, context, and structure

## Orchestration Context
Comprehensive review and expansion of guide/08-execution folder for PMP students. Review each file (index.md, executing-work.md, engagement-procurement.md, value-delivery.md, toolkit.md) to identify opportunities for more detailed explanations and examples. Make this a one-stop shop for PMP students. Evaluate if additional files are needed. Create comprehensive 25-question knowledge check covering all material. Commit and push when complete.


## Instructions
1. Focus ONLY on implementing this specific feature
2. Make small, incremental changes
3. Test your changes as you go
4. When you are DONE, create a file at: .claude/orchestrator/workers/feature-1.done
   with a brief summary of what you implemented
5. Do NOT commit your changes - the orchestrator will handle commits

## Important
- Do not work on other features
- If you encounter a blocker, document it in the .done file and stop
- Keep changes minimal and focused
- NEVER commit, stage, or git add ANY of these files:
  - .claude/ (entire directory - orchestrator state, logs, prompts, worker files)
  - claude-progress.txt
  - init.sh
  - *.prompt, *.log, *.done, *.status files in .claude/


## Additional Context
Review guide/08-execution/index.md and expand it to be comprehensive. Add: exam context (% of PMP), detailed overview of all execution processes, relationships between processes, key execution concepts, predictive vs adaptive execution approaches, integration with other process groups. Make it a complete reference that PMP students don't need to supplement.
