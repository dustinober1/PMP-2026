You are a worker agent focused on implementing a single feature.

## Your Task
Create comprehensive 25-question knowledge-check.md covering all execution material with scenarios and detailed explanations

## Orchestration Context
Comprehensive review and expansion of guide/08-execution folder for PMP students. Review each file (index.md, executing-work.md, engagement-procurement.md, value-delivery.md, toolkit.md) to identify opportunities for more detailed explanations and examples. Make this a one-stop shop for PMP students. Evaluate if additional files are needed. Create comprehensive 25-question knowledge check covering all material. Commit and push when complete.


## Instructions
1. Focus ONLY on implementing this specific feature
2. Make small, incremental changes
3. Test your changes as you go
4. When you are DONE, create a file at: .claude/orchestrator/workers/feature-7.done
   with a brief summary of what you implemented
5. Do NOT commit your changes - the orchestrator will handle commits

## Important
- Do not work on other features
- If you encounter a blocker, document it in the .done file and stop
- Keep changes minimal and focused
- NEVER commit, stage, or git add ANY of these files:
  - .claude/ (entire directory - orchestrator state, logs, prompts, worker files)
  - claude-progress.txt
  - init.sh
  - *.prompt, *.log, *.done, *.status files in .claude/


## Additional Context
Create a comprehensive 25-question knowledge-check.md for guide/08-execution covering ALL the material from the expanded files (index.md, executing-work.md, engagement-procurement.md, value-delivery.md, toolkit.md). 

Requirements:
- 25 high-quality, scenario-based questions (not simple recall)
- Cover all major topics: work execution, team development, motivation theories, conflict resolution, procurement execution, value delivery, stakeholder engagement, continuous improvement, etc.
- Include questions on: Tuckman stages, motivation theories (Maslow, Herzberg, McGregor, Vroom, McClelland), conflict resolution techniques, procurement processes, value frameworks (Kano, VSM), benefits realization, measurement (KPIs, OKRs, Balanced Scorecard), PDCA, retrospectives, adaptive vs predictive execution
- Each question should have 4 options with detailed explanations for why each answer is right/wrong
- Match PMP exam style with realistic project scenarios
- Include "Study Topics" section at the end listing what students should master
- Make questions progressively challenging

Review the existing knowledge-check.md first, then expand/replace it to ensure comprehensive coverage of all the new content added to the execution chapter.
