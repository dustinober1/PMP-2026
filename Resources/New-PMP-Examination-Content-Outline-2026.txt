INTRODUCTION
Project Management Institute (PMI) offers a globally recognized professional certification for project
managers, known as the Project Management Professional (PMP)® certification. PMI exam
development processes stand apart from other certification programs. PMI aligns its processes with
the certification industry’s best practices such as those found in the Standards for Educational and
Psychological Testing. The PMP® certification is also accredited against the internationally recognized
ISO/ANSI 17024 standards and ISO 9001 .1
A key development requirement for a fair and reliable certification exam is an analysis of the job being
assessed and a market assessment of standards and industry practices. Given that the PMP is a
global certification, PMI conducted a job task analysis (JTA), which included a criterion-referenced
approach to assessing candidates.
With the emergence of several trends in the profession previously unaddressed in the PMP
certification exam, such as artificial intelligence (AI), and sustainability, it was critical that PMI evaluate
the impacts of these trends on professional practice expectations. These trends were used as
inputs into the JTA to validate their relevance and correlation to tasks included in the PMP
certification exam. Validation ensures that each exam measures the most critical and frequently
performed elements of the project management profession in terms of realistic work settings and
ways of working identified as likely to lead to project success.
The PMP certification exam is a vital part of earning this professional certification; thus, it is imperative
that the exam accurately reflects the practices of project managers. All the questions on the exam
have been written and extensively reviewed by subject matter experts (SMEs) who hold a valid PMP
certification. Scored questions are pretested to confirm their utility in assessing test-takers
accurately and fairly. These questions are mapped to the PMP Certification Exam Content Outline
(ECO) to help ensure an appropriate number of questions are in place for a valid examination.
PMI retained Alpine Testing Solutions to develop the global PMP Certification Exam Content Outline.
Alpine Testing Solutions provides psychometric, test development, and credential management
solutions to credentialing and educational programs.
Finally, there are noticeable differences between this updated PMP Certification Exam Content
Outline and A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK® Guide). The taskforce
members were charged with outlining critical job tasks of individuals who lead, and direct projects
based on their experience and pertinent resources. Each candidate is required to apply project
management concepts and their own experience to on-the-job situations through a series of
scenario-based questions. The PMBOK® Guide is a combination of content, such as principles that
guide behavior, common technical areas, and processes that reflect good practice and ways of
working, to provide the core knowledge that guides activities associated with managing projects.
The PMP certification exam assesses a candidate’s ability to think critically and apply those practices
based on experience leading and managing projects.

internationally recognized ISO/IEC 17024 standard: Conformity Assessment—General Requirements for Bodies Operating Certification of
Persons.

Important note: The research conducted through the JTA validated that today’s project
management practitioners work in a variety of project environments and utilize different project
management development approaches. Accordingly, the PMP certification reflects this and
incorporates approaches across the value delivery spectrum. Predictive, adaptive/agile, and
hybrid management approaches will be found throughout the three domain areas listed above
and are not isolated to any particular domain or task. Approximately 40% of the items will
represent predictive project management approaches, whereas the remaining 60% will be
divided between adaptive/agile and hybrid management approaches. The exact number of items
for each question type and approach may vary by form. Our scoring model is periodically
reviewed by scoring experts to help ensure valid assessment of knowledge and skills. For more
information, please review the exam reporting section of the PMI Certification Handbook.

DOMAINS, TASKS, AND ENABLERS
This document provides details about the structure for the PMP Certification Exam Content
Outline (ECO), including domains, tasks, and enablers as defined by the JTA.
•

Domain: Defined as the high-level knowledge area that is essential to the
practice of project management.

•

Tasks: The underlying responsibilities of the project manager within each
domain area.

•

Enablers: Illustrative examples of the work associated with the task. Please
note that enablers are not meant to be an exhaustive list but rather offer a
few examples to help demonstrate what the task encompasses.

Each PMP certification exam will include questions that address all tasks for a domain, and
PMI will adhere to the percentage of coverage at the domain level as outlined on the
previous page.
Below is an example of the task structure:
People

Domain:
Task statement:

Help ensure knowledge transfer
–

Identify knowledge critical to the project

Enablers: – Gather knowledge
–

Foster an environment for knowledge transfer

The ECO is in alignment with the PMI Thought Leadership report, Maximizing Project Success:
Elevating the impact of the project profession. Elevating the impact on our world research, where
the result was reframing project success to build upon the traditional metrics like schedule,
budget, and scope—the hallmarks of project management success—to a broader perspective
that encompasses stakeholder value and accomplishment of desired outcomes. This extensive
research contributed to a new, consensus view of the definition of project success when the
project was perceived to have delivered value that was worth the effort and expense.

PMP CERTIFICATION ELIGIBILITY
REQUIREMENTS
PMP certification holders are expected to have a robust background, which includes academic and
commercial training as well as professional experience working as a project practitioner. Candidates
for the PMP certification must apply to gain eligibility to take the PMP certification exam.
To be eligible for the PMP certification, you must meet one of the educational and professional
experience paths listed below. All project management experience must have been accrued within
the last 10 years in a professional setting prior to your application submission.
Educational Background

Professional Project Management
Experience
Minimum 60 months/5 years of nonoverlapping experience leading projects in the
past 10 years

Completion of upper-secondary/secondary school (e.g.,
High School Diploma, GED-type secondary equivalency,
Upper-Secondary/School Leaving Certificate) mapped
to EQF Level 4 / ISCED 3–4 (or the national framework
level for upper-secondary completion).
OR
Minimum 48 months/4 years of nonCompletion of a recognized associate’s-level, higheroverlapping
experience leading projects in the
certificate, or advanced technical/vocational program
past 10 years
mapped to EQF Level 5 / ISCED 5 (or national framework
level designated as post-secondary, short-cycle tertiary).
OR
Bachelor’s degree (or higher) from a
Minimum 36 months/3 years of nonoverlapping
recognized/authorized institution; or an advanced
experience leading projects in the past 10 years
professional/vocational qualification that is formally
mapped to EQF Level 6 / ISCED 6 (or the national
framework level designated as bachelor-equivalent).*
OR
Bachelor’s or postgraduate degree awarded by a
Minimum 24 months/2 years of nonprogram accredited by PMI’s Global Accreditation Center overlapping experience leading projects in the
(GAC). (GAC accreditation is a program quality
past 10 years
designation and does not, by itself, change the degree
level required for eligibility).

If your application is selected for an audit, you will be required to provide documentation verifying the
education level and authenticity. If a credential does not cite a framework level, applicants must
supply one of the following: (a) a link or extract from a national qualifications register, (b) an official
statement from the awarding body or relevant ministry confirming the level, or (c) a formal evaluation
by a recognized national body.
*Non-degree qualifications are eligible at this tier only when a competent authority explicitly maps the award to EQF 6 (or national
bachelor-equivalent level). Titles containing “advanced,” “professional,” or “graduate” without an official level mapping
are insufficient.

Project Management Professional (PMP)® Examination Content Outline – July 2026

13

Eligible candidates must demonstrate in their PMP application that their professional experience was
in leading and directing the projects. As defined in the PMBOK® Guide, a project is a temporary
initiative in a unique context undertaken to create value. The temporary nature of a project indicates
a beginning and an end to the project work or a phase of the project work. A project’s unique context
can be driven by its distinct goals, environmental conditions, approaches, stakeholders, or other
dimensions. Projects can be stand-alone efforts or part of a portfolio or program (as defined by the
PMBOK® Guide).

Commercial Training Requirements:
In addition to the above project management experience, PMP certification candidates must also
have taken at least 35 hours of commercial training in project management aligned with topics
covered in the PMP Certification Exam Content Outline (ECO). The coursework must be completed
in the respective sections of the application. You can meet commercial training requirements by
completing courses from any of the following education providers:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

PMI Authorized Training Provider (ATP)
China Registered Education Provider (REP)
PMI Global Accreditation Center for Project Management Education Programs (GAC)
Project Management course(s) from Accredited Higher Education Institution
Employer/company-sponsored programs
Training companies or consultants (e.g., training schools)
Self-paced on-demand training courses including an end-of-course assessment

Post-Secondary Academic Education in Project Management
Verify at least 35 formal training hours of specific instruction that addressed learning objectives in
project management that aligns to the PMP Certification ECO. Record all training hours regardless
of when they were accrued. The coursework must be completed before the certification is
granted.
NOTE: One hour of classroom instruction equals 1 training hour. If you have completed a
university or college course on project management that met for 3 hours per week for 15
weeks, you would record 45 training hours. If only a portion of a course dealt with project
management, only the hours spent on project management can be applied toward the
total.

Learning course hours should cover project-management-related topics as detailed in the PMP
Certification ECO above and may include content on, but not limited to, project scope, project
schedule, project communications, project risk, project procurement, project financials, project
resources, project stakeholders, project integration management, and project governance.
Note that commercial training is not restricted to any specific modality or provider. However, all
training is subject to audit. PMI reserves the right to deem training as ineligible for PMP certification
candidacy based on quality and may, at their sole discretion, disqualify training if it is found to be
of poor quality. Lastly, books and practice exams alone will NOT be accepted as eligible
commercial training.

PMI continues to advance the integrity and trust that define the PMP® certification. While PMI does
not endorse or control third-party training providers, our Authorized Training Partner (ATP)
program helps ensure that candidates who choose to pursue structured learning have access to
consistent, high-quality educational experiences. Candidates are free to prepare in any way they
choose if the training meets the minimum 35 hours and aligns to the ECO. PMI encourages
everyone to exercise caution when engaging with organizations that make misleading claims or
guarantee exam success. PMI investigates credible reports of such misconduct to help preserve
the integrity and fairness of the certification process. In alignment with ISO/IEC 17024:2012
standards, PMI is introducing enhanced verification within the PMP® application system.

Credit for Prior Learning Paths:
If you are an active Certified Associate in Project Management (CAPM)® certification holder, and have
met the educational and professional experience requirements, you will only need to document 12
additional commercial training hours aligned to the PMP Certification ECO. By holding an active
CAPM® certification, you earn a 23-training-hour credit toward the commercial training requirements.
Learn more about the CAPM® certification.
*If you are a graduate of a GAC-accredited degree program, the GAC coursework you completed
can also count toward fulfilling the 35 training-hour requirement. Learn more about the PMI Global
Accreditation Center for Project Management Education Programs (GAC).

How to Record Your Experience and Education on the Application
Use the experience verification section of the online application to record your professional work
experience leading and directing projects. The experience does not necessarily have to be paid work,
but it does need to be in a professional setting. Activities such as school projects, academic research
for a degree-granting program, planning personal events, or home improvement projects do not
qualify. Ensure your project entries do not include any routine, operational, or administrative tasks.

Number of Months of Project Management Experience
All project experience must be recorded individually regardless of the number of projects you include.
Tenure is tracked in months, not the number of projects; therefore, 6 months of project management
experience should be noted as such, regardless of how many projects you led during those 6
months.
Using the example below, the time leading Project I, from 1 January – 31 March, would count as three
months toward the eligibility requirement. Whereas the time leading Project II, from 1 February – 31
May, would count as two months toward the eligibility requirement. You cannot count the time
leading both projects during February–April twice. Therefore, Project I and Project II equal five months
(1 January–31 May) of project management experience toward your eligibility requirement.

scantron or it can be taken online with a proctor. Please be sure to review the exam day instructions
and check-in procedures as outlined in the PMI® Certification Handbook.

In-Person Testing: Computer-Based Testing (CBT) and Paper-Based Testing (PBT)
•

For in-person test center and availability (recommended), please make sure to review test
centers near you by visiting: https://www.pearsonvue.com/us/en/pmi.html

Online Proctored Tests (OPT)
Online proctored exams will require system tests and an extensive check-in process. Please allow
for time prior to the exam to help ensure you complete these processes.
• For testing online via OnVue online proctored, please make sure you review, and complete
necessary system checks by visiting: https://www.pearsonvue.com/us/en/pmi/onvue.html
•

Candidates who are taking an OPT exam may be asked to present their identification to the
proctor after they return from a break, prior to continuing with the exam.

RETAKING THE PMP CERTIFICATION
EXAM
If you do not pass your first exam attempt, we encourage you to continue studying and retake the
exam. You may take the exam up to three times within your 1-year eligibility period. After three
attempts, you must wait 1 year from the date of the last exam before you reapply for the
certification. This policy is designed to uphold exam security and reduce overexposure of exam
questions to individual candidates. However, during this year you are welcome to apply for any
other PMI certification.
If your 1-year eligibility period expires without you passing the exam, even if you have not taken it
three times, you must reapply for the certification. This policy is designed to uphold eligibility and
help ensure all experience included in a candidate’s application aligns to the 10-year limit. However,
in such a case, you will not be subject to a waiting period.
