## Introduction

Sarah received three calls within an hour, all from concerned stakeholders:

The CFO: "Why is the Office Renovation over budget? I thought you had this under control."

The Sales VP: "I heard the Expense System won't have the features we need. Why wasn't I consulted?"

The Change Management Lead: "Employees are confused about the Transformation Program. What happened to our communication plan?"

Six months ago, Sarah would have felt defensive. Now, she recognized these calls as symptoms of a deeper issue: stakeholder engagement had declined during the execution phase. She'd been so focused on managing work that she'd neglected managing stakeholders.

During initiation and planning, Sarah had meticulously identified stakeholders, analyzed their needs, and created engagement plans. But once execution started, she'd fallen into a common trap: assuming stakeholders would remain engaged without ongoing attention.

She learned a hard lesson: **Stakeholder management during execution is different from stakeholder management during planning.** Priorities shift. New stakeholders emerge. Early supporters become skeptics when projects encounter challenges. Communication needs evolve as understanding deepens.

This section explores how to sustain stakeholder engagement, manage expectations through variance and change, and maintain trust throughout the project journey.

## Why Stakeholder Management Changes During Execution

### From Planning to Execution: Shifting Dynamics

**During Planning**:
- High stakeholder interest and engagement (project is new and exciting)
- Focus on defining requirements and approaches
- Stakeholders eager to provide input
- Abstract discussions about future state

**During Execution**:
- Stakeholder attention shifts to other priorities
- Reality doesn't always match expectations
- Trade-off decisions require difficult conversations
- Tangible deliverables invite concrete feedback (and criticism)
- Organizational dynamics and politics intensify

**Common Execution-Phase Challenges**:
- **Engagement fatigue**: Stakeholders tire of meetings and status reports
- **Changed priorities**: What mattered during planning may no longer be critical
- **New stakeholders**: People join or leave; roles change
- **Variance anxiety**: Delays or cost overruns trigger concern
- **Competing initiatives**: Other projects compete for stakeholder attention
- **Implementation resistance**: Users resist change as delivery approaches

---

## Continuous Stakeholder Analysis

Stakeholder analysis isn't a one-time planning activity—it's an ongoing execution responsibility.

### Re-Assessing Stakeholder Power and Interest

From Chapter 7, recall the power/interest grid:
- **High Power, High Interest**: Manage closely
- **High Power, Low Interest**: Keep satisfied
- **Low Power, High Interest**: Keep informed
- **Low Power, Low Interest**: Monitor

**Key Insight**: Stakeholders move between quadrants as projects progress.

**Example – Office Renovation**:

**During Planning**:
- Facilities Director: High power, high interest (project sponsor)
- CFO: High power, low interest (approved budget, then delegated)
- Building Occupants: Low power, high interest (affected by disruption)
- Safety Manager: Low power, low interest (routine compliance)

**During Execution** (after asbestos discovery):
- Facilities Director: Still high power, high interest
- CFO: Now high power, HIGH interest (budget overrun requires CFO approval)
- Building Occupants: Now MEDIUM power, high interest (complaining to executives about timeline)
- Safety Manager: Now MEDIUM power, HIGH interest (asbestos is safety issue)

**Sarah's Response**: She updated her stakeholder engagement approach:
- **CFO**: Added to weekly status distribution; presented at budget review meeting
- **Building Occupants**: Created weekly email update with timeline and disruption schedule
- **Safety Manager**: Invited to CCB for remediation planning

### Identifying New Stakeholders

Execution often reveals stakeholders who weren't visible during planning.

**Example – Expense System**:

During Sprint 5, the IT Security team (not engaged during planning) learned about the expense system and raised concerns about sensitive financial data. They had the power to block production deployment.

**Sarah's Response**:
- Immediately scheduled meeting with Security Lead
- Added Security to sprint review attendees
- Incorporated security requirements into remaining sprints
- Updated stakeholder register and engagement plan

**Lesson**: Proactive stakeholder scanning prevents surprises. Sarah started asking in retrospectives: "Who else needs to know about this? Who could block us?"

## Adapting Communication Strategies

Communication during execution differs from communication during planning.

### From Detailed to Synthesized

**Planning Communication**: Detailed, seeking input
- "Here are five scheduling approaches. Which do you prefer?"
- Focus: Gathering requirements and building consensus

**Execution Communication**: Synthesized, providing updates
- "We're 60% complete, on schedule, 5% under budget. Here are the top three risks."
- Focus: Demonstrating progress and flagging issues

**Balance**: Some stakeholders still need details; others need only summaries. Tailor depth to audience.

### From Proactive to Responsive

**Planning**: Project manager drives communication to gather input
**Execution**: Stakeholders drive communication with questions and concerns

**Sarah's Adaptation**: She shifted from "tell me what you need" (planning) to "here's what you need to know" (execution), while remaining responsive to stakeholder inquiries.

### Communication Channels by Project Phase

**Initiation/Planning**:
- Workshops and collaborative sessions
- One-on-one interviews
- Draft document reviews

**Execution**:
- Status reports and dashboards
- Milestone demonstrations
- Issue escalations
- Change request discussions

**Closing**:
- Acceptance reviews
- Lessons learned sessions
- Celebration events

## Managing Expectations Through Variance

When projects encounter variance—schedule delays, cost overruns, scope changes—stakeholder management becomes critical.

### The Expectation Gap

**Gap = Reality - Expectations**

**If reality exceeds expectations**: Stakeholders are delighted (rare).
**If reality matches expectations**: Stakeholders are satisfied.
**If reality falls short of expectations**: Stakeholders are disappointed or angry.

**Key Insight**: You can't always control reality, but you can manage expectations.

### Proactive Expectation Management

**1. Early Warning**
Don't wait until variance is certain. Alert stakeholders to potential issues as soon as they appear on the horizon.

**Example – Office Renovation**:

**Poor Approach**: Wait until the project is officially two weeks late, then announce the delay.

**Better Approach**: Two months before the deadline, when the electrical contractor first mentioned potential material delays, Sarah alerted stakeholders: "We're currently on schedule, but we're monitoring a risk related to electrical material availability that could add 1-2 weeks. We're working with the vendor to mitigate, but wanted you to be aware."

**Result**: When the delay materialized, stakeholders weren't surprised. Sarah had time to work on mitigation and had preserved trust through transparency.

**2. Frame Variance in Context**

Help stakeholders understand whether variance is significant or acceptable.

**Example – Transformation Program**:

**Without Context**: "We're $150,000 over budget."
**Reaction**: Panic—that sounds like a lot.

**With Context**: "We're $150,000 over budget on a $10M program—1.5% variance. This is within our 5% contingency threshold and is primarily due to the approved scope change for the additional integration workstream."
**Reaction**: Concern, but not panic—stakeholders understand it's managed.

**3. Present Options, Not Just Problems**

Stakeholders want to know what you're doing about issues.

**Poor Approach**: "We're two weeks behind schedule."

**Better Approach**: "We're two weeks behind schedule. I've analyzed three options: (1) accept the two-week delay, (2) crash the schedule by adding resources for $25K, or (3) fast-track by overlapping activities with medium risk. My recommendation is option 2 because it preserves quality and the $25K is within contingency. What's your preference?"

**Result**: Stakeholders feel informed and in control, not blindsided.

### Managing Negative News

**Key Principles**:
- **Be direct**: Don't bury bad news
- **Be timely**: Deliver bad news as soon as you're confident of the facts
- **Be factual**: Stick to data, not emotions
- **Be forward-looking**: Focus on solutions, not just problems
- **Be accountable**: Own mistakes; don't make excuses

**Example – Expense System**:

Sarah discovered that a critical integration with the accounting system wouldn't be ready for Release 1 due to API limitations she'd failed to uncover during planning.

**Her Message to Stakeholders**:
"I need to share an issue. The integration with the accounting system won't be in Release 1. I should have identified this API limitation during planning, but I missed it. This means users will need to manually export data for the first two months until we deliver the integration in Release 2. I apologize for this oversight. We've already started development of the Release 2 integration, and I've put controls in place to prevent similar planning gaps in the future. I'm available to discuss impact and mitigation options."

**Stakeholder Reaction**: Disappointed, but appreciative of Sarah's honesty and accountability. Trust was maintained.

## Stakeholder Involvement in Decision-Making

Not all decisions require stakeholder input, but many benefit from it.

### Decision Authority Framework

**Project Manager Decides**:
- Routine operational decisions
- Resource assignments within the team
- Minor schedule adjustments within float
- Decisions within delegated authority

**Stakeholders Provide Input, PM Decides**:
- Trade-off decisions within approved constraints
- Approach selection when multiple options exist
- Priority adjustments among approved scope items

**Stakeholders Decide**:
- Scope baseline changes
- Budget or timeline extensions
- Major trade-offs (quality vs. schedule)
- Strategic direction changes

**Example – Office Renovation**:

**Sarah Decided**: Which general contractor to assign to the drywall touchup work (within approved budget and scope).

**Sarah Consulted Stakeholders, Then Decided**: Whether to use standard or premium flooring material (within budget; stakeholders expressed preferences; Sarah made final call).

**Stakeholders Decided**: Whether to approve the $15K kitchenette addition (scope change requiring CCB approval).

### Facilitation Techniques for Group Decisions

When stakeholder groups must make decisions together (e.g., at a CCB meeting), the project manager often facilitates.

**Techniques**:

**1. Multi-Voting**
- Each stakeholder gets multiple votes to distribute among options
- Quickly surfaces group preferences
- Useful for prioritizing among many options

**2. Weighted Criteria**
- Define decision criteria (cost, risk, schedule, value)
- Weight criteria by importance
- Score options against criteria
- Calculate weighted scores
- Useful for complex trade-offs

**3. Nominal Group Technique**
- Silent idea generation
- Round-robin sharing
- Clarification and discussion
- Voting
- Useful when power dynamics might inhibit participation

**Example – Transformation Program Decision**:

**Decision**: How to handle a workstream that was falling behind—accept delay, add resources, or reduce scope?

**Process**:
1. Sarah presented three options with cost, schedule, and risk implications
2. Steering committee members scored each option on weighted criteria (strategic value 40%, cost 30%, risk 30%)
3. Weighted scores were calculated and discussed
4. Committee selected "reduce scope" option (highest score)

**Outcome**: Decision made efficiently with stakeholder buy-in.

## Escalation Management

Escalation is a necessary tool, but it must be used thoughtfully to preserve relationships.

### When to Escalate

**Escalate when**:
- Decisions exceed your authority
- Stakeholders are blocking necessary progress
- Risks or issues threaten project success and require senior intervention
- Resource conflicts need higher-level arbitration
- Policy or governance issues require organizational decisions

**Don't escalate when**:
- Issues can be resolved at the project level
- You haven't attempted resolution yourself
- Escalation is punitive rather than problem-solving
- Minor inconveniences don't warrant senior attention

### Effective Escalation Practices

**1. Exhaust Project-Level Options First**
Try to resolve issues directly before escalating. Escalation should be last resort, not first instinct.

**2. Frame as Problem-Solving, Not Complaining**
**Poor**: "The Marketing team won't cooperate."
**Better**: "We need a decision on whether to delay the launch or reduce scope. Marketing prefers delay; Sales prefers reduced scope. I need executive input on this strategic trade-off."

**3. Provide Context and Options**
Don't just dump problems on executives. Give them the information needed to decide efficiently.

**Escalation Template**:
- **Situation**: What's happening
- **Impact**: Why it matters
- **Options Considered**: What you've tried or evaluated
- **Recommendation**: What you think should be done
- **Decision Needed**: What you need from them

**4. Escalate Through Proper Channels**
Follow the governance structure. Don't bypass your sponsor to go to their boss unless absolutely necessary.

**5. Keep Everyone Informed**
No surprises. If you're escalating an issue involving a stakeholder, tell them you're escalating before you do it.

**Example – Expense System Escalation**:

**Situation**: IT Operations team refused to allocate server capacity for the expense system production environment, citing budget constraints.

**Sarah's Approach**:
1. **First**: Discussed with IT Operations Manager to understand constraints
2. **Second**: Explored alternative solutions (cloud hosting, shared infrastructure)
3. **Third**: Reached impasse—IT Operations couldn't budge without budget approval
4. **Escalation**: Sent escalation email to her sponsor (CIO) and IT Operations' director:
   - Situation: Need production environment; IT Operations budget-constrained
   - Impact: Delays Release 1 by 4 weeks
   - Options: Approve $15K infrastructure budget increase, or delay release
   - Recommendation: Approve budget (cost of delay exceeds infrastructure cost)
   - Decision Needed: Budget approval for IT Operations

**Outcome**: CIO approved budget same day. IT Operations allocated servers. No damaged relationships because Sarah escalated professionally and involved everyone.

## Building and Maintaining Trust

Trust is the foundation of effective stakeholder relationships, and it's built through consistent behaviors.

### Trust-Building Behaviors

**1. Transparency**
- Share information openly (good news and bad)
- Admit mistakes and uncertainties
- Don't spin or sugarcoat

**2. Reliability**
- Do what you say you'll do
- Meet commitments
- Communicate proactively if commitments are at risk

**3. Competence**
- Demonstrate expertise
- Make informed recommendations
- Learn from mistakes

**4. Integrity**
- Keep confidences
- Don't speak negatively about stakeholders behind their backs
- Align actions with values

**Example – Office Renovation Trust-Building**:

When Sarah discovered the asbestos issue, she immediately called the Facilities Director (her sponsor) rather than waiting for the weekly status meeting. "I wanted you to hear this from me first," she said. She presented the situation honestly, including her initial failure to require comprehensive environmental testing during planning. She outlined options and made a recommendation.

The Facilities Director later told Sarah: "I appreciated your candor. I know I can trust you to tell me the truth, even when it's uncomfortable. That's the kind of project manager I want."

### Trust-Eroding Behaviors

**1. Hiding Problems**
- Withholding information about issues
- Downplaying risks
- Waiting until crises emerge

**2. Blame-Shifting**
- Making excuses
- Pointing fingers at others
- Failing to take accountability

**3. Inconsistency**
- Saying one thing, doing another
- Changing direction without explanation
- Playing favorites among stakeholders

**4. Over-Promising**
- Committing to unrealistic timelines to please stakeholders
- Agreeing to scope without assessing feasibility
- Claiming certainty when there is none

**Example – Trust Erosion**:

On a different project (not Sarah's), a project manager consistently reported "green" status despite serious schedule issues. When the project finally missed a major milestone, stakeholders felt betrayed. The project manager was removed, and trust in the PMO suffered.

**Lesson**: Short-term discomfort of transparency is far better than long-term damage from hidden problems.

## Managing Difficult Stakeholder Personalities

Not all stakeholders are easy to work with. Effective project managers adapt their approach to different personalities.

### The Micromanager

**Characteristics**: Wants excessive detail; questions every decision; doesn't delegate.

**Approach**:
- Provide detailed status updates proactively (preempt requests)
- Invite to key meetings where they can observe
- Gradually build trust by demonstrating competence
- Set boundaries respectfully

**Example**: The CFO on the Office Renovation project wanted daily updates on spending. Sarah created an automated dashboard the CFO could access anytime, which satisfied the need for visibility while freeing Sarah from daily reporting.

### The Disengaged Stakeholder

**Characteristics**: Doesn't respond to requests; misses meetings; then complains they weren't consulted.

**Approach**:
- Document all attempts to engage
- Make it easy to participate (offer multiple meeting times, async options)
- Escalate if disengagement threatens project success
- Protect the project by documenting decisions made without their input

**Example**: A department head repeatedly skipped sprint reviews, then complained that features didn't meet their needs. Sarah documented all meeting invitations and implemented a policy: "Feedback is welcome at sprint reviews. Changes requested after sprint review will be treated as change requests for future sprints."

### The Scope Creeper

**Characteristics**: Constantly requests additions; sees every request as "small"; doesn't understand trade-offs.

**Approach**:
- Educate about change control process
- Quantify impact of requests (cost, schedule)
- Involve in prioritization decisions (force trade-offs)
- Be assertive about protecting scope baseline

**Example**: A stakeholder on the Transformation Program regularly requested "quick additions." Sarah started responding: "Great idea. Let's add it to the backlog for prioritization. Which of these current features should we defer to make room for this?" The stakeholder quickly became more selective about requests.

### The Blocker

**Characteristics**: Opposes the project; resists decisions; creates obstacles.

**Approach**:
- Understand root cause of resistance (fear, competing interests, past experience)
- Address concerns genuinely
- Find common ground or shared interests
- Involve them in solutions
- Escalate if obstruction is unreasonable

**Example**: An IT manager opposed the Expense System, fearing it would create support burden. Sarah invited him to sprint planning to voice concerns. The team addressed several of his issues (added admin features, created support documentation). He shifted from blocker to advocate.

## Communication During Crisis

When projects face crises—major delays, budget blowouts, quality failures—stakeholder communication becomes critical.

### Crisis Communication Principles

**1. Communicate Quickly**
Don't wait until you have all answers. Acknowledge the crisis and commit to updates.

**2. Be Factual**
Stick to known facts; separate facts from speculation.

**3. Take Accountability**
Own the situation; don't deflect.

**4. Focus on Resolution**
What's being done to address the crisis?

**5. Provide Frequent Updates**
During crisis, increase communication frequency.

**Example – Transformation Program Crisis**:

A critical integration test failed one week before a major phase gate, threatening a highly visible executive demo.

**Sarah's Crisis Communication**:
- **Day 1 (discovery)**: Emailed steering committee: "Integration test failed. We're investigating root cause. I'll update you tomorrow with findings and options."
- **Day 2**: "Root cause identified: data mapping error. We have three options: (1) Fix and re-test, ready in 3 days (risks missing demo), (2) Demo with workaround (lower fidelity), (3) Delay demo 1 week. I recommend option 1 with option 2 as backup. Team is working around the clock. Next update tomorrow."
- **Day 3**: "Fix implemented; testing in progress. Confidence is high we'll be ready for demo. Next update tomorrow unless test fails."
- **Day 4**: "Test passed. Demo is on. Conducting root cause analysis to prevent recurrence."

**Outcome**: Despite the crisis, stakeholder confidence in Sarah's leadership increased because of her transparent, action-oriented communication.

## Maintaining Engagement Through Project Lifecycle

Stakeholder engagement naturally wanes during long projects. Counter this through intentional engagement strategies.

### Engagement Tactics

**1. Celebrate Milestones**
Recognize progress publicly; build momentum.

**2. Vary Communication Methods**
Mix emails, dashboards, demos, and face-to-face to keep things fresh.

**3. Involve Stakeholders in Meaningful Ways**
Ask for input on real decisions, not token involvement.

**4. Share Wins and Learnings**
Highlight team successes; share interesting lessons.

**5. Personalize Communication**
Tailor messages to stakeholder interests.

**Example – Expense System Engagement**:

After six sprints, stakeholder attendance at sprint reviews was declining. Sarah re-energized engagement by:
- **Milestone celebration**: Catered lunch at sprint 6 review (50% of features complete)
- **Personalized invites**: "This sprint includes the mobile receipt capture feature you requested—would love your feedback"
- **Demo format**: Shifted from slide presentation to live system demonstration
- **User involvement**: Invited actual end users to test features during review

**Result**: Attendance and engagement rebounded.

## Summary

Effective stakeholder management during execution:

- **Evolves from planning**: Stakeholder needs and engagement levels change as projects progress
- **Requires continuous analysis**: Regularly reassess stakeholder power, interest, and needs
- **Emphasizes transparency**: Proactive communication about variance and issues builds trust
- **Manages expectations**: Reality minus expectations equals stakeholder satisfaction
- **Involves stakeholders appropriately**: Know when to inform, consult, or delegate decisions
- **Escalates thoughtfully**: Use escalation to solve problems, not assign blame
- **Adapts to personalities**: Tailor engagement strategies to different stakeholder types
- **Maintains engagement**: Intentional tactics counter natural engagement decline

Sarah's transformation from focusing solely on managing work to balancing work management with stakeholder management reflects project management maturity. She learned that stakeholders aren't an interruption to project work—they're integral to project success.

In the next section, we'll explore project closure and transition—how to properly complete projects, capture lessons, transition deliverables, and ensure benefits are realized.
