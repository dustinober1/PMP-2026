## Performance Analysis

After reviewing all answers, reflect on:

1. **Domain Strengths and Weaknesses**
   - Which domain(s) did you score highest in?
   - Which domain(s) need more study?

2. **Question Type Patterns**
   - Did you struggle more with scenario-based questions or definition questions?
   - Were there specific topics that repeatedly caused difficulty?

3. **Reasoning Patterns**
   - Did you recognize PMI's preferred approaches (engage stakeholders, communicate transparently, protect value)?
   - Did you fall for common traps (reactive vs. proactive, symptom vs. root cause)?

4. **Next Steps**
   - Review chapters related to weak domains
   - Take additional practice questions in problem areas
   - Focus on understanding "why" not just "what"

### Flashcard Guidelines

**Good flashcard questions**:
- Test one concept at a time
- Are specific and unambiguous
- Require recall, not just recognition
- Use "What," "How," "When," "Why" questions

**Good flashcard answers**:
- Are concise (1-3 sentences)
- Are complete (don't require looking up additional info)
- Include key details (numbers, names, steps)

**Examples**:

```markdown
**Q**: What are the five stages of Tuckman's team development model?
**Domain**: People | **Chapter**: 6a
**A**: Forming, Storming, Norming, Performing, Adjourning

---

**Q**: If CPI = 0.85, what does this indicate about project cost performance?
**Domain**: Process | **Chapter**: 14a, 14b
**A**: The project is over budget. For every dollar spent, only $0.85 of value is earned. Cost efficiency is 85% of planned.

---

**Q**: What is the primary difference between outputs and outcomes?
**Domain**: Business Environment | **Chapter**: 3
**A**: Outputs are tangible deliverables produced by the project (e.g., a system). Outcomes are changes in behavior or conditions that result from using those outputs (e.g., customers using the system successfully).
